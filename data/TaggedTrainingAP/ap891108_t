 A leak of radioactive water at the state <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>'s research nuclear reactor forced the university to close the unit, the university said Tuesday. In a news release, the university characterized the leak as `` small'' and said there is no threat to public health or safety from the facility, which is located on the school's south campus in the northernmost part of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace-Kobas </PERSON> said a little more than 300 gallons of water from the reactor tank leaked into a storage tank. She said authorities are trying to determine how much is still leaking. The university said the leak was discovered by the reactor's staff Sunday afternoon, when a crew arrived to start it after its weekend shutdown The workers noted that the level of water in the reactor tank, which is normally 30 feet deep, had dropped three inches. The university said the leak has been contained within the reactor facility and is not reaching the public water system or sewer system. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> was told that about 2 gallons an hour were leaking from the tank. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> called the leak a rare occurrence at a reasearch reactor but not very serious because the water is not going out of the facility. He said the radioactivity of the water is `` usually extremely low.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, general manager of the facility, said the leak poses no danger to the reactor but that the reactor was nonetheless shut down to provide `` an additional margin of safety.'' In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have been notified. The reactor will remain shut down until the cause of the leak is identified and repaired, he said. The reactor, which is managed by a private company, produces short-lived radioisotopes for medical research and is also used to study the effects of radiation on materials like reactor components and radiation detection devices.

 Children draw sketches of their homes so they'll remember them later. Their parents no longer repair their huts. Traders do n't bother to drum up new business. <PERSON> Harsud </PERSON> is one of 573 communities destined to be flooded in a giant dam project that pits environmental concerns against <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s attempts at modernization The government says the $ 15 billion project on central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narmada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> will irrigate drought-stricken farmland and provide electrical power Critics say it will displace a million people and destroy the ecology. `` What is the use of the dam that will be our doom?'' said <PERSON> Naginchand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, a local businessman. In September, leading environmentalists and 35,000 villagers descended on <LOCATION> Harsud </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000, in a demonstration to denounce the dam project as a `` human and environmental tragedy.'' A man who runs a grocery store near Sand's fertilizer store said he had planned to expand his business but after the dam project was announced in 1987 `` all my dreams ended.'' `` A sort of gloom descended on the village,'' he added. `` But now with the massive protest there is fresh hope.'' The Narmada dam project in <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state is the largest ever planned in the world. It envisages 30 major, 135 medium and 3,000 minor dams along the 805-mile river and its 41 tributaries. So far three dams have been built. The river is one of the holiest to Hindus. According ancient belief, it was formed by the tears of <ORGANIZATION> Shiva </ORGANIZATION>, one of the gods of the Hindu trinity. The river originates in a pond 335 miles to the east of <LOCATION> Harsud </LOCATION> and courses through lush forests, farmland and narrow rocky gorges in a series of falls and twists before reaching the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s western coast. About 21 million people, 80 percent of them tribespeople and villagers, live in the <LOCATION> Narmada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION>, which is bounded on three sides by mountains and on the fourth by the sea. If the river is dammed, 2,410 square miles of forests and farmland _ an area slightly larger than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ will be submerged and about 1 million people will be displaced, said <PERSON> Ashish </PERSON> <PERSON> Kothari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kalpavriksh </LOCATION>, an independent environmental group. Other independent groups agree with those figures, but no official estimates have been made available. <PERSON> Harsud </PERSON> will disappear under 50 feet of water when one of the major dams of the project, the <LOCATION> Indira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sagar </LOCATION>, is built 15 miles away. The government says the dams are necessary to bring `` an era of prosperity'' to the valley because they will irrigate 20,000 square miles of land in drought-prone areas of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> and adjoining <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state. The project is also supposed to generate 2,700 megawatts of electricity. As for the people who will have to move, the government says it has prepared extensive rehabilitation plans, including monetary compensation. `` Who wants money? I want my land. Will you feel nice if the land that gives you food is drowned?'' said farmer <PERSON> Bhure </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who traveled 155 miles on the roof of a crowded bus to demonstrate in <LOCATION> Harsud </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kothari </PERSON> of the environmental group said there wo n't be enough land left in the area for so many people to live on if the dams are built. To compensate for forest loss, the government plans to plant new forests. <PERSON> Kothari </PERSON> maintained, however, they could not replace the hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals that may have evolved over millions of years. Another objection is the project's $ 15 billion price tag, which some economists say is a gross underestimate. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has promised to lend <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> $ 450 million for the project. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauss </PERSON>, a senior irrigation engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said a project of <PERSON> Narmada </PERSON>'s size is bound to create `` some environmental disturbances.'' `` But the trade-off is that thousands and thousands of people benefit from it. We still feel that the project is technically and economically feasible.'' However, <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Paranjpye </PERSON>, an economist with the governing body of Indian universities, concluded in a study of the project that it is `` economically not viable.''

 In the fashionable French trench, tacky khaki is out and polyester is in. The berets can stay but unpleated pants got their marching orders as the army paraded its new uniforms Tuesday at an unusual fashion show. Not everyone was wild about the styles; some full-figured soldiers complain they may have to wear girdles to squeeze into the new skirt-pants for women. The parade showed blousons for all enlisted persons and straight, pleated pants for men and women. The lighter fabrics and colors with contemporary style and practicality make army gear look made more for fashion than fighting. `` It was time for a change,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forray </PERSON>, chief of staff of the army, who helped engineer the creation of the uniforms, which had not changed for 40 years. The uniforms were ordered from the house of <LOCATION> Balmain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Balmain </LOCATION>, who also recently redesigned uniforms for the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police, was chosen after polls conducted within the army to determine which cuts, colors and fabrics would best suit the needs of today's army. The clothes were designed by <ORGANIZATION> Balmain </ORGANIZATION>'s couture designer <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubert </PERSON>, head of the company's masculine <ORGANIZATION> fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. The fashion parade, after opening with some flamboyant red-white-blue braid-edged redingotes from the time of <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> XV </LOCATION>, displayed what the new officers, gentlemen and women will wear in the service beginning in 1991. The new blousons with a shoulder-to-waist pleat are both sober and chic. The clothes are topped with kepis for officers or sharp berets with wheel-shaped pins. `` And thank heaven they did n't get rid of the kepi,'' said one male fashion observer, who noticed that male officers would still sport the hat silhouette as distinctive as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Khaki </PERSON> is out in the new military palette, a lighter shade of putty or pewter called `` terre de <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' is in, and in a lighter fabric _ a mix of wool and polyester, rather than heavy twill. `` It's more practical, a lot less gear is involved now, and it's more elegant,'' said Capt <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunel </PERSON>. Except for navy blue uniforms for the infantry, the army will wear the new greige, and women will no longer wear their slate blue, but the same putty color as men. `` That's good, and makes women more the equal of men,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gall </PERSON>. `` My wife is in the army too, she'll surely approve.'' A layered look called `` modular'' means officers and gentlemen can go without their coats even when confronting superiors. The light cotton poplin shirts underneath have epaulets, tab pockets and may be substituted for a jacket in warm weather. `` I think the uniforms look very good and easy to wear,'' said Col. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigilant </PERSON> of the artillery corps. `` They give an impression of serenity, which we need in the army. I'm a philosopher _ with my feet on the ground.'' The only sticky problem, so to speak, is in women's skirt-pants, a new knee-length pair of bermuda shorts with a wrapped skirt covering. `` What about real women? I'm waiting to see how the new uniforms will work out on us,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosjean </PERSON>, a full-figured soldier about 5-foot-4. `` A real woman has thighs and a stomach. What happens with these uniforms? We might have to wear girdles.'' And she also thought they might prove difficult in summer. `` We have to sit around on those fake leather chairs all day long.''

 <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON> tries to lead a quiet life at a prestigious <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> university despite being the grandson of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, the revolutionary founder of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I'm just an ordinary student,'' says the shy, chubby sophomore, who wears patched clothes and canvas army shoes. `` I have 20 classes a week, and play badminton and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> chess with classmates.'' The 19-year-old history major at <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has seven roommates in a cramped first-floor dorm room where he sleeps on a bottom bunk and is known simply as `` Sixth Brother.'' Yet, on Saturdays, a black military limousine glides up to take the grandson of the Great Helmsman to an expensive health club, where he enjoys the sauna. On Wednesdays, when he does n't have class, the limo takes <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> home, where he has his clothes washed and an army cook prepares `` good food.'' And mail pours in from people across the country nostalgic about Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, who was virtually deified as a living god by millions of adoring Chinese during his lifetime, and curious about his grandson. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON> is the only child of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s second son, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Anqing </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> translator for the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and novelist <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Raohua </PERSON>, who wrote under the pen name <PERSON> Shao </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>. His home, where his parents and grandmother live, is near the Summer Palace in northwestern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't tell you more than that,'' he says with a chuckle. `` It's a state military secret.'' His favorite class is the history of Sino-U.S. relations, and he spoke excitedly about the recent visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who paved the way to normalizing ties between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1972 with his historic meeting with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. Not that the elder <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s place in history is entirely glorious. Western and Chinese historians alike credit him with the abortive `` Great Leap Forward'' of 1958-59, a drive to increase production that ultimately plunged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into widespread starvation and poverty. He was also behind the disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during which intellectuals and merchants were reviled, schools closed and Red Guards spouting <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> slogans went on a nationwide revolutionary rampage. `` History will judge him as a great man, a leader of great ability, who made great contributions,'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON> says. `` But he had some faults.'' Despite his interest in politics, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> declines to discuss the pro-democracy protests that rocked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this spring, other than to say `` of course'' he did not participate in the marches and demonstrations. He does say, however, that vandals' splattering of the portrait of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> overlooking <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on May 23 `` made me mad. It made all Chinese mad. It was just a couple of guys trying to attract attention.'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> attracts plenty of attention of his own, receiving bundles of unsolicited mail. `` Ordinary people, students, intellectuals, they all write,'' he says. `` Mostly they're nostalgic about Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. But a lot of them say they're very happy I've gone on to college.'' Some are girls who `` just want to be friends.'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> says someday he'd like to visit the hometown of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and see the Lincoln Memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was a progressive capitalist revolutionary, uniting the North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in the civil war,'' he said. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> also takes some philosophy courses. Asked who his favorite philosophers are, he replies, `` <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. And my grandfather.''

 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has agreed to hold talks with the leader of the country's largest white extremist group, the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, his office says. The meeting, to be held at an unspecified time this week, was requested by the movement's leader, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>, and announced Tuesday. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON>'s organization espouses the creation of a whites-only nation in the northeastern third of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Its members often wear khaki uniforms with swastika-like emblems, and <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> often ends his speeches with a Hitler-style salute. <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> asked for the meeting after <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took office in August, met with prominent black anti-apartheid activists and declared his willingness to confer with leaders across the political spectrum. The Afrikaner <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has denounced <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s decision to ease restrictions on anti-apartheid protests and his pledge to extend political rights to blacks In July, <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was `` not man enough'' to run against him for a parliamentary seat. But <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had to quit <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to become president, and <PERSON> TerreBlanche </PERSON> decided not to run for office.

<DATELINE>BANDIKUI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every night in thousands of Indian villages, residents gather around a small television set in the dusty main bazaar for news they once only got third or fourth hand, if at all. Suddenly, people steeped in ancient tradition who seldom venture beyond the next village are plunged into a world of historical pageantry, costume drama, satellite sports or whatever Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> happens to be doing that day. In <LOCATION> Bandikui </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state and even in the most backward of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 550,000 villages, television has become the primary means of education and the main source of information. Only about 20 million television sets serve the country's 880 million people. But Indians already have developed a love-hate relationship with the government-run television network, Doordarshan. And <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, facing a general election later this month, are well aware of the network's enormous influence. Political analysts say the election is likely to be the most uncertain in 22 years. There are no major national issues to swing the vote as in the past four elections. And the governing party, its popularity wavering, stands a chance of losing power for the second time in modern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42-year history. `` It will be the first Indian election in which television will have a major role to play,'' said political analyst <PERSON> Bhabani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. In a nation with 36 percent literacy, the government still wields a powerful monopoly over the two-thirds majority who depend on radio and televison for information. Critics contend the coverage has become so biased toward the prime minister that what is labeled news is merely propaganda for the governing party. `` Television is becoming a serious impediment to free and fair elections. It tilts the balance totally in favor of the ruling party,'' said opposition leader L.K. <PERSON> Advani </PERSON>, minister of <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> and Information during the 1977-79 opposition government. The government denies charges the network has become its propaganda tool. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> `` is not only the president of the ruling party, he is the prime minister of the world's largest democracy. And what he says and where he goes is news,'' said H.K.L. <PERSON> Bhagat </PERSON>, minister of Broadcasting and Information. `` Does the Western media ignore <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' The controversy highlights just how far <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has matured, materially and politically, since <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s grandfather and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, declared television an `` expensive toy'' unsuitable for his poor country Doordarshan, which means `` seen from afar'' in Hindi, debuted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in 1965 with black-and-white broadcasts. The network expanded to other cities by 1972, adding to the country's rapid progress in technology and the rising prosperity of the middle class. Color broadcasts began seven years ago. When <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> coasted to a landslide victory two months after his mother's 1984 assassinatio television reached just 18 percent of the population. But its influence was quickly noticed by the new government. `` To a large number of Indians -LRB- <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> -RRB- is the first <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> prime minister who is also a television personality,'' said <PERSON> Tavleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a political commentator for the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, which has been highly critical of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government. `` Whereas Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> used television mainly for political purposes, rallies, important speeches, her trips abroad, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> has managed to go a step beyond and use it to project himself as a person as well,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. The Doordarshan network now has 18 stations and 340 transmitters beaming to nearly 90 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s villages and cities. The entire country will be within reach by early next year. Critics contend the network's coverage has gone from generally favorable to outright bias. The prime minister and his party have increasingly dominated the 20-minute English and Hindi-language nightly news programs. The opposition has been given short shrift, with coverage often highlighting inconsequential points of leaders' speeches and frequently editing out criticism of the government, critics say. Such tactics have drawn fire from the English language-press, which has dismissed the network as a `` pusillanimous propaganda pustule.'' Some reporters say the network often takes orders directly from the prime minister's office and there is a huge amount of self-censorship. `` No one wants to take a chance with the prime minister's coverage You never know what some hard-line party member will object to,'' said one senior reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, elected as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, says he is hoping to give the laity more of a role in running the church. `` I think we're moving out of a situation in which the only person who was allowed to do anything in the parish was a priest. And I think that's a healthy move,'' said <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. In the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, two of the six people in the bishop's `` inner circle'' are women, and laypeople serve as directors of religious education, visitors of the sick and youth ministers. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, 55, was ordained a priest in 1959, became auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in 1974 and archbishop in 1982 after Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> left for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said he is not sure he could have been a bishop in the days before the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1960s when many prelates were `` brick-and-mortar'' men expected to be adept at handling finances and building new churches. Since Vatican II, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said, what is expected of a bishop is greater grassroots contact with the laity and more pastoral attention to the personal needs of priests. Like his predecessor Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> served as conference vice president, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> is viewed as a moderate who enjoys support from both liberal and conservative camps. `` <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> will play just the role that's needed now. We want a middle-of-the-road stance,'' said Monsignor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremillion </PERSON>, a scholar-in-residence at <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. When asked what are the most important issues facing the church, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> mentioned abortion and euthanasia and economic issues such as Third World debt and the rights of labor unions. In matters of public policy, <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> indicated a willingness to compromise. For example, he said if the question was whether he would tolerate abortions for rape and incest victims if the law were changed to prohibit other abortions, `` the answer is probably yes.'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> said he does not favor a general statement saying the bishops' conference could tolerate condom education in public schools if sexual abstinence was presented as the only morally correct way to prevent AIDS. `` In saying that, you almost necessarily encourage people to engage in premarital sexual activity,'' he said. A document on AIDS approved by the conference's <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was criticized by some bishops for conditionally tolerating condom education, and a second statement on AIDS that attacks condom education is scheduled for a vote Wednesday. If <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> has a fault, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> of the Woodstock Theological Center at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, it may be that he relies too much on intellectual argument to win people to his side. `` Sometimes, it takes more than that to persuade people,'' said <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, author of `` Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` His one weakness may be he may not be political enough.'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>'s term as president will run for three years.

<HEAD>State Orders Company to Remove Train Carrying Sewage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Tuesday ordered a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> company to remove a train carrying 5,000 tons of sewage sludge or face $ 2 million a day in fines. `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is not a dumping ground for someone else's sewage, and this order should ensure that we get rid of it,'' Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the order by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. The train, dubbed the `` poo poo choo choo,'' arrived Friday in <LOCATION> Moss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> after being driven out of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> by residents who complained of its smell. The 63 cars covered with plastic are loaded with 5,000 tons of non-hazardous, treated human waste from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Under the order, <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, will be fined $ 2 million a day retroactive to Nov. 3 if it does n't remove the waste. A hearing to allow the company to challenge the fines was scheduled for Nov. 21, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>' adviser on environmental issues. GSX Vice President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Tuesday night that the proposed fine seemed excessive. In a telephone interview from his <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> home, he said GSX was considering sending the sludge to one of several landfills or to one of several composting businesses and said he believed the company would find someone to take the waste Wednesday. He declined to identify the landfills. GSX contracted with <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to dispose of 12,000 tons of the sludge from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s municipal sewage system at a plant in White Castle, La. An unspecified amount of waste still waits in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the contract allows his company to return the waste if it is turned away at White Castle, but the company in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> has n't wanted to take it back. `` We probably are n't going to take any more of it since this has been such a problem,'' he said.

Instead, it had its final broadcast Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was first last week with an average prime-time rating of 15.2, to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13.7 and CBS' 11.9.

 Voters rejected by a 2-to-1 margin Tuesday a proposal that would have raised the salary of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmakers from $ 7,200 a year to $ 23,300. `` It's a good thing there was n't a ballot alternative that said legislators' pay should be lowered,'' said Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Duncanville </LOCATION>. With 83 percent of the state's precincts reporting, the pay raise was defeated with 614,373 no votes, or 65 percent, to 327,823 yes votes, or 35 percent. Another proposal that would have boosted lawmakers' daily expense allowance from $ 30 to $ 81 was defeated 53 percent to 47 percent. Opponents of the pay hike noted that lawmakers meet only 140 days every other year. Language in the amendment would strip voters of the ability to approve future pay raises by tying lawmakers' salaries to the governor's pay, which the legislature sets <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters faced 21 ballot propositions. A $ 500 million bond issue that would provide money for water projects statewide _ with $ 100 million dedicated to cleaning up substandard communities on the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border _ was leading by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin with 89 percent of the vote in. A $ 400 million bond issue for building prisons and mental health facilities passed by 68 percent to 32 percent. Also approved was the removal of a 113-year-old provision requiring <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> office-holders to swear they won their posts without bribing anyone.

<HEAD>`Spud Trust' to Market Potato Chips in Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The idea may sound a little flaky, but <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fritzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and their <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> partners insist they can turn a profit on a joint venture to make `` upscale'' organic potato chips in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` What you call a potato chip is almost unknown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Valeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Perekhvatov </PERSON>, one of two Soviet partners who signed a joint venture protocol Tuesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Cohens </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that potato chips are a good snack, especially after you have had a glass of vodka,'' he told a news conference called to announce the venture, the <ORGANIZATION> Kartoshka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, which translates from Russian roughly as the `` Spud Trust.'' Not only will chips ease the crunch in the Soviet snack market, said <PERSON> Perekhvatov </PERSON>, but by frying the chips down on the farm and transporting the finished product, the partners hope to avoid one of the most vexing problems of Soviet agriculture: the loss of up to half of the crop in storage and transport. The <ORGANIZATION> Kartoshka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> plans to start small, selling about 100 tons of chips annually, to a very different market than served by the <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s Tabard Farm Potato Chips. Tabard Farm accounts for a tiny fraction of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s annual $ 4 billion potato chip market. The Cohens say they grow `` environmentally sound'' spuds in the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, truck them to <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>'s Potato Chip factory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Amish country, and market them in a few tony stores, restaurants and clubs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Kartoshka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> expects to market about 95 percent of its spuds in regular <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stores, and about 5 percent in the <LOCATION> Beriozka </LOCATION> stores and luxury hotels that cater to Western visitors and accept only hard currency, <PERSON> Perekhvatov </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Cohens </ORGANIZATION> said their low initial investment in the <LOCATION> Kartoshka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trust </LOCATION> will help them avoid what has been a fatal trap for some U.S.-Soviet ventures, a Soviet law that allows the foreign partner to take home only the profits that are made in convertible Western currencies. The Soviet government on Oct. 27 devalued the ruble for a limited number of transactions involving foreign businesses, allowing them to convert at 16 cents on the ruble. But for most transactions, the rate remains at the inflated official level of $ 1.59, and the ban remains on converting from rubles to dollars at the higher rate for repatriating profits. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cohens </ORGANIZATION> said they were content to run a large ruble surplus until they `` find solutions to what now seem to be insurmountable problems'' of getting the money home. Besides, they believe they can obtain the right kind of potato chip kettle for rubles, rather than dollars. Their only other dollar expense is expected to be 10,000 bags for the initial market run, plus plane tickets to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to sign a more formal contract in January, he said. The goal of the operation, at least for the American side, is not large profits but helping the Soviets develop a new type of small-scale food industry, said <PERSON> Fritzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who was a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington-Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, designed to promote friendship between the superpowers. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is `` way ahead of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' in chip technology, acknowledged <PERSON> Perekhvatov </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Kartoshka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trust </LOCATION> will try to bridge that gap by allowing the Soviets to start with a simple, manageable process. The protocol signed Tuesday requires <PERSON> Perekhvatov </PERSON>'s Moscow-based Likino Cooperative, and the <LOCATION> Zybina </LOCATION> farm cooperative near the city of <LOCATION> Tula </LOCATION>, to minimize their use of chemicals and synthetic fertilizers, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. And they will build what he called a `` one-kettle'' chip factory, employing about a dozen people to clean, slice, fry, transport, market and account for the potato chips, he said. `` Because of our small scale, we can help people who can handle this get off to a good start,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` We think that it is a model for economic development in certain parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration must `` run faster'' and plan better to meet increased competition for civil and military technologies from nations such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> advisory board recommends. `` National security can no longer be viewed only in military terms, but must include economic well-being as a key component. ... This is a distinct departure from the past,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an independent group set up to counsel the Pentagon. `` The point is, it is not <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s aggressive roadmap for the future that is at fault. Rather, it has been our own inability to get our act together and create a national vision and set of goals of our own,'' the panel said. The panel issued a strongly worded report that said the current policies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers `` are no longer appropriate'' and may endanger American's global economic and military well-being. `` Our economic, as well as our military security, depends vitally on technological leadership. Technology is the new coinage of the realm and ours has been seriously depleted. ... We can not maintain a lead by conservatism and protectionism. We must run faster!'' said <PERSON> Malcom </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and head of the task group that issued the report. The report touched on the recent controversy over the joint U.S.-Japanese development of the FSX fighter plane, which set off an acrimonious debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over concerns about giveaways of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to nations eager to use <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> expertise to build their own industries. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were angry that the Japanese refused to simply purchase the plane from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a replacement for the F-16, while others argued the deal promoted exchanges of technology and helped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries involved. `` The fragmented policies of the past, in which military security and economic issues were separated, are no longer acceptable,'' <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> said in a letter accompanying the report. `` We must acknowledge this new reality and act accordingly.'' The report, which dealt with the so-called Pacific rim nations, predicted their emerging economic bloc will be the most powerful by the end of the century. It noted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial trade deficit with those countries accounts for two-thirds of the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. It called upon the administration to develop a `` coherent policy'' for long-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with these nations in defense, economics and technological growth, to maintain them as military allies and achieve solid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technological and industrial strength over the long run. `` Our comparative industrial, manufacturing, and technological strength has been eroded seriously over the last decade. This erosion must be reversed so that we can enter cooperative ventures involving technology transfer from a position of strength,'' the panel wrote. The panel called for `` a thoughtful, tough-minded approach,'' and recommended in particular that for U.S.-Japanese relations there must be a `` mutually beneficial, two-way sharing of technology.'' The report noted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s government and industry have worked together to establish that nation as a dominant global player in high-tech industries by the year 2000. `` A coherent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy for defense industrial cooperation is necessary if problems such as those -LRB- that -RRB- arose with the FSX are to be avoided in the future,'' the panel's report stated. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy must promote better coordination'' among such agencies as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. The group said the nation lacks a `` policy framework'' to deal with the complex issue and, among other things, called for the formation of a high-level interagency group to propose such a strategy to the president within six months.

 A government report says the harvest of most 1989 major field crops is completed or soon will be winding down. In the case of winter wheat, the 1990 crop has nearly all been planted and is in `` mostly good to fair'' condition, although more soil moisture is needed in some areas, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday. `` Planting was 93 percent complete, four points ahead of normal'' as of the Oct. 30-Nov. 5 survey week, the report said `` Planting was complete or nearly complete in 13 of the 19 major producing states.'' However, winter wheat planting continued to lag behind normal in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` Rain was needed in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, where the crop was mostly good to fair,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the crop was mostly fair. Russian wheat aphids were a continuing problem in portions of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>.'' The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and Commerce. Its reports cover weather and crop conditions only, not estimates of yields or total production. This year's corn harvest was 88 percent completed by early November, 10 percentage points ahead of normal, the report said. Harvest was almost done in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and advanced sharply in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But the report said corn harvesting lagged behind in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, while it was `` near or ahead of normal'' in the other major producing states. The soybean harvest was reported 87 percent complete, 11 percentage points ahead of normal pace for this time. Farmers had completed harvesting in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and were almost done in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Soybean harvesting made rapid progress during the week in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and eastern Corn Belt, with advances of 20 percentage points or more in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The cotton harvest advanced 12 percentage points during the week of Oct. 30-Nov. 5, including major progress in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the report said Other observations included: _ Sorghum harvesting advanced 13 percentage points during the week and was 85 percent completed, about six points ahead of normal The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> harvest was 86 percent completed, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> crop 80 percent, and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> almost done. _ Rice harvesting was nearly finished in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and `` producers were burning rice stubble as air quality regulations permitted. _ Peanut harvesting was finished in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and continued in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, rain slowed the peanut harvest in the hill country, while the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> harvest was about 20 percentage points ahead of normal. _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s harvest of fall vegetables increased seasonally The sweet potato harvest was at `` a near-normal pace'' in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and vegetable harvesting increased seasonally in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. _ Livestock pastures were said to be in fair-to-good condition in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and the East, and mostly fair-to-poor in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the West

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says a fungus from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is showing up well as a natural killer of destructive grasshoppers that threaten crops and rangeland. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, director of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Grasshopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, said preliminary laboratory experiments indicated the fungus _ Entomophaga praxibuli _ can infect and kill a broad range of the pesky hoppers. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said if the fungus proves out, it could help lessen the need for chemicals to control the pests. The project plan is to integrate the fungus with research demonstrations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> next year, and also begin experiments with it in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` The fungus only affects grasshoppers,'' the agency said Tuesday. `` Laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater than any found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus causes no harm to other insects and does not affect humans or other mammals.'' Grasshoppers are infected by the fungus directly through their outer covering and usually die within 7 to 10 days. Laboratory tests have shown that once established the fungus can also spread to future generations of grasshoppers. The fungus produces spores that survive the winter in the soil, waiting to attack the next year's crop of insects, the agency said. Other biological control agents such as viruses and bacteria take longer to be effective because they must be eaten before infection can occur. Scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an outbreak in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1985. The dry conditions in the <LOCATION> Wanwibinda </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, where this fungus was discovered, were said to be similar to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infest millions of acres of crops and livestock rangelands. `` We believe that further research and controlled introduction of E. praxibuli in our project trials will increase our options by providing and effective long-term biological control agency,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, following a poetic premise by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, says good neighbors need n't help keep up good fences. The five justices on Tuesday found unconstitutional a 1790 law making a livestock owner and neighbor equally responsible for maintaining the fence between their properties. The ruling came 75 years after <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s and the nation's late poet laureate, published `` Mending Wall. In the poem, Frost questions the springtime ritual of helping his neighbor fix the stone wall between their properties, only to have the old farmer respond, `` Good fences make good neighbors.'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> wrote in part: `` ... Before I built a wall I'd ask to know `` What I was walling in or walling out `` And to whom I was like to give offense ... `` In Tuesday's case, offense was taken by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> when adjoining landowners, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrault </PERSON>, refused to help pay for a fence built to keep the Choquettes' cows off the Perraults' land. The Choquettes sued the Perraults for the amount the town fence viewer ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Perraults </ORGANIZATION> owed under state law: $ 316. Two lower courts ruled in the Choquettes' favor, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the Perraults do n't have to pay. The high court's ruling turned on the question of whether the public good outweighed the state Constitution's ban on giving special breaks to special groups _ in this case, landowners with livestock. The court found it made sense in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries to say the public good outweighed the no-special-interests clause. `` The land was predominantly open and farmed, and rural landowners were also livestock owners,'' Justice <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> wrote. Without the fence law, livestock owners would be solely responsible for keeping their animals from damaging their neighbors' property, and solely responsible for the fence, the court said But, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> wrote, `` As a result of changing land-use patterns, the law more and more often applies to landowners without livestock. In such situations, the fence law is burdensome, arbitrary and confiscatory, and therefore can not pass constitutional muster.'' Many have misread <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>'s view of shared fence-mending responsibility as being positive, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, an English professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION>. She pointed to a line in which <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> says, `` In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed `` He moves in darkness it seems to me ... `` `` The old farmer is really being put down,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, `` though it's done so gracefully it almost does n't seem that way at first glance.'' She added, `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> in my opinion would be very pleased to see the court's decision to strike down the fence law.'' Lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON>, whose argument prevailed at the high court, said a lower court judge had cited the `` Good fences make good neighbors'' line in his decision that the high court overturned. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, `` sort of missed the point that <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> was making, that his neighbor was holding onto hidebound tradition,'' Bent said. He added that the legal argument paralleled the poetic: that the <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> fence law was a narrow-minded tradition best discarded. The Choquettes' lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he was disappointed to have lost the case, but could understand the court's logic. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> pointed to <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s comments about shifting land-use patterns, and to a line from another poet named <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>: `` The times, they are a changin'.''

<HEAD>Final Passage Given Bill Calling for Investigation of Eastern Strike</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready to launch an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who refused to intervene when the walkout began eight months ago, may veto the bill calling for the review. Legislation creating a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> commission won final approval Monday in the House. But the administration said its position had not changed since last month, when it issued a statement saying the measure was a candidate for a veto. The bill, approved on a voice vote, is a watered-down version of organized labor's initial attempt to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to demand that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> use his power to halt the strike by naming an emergency mediation board. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said then that the dispute should be settled by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and management. Instead of demanding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervene, the bill now headed to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would create a four-member panel to recommend ways to end the Eastern strike. It also would make suggestions for maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry and for protecting employees of air carriers that seek bankruptcy protection. Labor urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reconsider his veto threat. `` We urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said in a statement. `` For the president to do otherwise would strip the administration of any pretense of fairness in this dispute.'' Under the bill, a Democrat and a Republican from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and one each from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be appointed by their respective leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the commission. The panel's report would be due 45 days after enactment. Its recommendations, should they include presidential intervention, would not be binding on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but could lead to additional legislation. Eastern was struck by the Machinists' union March 4 and most union pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout. The airline, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began and although still cash-poor has been rebuilding as a non-union carrier. The unions have contended that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has siphoned Eastern cash and assets for the parent corporation and wants to use bankruptcy to bust the unions, as he did when <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, filed for Chapter 11 and then emerged as a non-union carrier <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has said concessions by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s union workers were necessary for it to remain competitive.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Place Independent Watchdog in CIA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a spinoff from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's Iran-Contra scandal, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is moving to set up for the first time an independent watchdog inside the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Senators voted 64-34 late Tuesday to keep the independent inspector general provision in a bill authorizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence activities for the next two years. The provision, offered by Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., would create an independent <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general, nominated by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> The current inspector general is appointed by the director and reports only to him. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is strongly opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. The intelligence bill later was passed on a voice vote and sent to a conference to work out differences between it and a version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month. The House bill would retain the current system for appointing the inspector general, but would require full access to the investigator's reports and audits by the intelligence committees on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approach also is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and would tempt a veto, the administration has said. In its Iran-Contra investigation two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concluded the scandal escaped the notice of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general because the office did not have `` the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover what had gone on. Among its recommendations was an independent investigator at the agency like the arrangement approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The implication was that the agency's overseer had turned a blind eye to the activities of his boss, then-CIA director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who was deeply involved in the scandal that sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and clandestine funds to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` Iran-Contra was a very significant event in our history and there are some lessons to learn from it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the special panel that investigated the scandal. `` We had the potential to have a government within a government, selling assets and using the money to run operations with no trail, no trace and no one would know,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` We nearly saw the unraveling of a presidency.'' Others, including Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, sought to link the provision to a new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policy that will free <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operatives to work with the plotters of coups in countries like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, so long as the coup is not aimed at assassinating a foreign leader. They argued stronger agency oversight would help keep such a policy from running out of control. Several senators sought to strip out the new reins on the agency, saying the restrictions would appear to be a slap at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and could hamper the agency's ability to win cooperation from intelligence sources and other countries. `` They would n't be dealing just with one organization, they would be dealing with two parallel organizations that exist side by side, with two chains of command,'' argued Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. Under the provision, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director would be able to shut down an inspector general's investigation if he felt it were dangerous to national security, but would have to inform the congressional intelligence committees of his action within seven days. The overall intelligence bill provides a blueprint for the government's intelligence spending over the next two years. Most of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends on such activities is secret, tucked away in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. But reports put the spending level at upwards of $ 25 billion a year, most of it for personnel and spy hardware like satellites, and lesser amounts for covert operations overseas.

 Homeowners who feel burdened by the chore of raking up autumn leaves might feel better if they consider the plight of highway departments. Take <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON>, highway superintendent in the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>. He figures his city's trees will shed about 2,200 truckloads of leaves this fall. It'll take 80 workers, using 44 pieces of equipment, to sweep up the 800 miles of curbs. In <LOCATION> Cheektowaga </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb, Highway Superintendent <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowal </PERSON> will run seven leaf vacuums for 16 hours a day, seven days a week to keep the streets clean. And even that is n't holding off an estimated 200 calls a day _ many from irate residents demanding better leaf service `` It's crazy,'' <PERSON> Kowal </PERSON> said. `` These four weeks are my nightmare. I dread it every year. We can deal with snow. We can deal with everything but leaves.''

 The nation's former chief thrift regulator says he was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> to drop a rule barring risky investments by the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose owner was a major political contributor. Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, D-Ariz., made the request to him in an April 2, 1987, meeting in <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s office attended by three other The four senators _ who received $ 1.3 million in contributions arranged by <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who controlled <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ all have acknowledged they were at the meeting but denied knowledge of such a request. The others present at the meeting, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> testified, were Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> The other three senators, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> testified, `` raised no objection whatsoever'' when <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> proposed `` that I withdraw a duly adopted regulation on behalf of their ` friend' and their contributor.'' He quoted <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> as saying the senators would convince their `` friend'' to make more home loans if the regulation was withdrawn until after it had been tested in the courts. `` It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` It was a quid pro quo.'' The four senators, plus Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Michigan, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also have acknowledged meeting a week later with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who had been called to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to answer questions about an ongoing audit of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. All five senators have been asked by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to explain in detail their presence at the two April 1987 meetings, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has begun no formal investigation. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, said his boss and the three other senators have consistently taken issue with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s description of the meeting `` There were five people in that room _ <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and the four senators,'' he said, `` and all four senators have said on the record that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is totally and completely inaccurate.'' But <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said a claim that he `` fabricated such a yarn ... simply is not credible.'' `` The fact that this meeting became public knowledge has deeply embarrassed these senators,'' he testified. `` They have every reason in the world to deny what Sen. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> offered me in that meeting because he was, evidently, speaking on their behalf.'' His testimony came in the fourth of a series of hearings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on why regulators waited two years after bank board examiners concluded that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was acting in an unsafe and unsound manner before seizing control of it. Federal regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> last April and said they could have to pay up to $ 2 billion to depositors whose federally insured savings were lost through <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s risky investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to clean up the thrift industry mess, filed a $ 1.1 billion suit in September against <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, alleging fraud and racketeering. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who has said he arranged several millions of dollars in contributions to members of both political parties this decade, purchased the 29-branch <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in 1984. He also had been scheduled to testify Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel but his appearance was postponed for two weeks at the request of his attorneys. Another witness Tuesday, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON>, refused to answer any questions, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutional right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> was in charge of auditing <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and wrote nearly identical letters to <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> and <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> that March supporting assertions by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s officials that it was being harassed by bank board examiners. Shortly afterward, according to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, D-Tex., <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> resigned from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and took a $ 900,000-a-year job with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is chaired by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> In other testimony Tuesday: _ Former <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L Commissioner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> acknowledged that four weeks before leaving his job at the end of 1984, he approved a change in state regulations that allowed <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to make $ 900 million in direct investments that would have been forbidden by a new federal policy While still in office, <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> was listed in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as a board member of <ORGANIZATION> TCS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> investment consulting firm that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> bankrolled in January 1985 with a $ 2.89 million purchase of stock. _ Former <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Member </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION>, who had more than $ 2 million in loans from <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> when named to the board in 1986, testified that he recused himself from all decisions involving <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> during his five-month term He denied allegations by <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and others that his proposal at his first board meeting to `` grandfather'' exclusions for direct investments prior to December 1984 from the regulation was at <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s behest. `` I had no idea at the board what was going on at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding that he had no conversations with <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> or any of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s representatives before drafting it.

<HEAD>Federal Grant to AIDS Art Show Under Scrutiny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 10,000 federal grant for an AIDS art show that includes homosexual images is being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> as a possible violation of a new anti-obscenity statute. The NEA grant to Artists Space, a private, non-profit arts institution in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is the subject of week-long negotiations between arts endowment chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, the gallery's executive director. The issue was discussed Tuesday by board members of the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> gallery, but Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> refused to say whether any decisions were made. She and <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> refused to discuss details of the negotiations, but <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said he believed the matter would be resolved later this week. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s tax-paid grant was awarded to Artists Space last July, before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation inspired by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that forbids federal support for artworks that `` may be considered obscene'' by the arts endowment chairman. The endowment can not force the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gallery to return the $ 10,000 in taxpayer funds. But <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview the endowment's options include formally disavowing its support for the AIDS show and persuading the gallery to refund the money voluntarily. Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said she alerted <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> to the content of the show because she was concerned that <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> `` might not particularly like this artwork,'' and she wanted to make the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> aware of a potential controversy involving one of its grants. Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the $ 30,000 exhibition includes images of gay sexuality among the works by 23 painters, sculptors and photographers that depict the emotional and spiritual effects of AIDS on the artistic community. The show is scheduled to open at Artists Space on Nov. 16. `` There is male nudity in the show, but I do n't consider that necessarily homoerotic,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. `` There is also female nudity, but no one has said anything about that.'' It was the first time <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> has wrestled with the legal implications of the anti-obscenity law regarding a specific NEA grant recipient. The law, enacted last month, expressly forbids spending tax money on `` depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts'' and any other works that lack serious artistic or literary value. The congressional ban was prompted by a controversy over $ 45,000 worth of <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> grants to contemporary art institutes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that supported works by photographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> and artist <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other conservative lawmakers criticized some of their pictures as highly offensive, and sought to restrict the arts endowment's grant-making authority. A touring exhibition of <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>'s work, which was canceled in June by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, included homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and pictures of nude children. <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was criticized for a photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine. The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 10,000 to Artists Space for the AIDS show before the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> legislation was approved last month as part of the endowment's $ 171 million appropriation for the current fiscal year. The endowment, an independent federal agency, awarded $ 156 million in matching grants last year to about 800 individual artists and 3,800 arts institutions. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> told a weekend meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, a presidentially appointed body that advises the arts endowment, the new law is `` extremely difficult to interpret'' and is being implemented with caution.

The report released Tuesday showed airlines with their best on-time performance since April and showed a decrease in the number of mishandled baggage complaints against airlines but a slight increase in other complaints. The data for September showed the 12 largest carriers reported 79.6 percent of their flights operated on time, an improvement over the 74.6 percent that operated on time in August and the best record since April's 83.4 percent. Mishandled baggage complaints filed against carriers averaged 7.25 reports per 1,000 passengers in September, compared to 8.19 in August, the report said. Consumer complaints, the only category for which October figures are available, increased from 1,104 in September to 1,143 in October.

<HEAD>Thousands of Hazardous Waste Sites Fail to Make Cleanup Lists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of dangerous waste dumps never make the Superfund list or any other federal roster of toxic sites, according to testimony at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel hearing. The list is incomplete because the way <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> gathers information and evaluates sites is seriously flawed, says the Office of Technology Assessment. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says the list is arbitrary and up to 425,000 sites have yet to be put on any kind of federal list despite potential harm to the environment. The two congressional research services presented their findings Tuesday at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. `` Many sites never enter the Superfund program because they fail to be discovered or are discovered but are not entered into the inventory of potential cleanup sites,'' <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources He said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> relies on information supplied it, from state and local governments for example, rather than devising ways to seek out data on hazardous waste sites. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also is ruling out too many sites from Superfund consideration too early in the review stage to have a firm handle on their potential harm, <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is sacrificing an objective review of Superfund sites to the bureaucratic need to manage its caseloads. A report released last month by <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON>'s office estimates the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> may have rejected as many as 2,000 sites for Superfund consideration. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it could not challenge the figures because it did not know how they were compiled, but it defended its early screening process. `` Yes, we've processed more, but we've made better decisions,'' replied <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Longest </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> and Remedial Response. The nearly 10-year-old Superfund program has resulted in the full cleanup of 38 of 1,200 sites deemed to need immediate federal attention, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between 130,000 and 425,000 sites may eventually have to be evaluated for possible cleanup action, a burden that will fall mostly on the states. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimated last year that a Superfund cleanup costs on the average $ 21 million to $ 30 million. A <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report released at the hearing said the evaluation of sites for Superfund depends on an arbitrary numerical rating, adding that a number of sites coming close to that cutoff score pose real hazards even though they do n't make the list.

<TEXT>
 A 25-year-old <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> wildlife artist is the winner of this year's government Duck Stamp competition, besting more than 600 other entrants for the award. A panel of judges on Tuesday selected an acrylic painting of two black-bellied whistling ducks in flight by artist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, as its choice for the next Duck Stamp, covering the 1990-91 hunting season. The federal stamps, which also are purchased widely by collectors, must be bought for licenses to hunt waterfowl. The contest is perhaps the most prestigious in area of wildlife art. <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON> also could earn as much as $ 1 million from commercial printings and other royalties, although the government pays no money for use of the painting. Five judges selected <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON>, who had entered the Duck Stamp competition four previous times, after they sifted through the works of 603 artists during two days of judging at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s auditorium. More than a million of the stamps with <PERSON> Hautman </PERSON>'s design will be sold for the waterfowl hunting season, bringing $ 12.50 apiece to the government. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received more than $ 13 million from the sale of the stamps. Although the government sold nearly 1.4 million stamps last year, the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years. About 2.4 million stamps were sold annually in the early 1970s.

<TEXT>
 Legislation to strictly control auto emissions is advancing in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, but faces future battles when the full chamber debates the major initiative to clean the nation's skies The auto exhaust language won a razor-thin 7-6 victory Tuesday in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, after <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> refused a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> request to delay a vote while alternatives were considered. The vote was along party lines, although future debate would be more likely to find divisions between supporters and critics of the auto industry. The industry and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language, which will now move from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> to the full committee _ probably next week after the panel debates acid rain provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would impose tough exhaust standards, now required in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, starting in 1993 and require a second round of reductions in 2003 that would be 50 percent stricter than the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> requirements. A rival <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would only impose a second round of reductions if a study showed they were necessary, achievable and cost-effective. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for air programs, said `` it makes a lot of sense'' to substitute a plan that would let automakers choose how to cut emissions early in the next century He said the cheaper choice, saving $ 7 billion to car purchasers, would be to require automakers to build cars that can run on fuel that burns cleaner than pure gasoline. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and automakers said that going beyond the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> standards would provide only minimal pollution reductions while raising the average cost of a new car by $ 500. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the subcommittee, disputed the $ 500 figure, equating the cost of tailpipe reductions in the next century to the purchase of `` a nice new hubcap. The ranking subcommittee Republican, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, has drawn up a proposal that would let automakers choose the method of pollution reduction, but he did not introduce it. He asked instead for a delay in the vote and a hearing. <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> refused to delay, saying a postponement would prevent him from reporting a bill to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before Thanksgiving. He agreed to hold a hearing on <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>'s plan Nov. 20, but any changes would have to be proposed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, he said. The bill is not likely to be scheduled for full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate until early next year. `` We ought to look at oil companies'' to produce cleaner fuels, <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> said in support of his alternative. `` Why should they be let off the hook in doing something on clean air?'' <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> said he would support an alternative fuels proposal that would be added to the 2003 tailpipe emissions reductions, but would not support the plan as a substitute. An alternative fuels proposal was a key part of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air legislation A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee already has watered it down, and the issue will resurface before the full committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill's pollution reduction requirements for non-methane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would take effect a year earlier than those in the major clean air legislation approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.

I'd be perfectly prepared to do it, but I was elected,'' the president asserted And why argue with success? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference on Tuesday: `` I put confidence in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ their ability to sort through what is fair and what is unfair, what is ugly and what is un-ugly, and be as positive as possible.'' Anyway, negative campaigning, like un-ugliness, may be in the eye of the beholder, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested. `` What some consider negative, others consider factual,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wasasked his views on the negative campaigning that marked this year's gubernatorial races in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the mayoral race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ tactics that might have been borrowed, after all, from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own 1988 campaign playbook. `` I think everybody would prefer the positives ... But I'm not sure there is much that a president can do about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reflected. He said candidates must be permitted to get their message across in their own way, and that any restrictions on that message would amount to censorship. Still, he continued, `` Maybe I can have a role in seeing that it gets a little more positive.'' The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> races included negative campaigning _ largely from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> side in the final days of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> race, and with both candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> comparing each other to a lying Pinocchio, complete with growing noses. Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> claimed victory over Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s gubernatorial race, while Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> easily defeated Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relied heavily on negative campaigning in 1988 _ from his frequent attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' patriotism to the constant airing of ads on the rape of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman by convicted murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> while on a weekend furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison. In the concluding weeks of last year's race, then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would vow on one day to wage a gentler, kinder campaign. Then, the very next, he would attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> who would torpedo prosperity and bring gloom and malaise upon <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Sometimes he'd voice positive lofty themes in a morning appearance, then breathe fire later in the day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign ads, in addition to dramatizing abuses of the prison furlough program that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> oversaw as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, ridiculed his rival's ride in an Army tank and appeared to equate his veto of a pledge of allegiance bill to disrespect for the flag. One of the chief architects of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack campaigning, media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, resurfaced this year in the GOP <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral campaign of <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> _ as did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 political strategist, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned this fall for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The president said Tuesday he still has `` great confidence'' that Americans made the right decision one year ago. `` I think they sorted through some of the allegations that this was the ugliest, dirtiest campaign. And I think they voted on a more positive basis,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated a view expressed often during the 1988 campaign by his campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, now the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics were rife with negative campaigning from the very beginning. `` I do n't say anything started in 1988 that had n't been taking place in'86 or'82 or'80,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You know, if you look into history, you're going to have certain things that are considered negative.'' `` I think it ought to be a little more positive ... -LRB- But -RRB- what else can you do?'' he asked. `` I'm certainly not going to legislate it.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftists Demand Prosecution In Death-Squad Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After three of its members were kidnapped, tortured and shot to death, a leftist political party blamed military men and demanded that the local army commander turn them in for civilian prosecution. The slaying of the young activists of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, discovered Tuesday, comes a week after 10 people were killed in the bombing of a leftist labor union's downtown headquarters. Leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents, which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10-year-old civil war. There are widespread fears that rightist death squads are again on the prowl after lying low for four years. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said military men dressed in civilian clothes seized the three party members Monday night after a meeting in <LOCATION> Sonsonate </LOCATION>, a provincial capital 40 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The victims were found dumped on <PERSON> Sonsonate </PERSON>'s outskirts Tuesday evening bearing all the hallmarks of the death squads: they had been tortured, shot repeatedly, and a hand-lettered sign nearby said they were `` executed'' because they `` betrayed the fatherland,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> sad. He said in a telephone interview that the party is demanding that Sonsonate military commander Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> turn the soldiers involved over to civilian judicial authorities. `` We hold those military officials ... responsible,'' he said. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> identified one of the victims as <PERSON> Cecilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the movement's Sonsonate coordinator. He did not have <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s age or the names and ages of the other two, he said, because of poor telephone communications. Local judicial authorities ordered the three buried as unidentified corpses shortly after they were found, but <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said party members were able to see the bodies and identified them. The slayings, a recent wave of bombings and other attacks have threatened to scuttle negotiations for a cease-fire in the civil war and to force leftist political groups back underground. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders ordered all party offices and halls temporarily closed Tuesday because they did not want more members killed. `` The authorities are threatening us, they do not let us operate,'' he said. Most of the more than 70,000 people killed in the civil war were civilians slain by the right-wing death squads from 1979 to 1984 on suspicion of being leftists, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and human rights groups. Death squad activity dropped sharply in mid-1984 with the election of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, but attacks on leftists picked up when rightist President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> took office June 1 for a five-year term. Leftist leaders accuse <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, of links to the death squads, which have enlisted off-duty military and security agents. They blame the military for bomb attacks Oct. 31 on the National Workers' Federation, or Fenastras, and Comadres, an organization of relatives of political prisoners and people who have disappeared in the war. The attacks killed 10 people and injured 33. Leaders of Fenastras and Comadres say the bombings were in retaliation for a mortar attack the previous day by leftist rebels on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> compound that killed one civilian and wounded 15. On Oct. 19, a bomb exploded at the home of <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader, but no one was hurt. The movement was created in 1980 by dissidents who broke away from <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a political coalition allied with the guerrillas. He returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> two years ago from exile after the <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> government promised an end to repression. To protest the Oct. 31 attacks, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> canceled its participation in a third round of cease-fire negotiations with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s representatives set for Nov. 20-21 in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Earlier meetings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> resulted in deadlock, but the two sides pledged to continue meeting at 30-day intervals until they could agree on some kind of a truce.

<HEAD>Customs Says Problems With Radar Planes Investigated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says it's investigating `` everything from safety concerns'' to possible management coverup of problems at the agency's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> surveillance center, where sophisticated radar planes are launched to locate drug-smuggling aircraft <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for internal affairs, said the investigation followed `` a lot of complaints'' about management of the Surveillance Support Center in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, where the high-tech P-3 airborne early warning -LRB- AEW -RRB- planes are based. Customs Service documents on the planes, most written by crewmen, say the aircraft have serious electronic problems that have diminished their ability to locate drug-ferrying aircraft and guide other Customs planes pursuing the suspects. The internal affairs investigation could be joined by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> probe. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., a <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who has conducted numerous hearings on Customs air operations, said Tuesday he asked Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich. to hold hearings on the `` We've got to get to the bottom of this,'' said English, who was instrumental in getting Customs the $ 27 million for its first P-3 AEW that arrived in June 1988; and more than $ 30 million for the second <ORGANIZATION> AEW </ORGANIZATION>, delivered last April. Funding has been approved for a third of the four-engine turboprops outfitted especially for the drug war by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Customs investigation involves `` everything from safety concerns ... to management being aware of problems and not taking appropriate actions,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said the investigation could touch other centers in Customs' air operations, which launch interceptor and pursuit aircraft <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed the agency's own investigation `` has been going on for about four weeks. Internal affairs has not talked to anyone in management. We encourage any investigations, whether from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or internal affairs.'' Asked about allegations of a coverup, <PERSON> Kendig </PERSON> said, `` There has never been any intention by management to gloss over problems'' that appeared `` in any official documents. All problems have been identified and have been resolved or are being resolved.'' One Customs source, speaking only on condition he not be named, offered a different picture, saying problems documented in staff memos `` were never reflected in any reports to headquarters. ... We're still living with the same problems 15 months down the road'' from the arrival of the first P-3 AEW. The Surveillance Support Center operates seven detection aircraft, with the two airborne early warning planes featuring state-of-the-art equipment that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> says outperforms <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military surveillance planes. The AEW computer systems and graphic displays are designed to locate plans the government estimates carry about half the cocaine reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Deficiencies noted in the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> documents have included a computer system that has trouble locating and tracking smugglers; faulty on-board communications for the crew, and a problem with a spinning, metal radar dome. Some reports critical of the performance of the aircraft were ordered rewritten by an agency supervisor to stress success and not failures, according to the documents and Customs sources.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters rejected a pay raise for state lawmakers by a 2-to-1 margin Tuesday, and smoking curbs in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the heart of tobacco-land, were approved by the narrowest of margins. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> approved a sweeping charter change that makes its government more representative. In <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, where the tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, employs 2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered voters smoke, limits on smoking in some public places were approved by 173 votes out of 29,809 votes cast. With all 45 precincts reporting unofficials tallies, there were 14,991 votes for the curbs and 14,818 against them. The proposal would ban smoking in elevators and in certain stores. Smoking limits would also require restaurants seating more than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with 3,880 of 6,621 precincts reporting, the proposal to triple the current $ 7,200 salary of state lawmakers to $ 23,300 had 387,898 no votes, or 69 percent, to 174,365 yes votes, or 32 percent. A proposal to boost the expense allowance from $ 30 to $ 81 was also rejected by 57 percent to 43 percent. But Texans were favoring the dropping of a 113-year-old provision requiring state office-holders to swear they did n't bribe their way into their positions. Voting was 373,192 votes, or 67 percent, in favor of dropping it and 184,968 votes, or 33 percent, against dropping it. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ballot had 21 propositions. A $ 500 million water measure to bring running water and sewers to disease-ridden border towns was approved by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin, and a proposal to spend $ 400 million on new prisons to ease overcrowding was being approved by a 66 percent to 34 percent margin. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> voters approved a charter change giving the mayor more power, boosting the size of city council from 35 to 51 members and abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>. With 4,677 of 5,243 precincts reporting, the measure received 442,883 yes votes, or 56 percent, to 354,430 no votes, or 44 percent. The city is under order by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to make its legislature more representative. Taxes, gay rights and a new baseball stadium to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> in quake-rattled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were among the local and statewide issues at stake Tuesday. Voters in 10 states encountered 56 statewide ballot measures. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> voters approved a quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to raise $ 98 million over the next seven years to fight the war on drugs. There were 29,464 yes votes, or 62 percent, to 17,877 no votes, or 38 percent in the city. The percentages were similar in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which encompasses <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> voters were favoring ratification of a contingency contract to dispose of low-level nuclear wastes in <LOCATION> Beatty </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and were narrowly favoring the end of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> testing of Tomahawk cruise missiles over the state. With 517 of 666 precincts reporting, the nuclear waste disposal contract was being endorsed with 85,638 yes votes, or 54 percent, to 71,735 no votes, or 46 percent. Opponents of missile testing maintained a slight edge. There were 84,929 votes to end testing, or 53 percent, to 76,324 votes, or 47 percent to continue testing. The referendum was non-binding. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, voters rejected two proposals that would increase the state sales tax to generate $ 400 million for schools. The measures were defeated by a better than 2-to-1 margin. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> voters also rejected a four-cent property tax increase to subsidize the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>. In another issue dealing with taxes, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> voters soundly rejected a `` Children's Initiative'' to hike the sales tax by nearly a penny per dollar to help raise at least $ 360 million a year for smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse and drug education. The measure failed by 70 percent to 30 percent. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, voters approved the spending of $ 56 million in state tax revenues in hopes of becoming the host for the Winter Olympic Games in 1998. The money is needed for ski jumps, a speed skating oval and bobsled-luge runs. With 726 of 1,134 of the precincts reporting, or 64 percent, there were 110,347 votes for, or 55 percent, and 89,045 votes against, or 45 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> won at least one victory in <LOCATION> Scottdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where voters approved $ 8.4 million to build a new stadium and keep the National League champions from moving their spring training site to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The measure received 14,340 yes votes to 5,520 against. The new stadium will hold 7,000 fans, about 1,800 more than the current park holds. The <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> have trained there since 1982. But in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, it remained unclear whether voters would approve a $ 115 million downtown stadium to replace windswept Candlestick Park, which opened in 1960 and survived the Oct. 17 earthquake with minimal damage. With 250 of 621 precincts counted, or about 40 percent of the vote, the measure was losing with 41,705 no votes to 37,558 yes votes. Owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> had threatened to move the team, possibly to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, if the measure failed. Several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities had proposals dealing with gay rights. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> voted on a `` domestic partners'' measure entitling unmarried and homosexual couples who work for the city to the same funeral and sick benefits as married couples. With 156 of 621 precincts reporting, the measure had 29,389 votes against it to 22,832 votes in favor. In affluent <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, a measure that would deny homosexuals the protection of the city's anti-discrimination ordinance was leading by a handful of votes. The measure as it stands bans discrimination based on age, sex, reglion, race, disability, marital status and sexual orientation. With 14 percent of the ballots counted, the measure to remove sexual orientation had received 1,572 yes votes, or 50.9 percent, and 1,514 no votes, or 49.1 percent. Discrimination against AIDS victims was an issue in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the first time it was on the ballot anywhere. Voters decided whether to repeal a recent ordinance protecting the rights of those with AIDS. With 20 of 52 precincts reporting, the measure to take away the rights had 5,926 yes votes to to 4,924 no votes. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, voters weighed a measure that would end forced school busing and promote educational choice.

 Inmates at a prison near the Olympic National Forest say there's something wrong with the chow. Nonsense, say prison workers: The meat's so fresh you can still see the tire marks. Some prisoners at the <ORGANIZATION> Clearwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> say they're sick of eating venison and other wild game that comes from illegal kills by hunters and occasionally from `` road kills'' by logging trucks and other vehicles. They've nicknamed such fare `` Rudy stew.'' As in <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> the Red-Nosed Reindeer. It's no rarity for inmates to gripe about the food. The difference at <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> _ a minimum-security work camp 30 miles from this logging town _ is the species they get to gripe about. Sometimes it's deer. Sometimes elk. `` These guys who come through that chow line do n't have a choice,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevard </PERSON>, an inmate and camp butcher. `` That's what it comes down to: Here's the <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> stew You eat it. If you do n't like it, right over there is the peanut butter jar.'' `` I do n't like it. I wo n't eat it. I took one bite and said, ` That's not for me,''' said inmate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who works in the kitchen and serves the fare to the 256 prisoners. He has complained about the entrees to the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bevard </PERSON> said he knows of at least one instance in which no one inspected the meat from a deer hit by a truck. But state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the road-kill game can be served and is inspected by a local medical authority and a state <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. `` It really undergoes a rigorous evaulation by the -LRB- Wildlife -RRB- Department. The game warden certifies the game as fit for human consumption,'' said <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Studer </PERSON>, the department's food service adviser. Prison staff members eat the food, too. `` There is nothing that any of us are trying to hide,'' said <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>'s superintendent, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` The real issue is whether it's illegal or not illegal to do it. From our standpoint, it is legal. Unfortunately, if it's stopped, there will be a lot of good meat gone to waste.'' Prison staff members said they are tired of hearing the inmates' bellyaching <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, kitchen staff supervisor, called <PERSON> Bevard </PERSON> a complainer, and said, `` He eats it like it's going out of style.'' She and other staffers said they like the game. If inmates do n't like the food, they said, there's always the salad bar

 The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rebounded. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 325.13 points, or 0.92 percent, ending at 35,595.59. It had lost 163.54 points the previous day. The dollar closed at 142.97 yen, down 0.66 yen from Tuesday's 143.63 yen-finish The currency opened lower at 143.00 yen, and ranged between 142.80 yen and 143.20 yen. The dollar had opened lower following its overnight decline in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The currency's decline was attributed to the move by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower the federal funds rate, a short-term interst rate in interbank transactions. Japanese investors were cautious because lowering the federal funds rate does not necessarily indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is going to lower the discount rate, the key lending rate to commercial banks, said a trader with a major Japanese commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the stock exchange, the Nikkei, the market's main barometer, started higher following an overnight gain in the Dow Jones average of 30 major industrial issues in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, dealers said. <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>' senior dealer, said Japanese participants were reassured by the gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which was encouraged by prospects that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might soon ease its monetary policy. Lower interest rates are considered an encouraging factor for stock trading. `` Construction issues were widely bought following the U.S.-Japan structural talks,'' <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said, citing the fact that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase its spending on public facilities. During the two-day U.S.-Japan economic talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials urged the Japanese to take such steps as consuming more, building more sewers, ports and express highways, and making it easier to convert farmland to housing projects.

Four other candidates shared the remainder of less than 5 percent. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> was the second <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> mayor elected to five consecutive terms. The first was <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, whose 1985 comeback bid was squelched by Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>. `` You have given me such a high honor,'' she told supporters. `` You have placed your trust in me. My goal is to live up to that trust and to make sure our community is the greatest city anywhere in the world.'' The loss snuffed a bid for a political comeback by <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>, 51, who served as mayor for two terms in the 1970s. <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>'s father was colorful <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>, the prime mover behind building of the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Astrodome. `` This is not the end of anything,'' <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON> said. `` It is the beginning of something. A tremendous number of people went to the polls with our vision of 1990. I do n't leave unhappy.'' <PERSON> Hofheinz </PERSON>' campaign assertions that Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> had run out of steam after eight years on the job never appeared to take hold, as Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> built a commanding lead in the polls and never relinquished it. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, a 43-year-old accountant, took office at the height of the oil boom, but had to deal with declining revenues and a shattered economy when oil prices collapsed. She touted her handling of city finances through the tough times and boasted that unemployment, which peaked at some 13 percent, is now around 5 percent. `` It's been a long campaign but a fun campaign,'' she said. `` We never knew exactly what to expect. We felt if we kept the campaign on a positive note, we'd win, and that's what we've done. I think there was a log of mudslinging but I'm ready to put that behind us.''

 Fans blew kisses at the open casket of pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, and his widow said he was playing as well as ever at the end. `` He was still playing so beautifully,'' <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said Tuesday outside the funeral house where her husband's body was on public view. `` He was everything in my life. We had some wonderful times and some very sad times together.'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who emigrated from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1925 and won international acclaim for his thunderous, volatile command of the piano, died Sunday of a heart attack at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home. He was 85.

<HEAD>Congressional Plan Would Toughen Sanctions on China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agreement between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also consents to would toughen trade sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in response to last summer's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators A compromise reached Tuesday on a measure authorizing activities of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies included penalties on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that go beyond those imposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre in June. The sanctions included suspension of risk insurance through the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for companies doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; suspension of trade assistance; a freeze on exports of satellites; a halt to sales of controlled munitions, including helicopters and parts, and crime control equipment; and an end to sale of certain nuclear material and components. The measure harshly condemned the `` unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on the thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 4, noting that at least 700 people died and another 27 or more were executed afterward. The bill also condemned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts to conceal the truth of what happened, including clandestine disposal of bodies and suppression of news reports. The sanctions and the verbal condemnation were included in the compromise version of a two-year, $ 9.7 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill, which now goes back to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for final approval. The measure was initially opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of the sanctions, but was later accepted after Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, agreed to make it easier for the president to waive the penalties. In discussions with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said, the measure was altered to allow termination of the sanctions if the president certifies such action is `` in the national interest.'' Scowcroft reported the president would not veto the measure based on that provision, said <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>. The conferees also accepted a section that would impose criminal penalties on any government official who enlists any foreign government to carry out policies that are banned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The amendment grew out of the Iran-Contra affair. It was intended to bar use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid as leverage with countries to support goals the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not pursue directly because of legal restrictions. It is aimed at situations like the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to pressure that government to support the Contra rebels fighting the government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. That provision could still provide a reason for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the bill. The overall measure includes major boosts in aid for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. They would be authorized to receive a total of $ 832 million this year and $ 939 million next year, compared with $ 520 million last year.

<HEAD>UN Sending 625-Member Border Patrol Force to Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a month of delay during which 2,000 Contras slipped into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is taking the unprecedented step of sending peacekeepers to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to stop the border crossings. Another mission for the 625-strong border patrol force will be to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are being made to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Sandinista officials are to meet Contra leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Thursday and Friday for talks mediated by a joint U.N.-Organization of American States commission. Honduran officials will sit in as observers. The Contras are insisting on reinstatement of the 19-month cease-fire with the government. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> suspended the unilateral truce last week, citing mounting rebel raids he said were aimed at disrupting national elections set for Feb. 25. The Contra attacks violate an Aug. 7 agreement by five Central American presidents under which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> promised the free elections in exchange for the demobilization of the Contras by early December. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says about 2,000 Contras infiltrated <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in recent weeks, and that now about 4,000 are in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and 10,000 remain in their bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ceased arming the Contras in February 1988 but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has continued to supply them with non-lethal eaid. The border patrol force is the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force to be deployed in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acceptance of it marks a reverse by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Earlier this year, then-U.S. ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> opposed such a force and <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said when she was ambassador that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers would never have a role in Central America. Deployment of the force had been delayed for weeks by the failure of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to adopt a clear policy. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking privately, said Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> had won political support for the force, but it took longer to persuade <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that the $ 41 million cost for six months was worthwhile. Other officials said there was a split in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over whether the peacekeepers would interfere with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras camped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> will provide the bulk of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers, pilots and staff for the force, to be called ONUCA after the Spanish initials for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Observer Group-Central <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The force will also contain a Latin American contingent. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have agreed in principle to provide troops. ONUCA will be a highly mobile border patrol, equipped with jeeps, helicopters and speedboats. It will have 260 military observers; 115 crew members for 12 helicopters and an airplane; 50 members for a naval unit consisting of speedboats and patrol boats; 14 medical workers; about 104 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staffers for administration; and 82 locally recruited civilians. Headquarters will be in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 Abortion rights leaders say victories by their candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> prove the power of their issue and that `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should take heed.'' A spokeswoman for abortion opponents voiced displeasure with the way anti-abortion Republican candidates ran their campaigns in Tuesday's off-year elections. `` The right to choose has been proven to be a pivotal voting issue,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The abortion rights group poured money into independent expenditure campaigns in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> races for governor and was involved in selected legislative races in both states. Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> won easily in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> while supporting continued abortion rights. Democrat <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> claimed a narrow victory in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> over anti-abortion Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in a race where abortion was a dominant issue. Abortion also became an issue in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lieutenant governor's race, where little-known Democratic nominee <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> upset Republican <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> `` Eddy'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, an opponent of abortion who had aired television ads highlighting the issue and seeming to soften her opposition. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the leading anti-abortion group, faulted <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s handling of the issue `` We're frustrated that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was able to frame the debate'' on abortion, she said. She said her group did not work on behalf of <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, who sought to modify his opposition to abortion. She said the losses by <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> pointed up the risk of backing away from an anti-abortion position. `` <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> betrayed the pro-life movement in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` She used the rhetoric of the pro-abortion side. It was exactly the wrong thing to do. She lost because of it.'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>'s loss to <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> `` proves that a candidate's anti-choice position will dog them right to the end and that lying wo n't work.'' `` This is a wake-up call for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' she said, noting the president's recent veto of a bill that would permit federally financed abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest. `` The message to politicians everywhere is if you're out of touch you'll be out of office,'' she said. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should take heed.'' Among the other races where abortion was a focus was the race for <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Republican incumbent <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> won re-election a year after bolting the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in protest over that party's support for abortion rights.

The 40-year-old mayor called his landslide re-election Tuesday `` a victory that clearly shows the unity of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' But he sees a threat to that unity in former commissioner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, who earned a runoff against incumbent <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, who's black `` -LRB- <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> -RRB- has been very divisive,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` He's run a very, very ethnically tinged and characterized campaign.'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 64, had 13,150 votes, or 38 percent, to 12,459 votes, or 36 percent, for former commissioner <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON>, 34, in a six-candidate field. <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> said he would appeal to all groups and rejected suggestions that blacks _ 30 percent of the city's voters _ should be assured of keeping a black representative on the commission. `` The American way is not that you assign any seat to black or white or Cuban,'' <PERSON> Carollo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> said: `` There is no such thing as a black seat ... But there being three ethnic groups in the community, each group should have a representative. We will not have a divisive campaign.'' A runoff also will be held next week for the other commission seat up for grabs. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who resigned the position this summer to run unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was second in a six-candidate field with 10,044 votes, or 29.2 percent, to educator <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>'s 10,279 votes, or 29.9 percent Both are Cuban-born.

<HEAD>Soviet Magazine Editor Says Glasnost Won't be Stifled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A trailblazing Soviet magazine editor who was rebuked last month by an angry President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for being too radical says the free atmosphere of glasnost has advanced too far to be reversed. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, delivered a strong response to those in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership who would seek to stifle the press for not being supportive enough of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` They'll never stop us,'' <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said Tuesday night in a speech sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, the state-controlled press was a laughingstock to its readers, <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said, and `` nobody took it seriously.'' Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of glasnost, or openness, it has enjoyed an explosion of freedom, with some publications printing frank discussions of the nation's problems. Now that people believe in the press, `` we must be honest,'' said <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, who today ended a two-week <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. `` If we lose our face now, it will be tragic,'' he said. `` It will be the most dangerous tragedy. And we must fight for the honesty. And not only for us, but for many of you and for many other countries.'' On Oct. 13, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summoned top Soviet editors, including <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, for a two-hour, closed-door lecture during which he expressed his fury at several liberal publications. He accused them of working against the party or of seeking his political downfall at a time when the country is suffering economic and ethnic problems. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said he had never seen the Soviet leader so angry. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is `` always soft, always nice, always such a very, very polite man.'' This time, however, `` he was cruel. ... It was quite a different man.'' According to <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned the editors: `` We are standing in the ocean of gasoline and you, you play with the matches.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly said <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most popular newspaper, Arguments and Facts, should resign. <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> has refused to quit, and he is still waiting to learn his fate. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, 53, said no editor is secure, including himself. `` I think it will be possible ... to fire one editor or two editors, but it will be impossible to change the atmosphere,'' he said. `` The atmosphere is very free.'' Whether from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or the more conservative factions in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> says the press criticism has been more strident. `` Now we have stronger and stronger speeches: the press is guilty. I always have those discussions with the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. They tell me sometimes that people do n't believe in our system because ` You're writing that terrible things are happening.' I tell them that people do n't believe so strongly -LRB- in the Soviet system -RRB- because they do n't have sausages in our supermarkets.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said he liked the stormy meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I think this meeting with editors was good move played by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the long and dangerous continuation -LRB- he has -RRB- usually played. It was quite a professional move, an interesting move. But I still am not afraid of him. You see, I want to play on his team,'' he said. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> agreed his progressive weekly is a weapon for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reforms, `` but I never try to be personally connected in such a way that I call <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and ask, ` What do you want from me?' Never! ... Journalism must not be personal service. I support the idea of democratic changes, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is personally connected with this idea, and I try to connect the magazine with the same idea.'' <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, a member of the Soviet legislature, also said lawmakers were drafting measures to do away with censorship and make publications such as his independent. He also said he has been discussing joint publishing ventures with several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magazines, including Reader's Digest and Life.

 The race to fill the unexpired term of the late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> will come down to a runoff between state Sen. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and City Councilman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. None of the 11 candidates in the crowded field Tuesday could attract more than 50 percent of the vote for an outright win. A spokesman in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> secretary of state's office said Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> likely would schedule the runoff in mid-December. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fell nine percentage points short of taking the seat, winning 41.4 percent of the balloting, or 27,317 votes, to <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s 34.4 percent, or 22,728 The two, both Democrats, pulled away early from a pack of nine other hopefuls. Their nearest pursuer, state Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, also a Democrat, picked up 4,937 votes, or 7.5 percent. `` Let's do it again,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Tuesday night. `` We'll have to get my voters out one more time, but we're going to win. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> vowed he would begin rallying support beginning today for the new race. `` We've got to start at 6:30 in the morning,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told supporters. Pre-election polls gave Hall the edge over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 32 percent to 24 percent, but <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> said being behind then did not trouble him. `` I did n't lose faith,'' he said. `` Those polls have a tendency to discourage people from voting and I think we ought to encourage people to vote.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said now that the other nine candidates have been eliminated from the race, the runoff can focus better on the issues. Hall and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> emerged as front-runners early in the race for one of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' most Democratic and racially mixed districts until the regular election is held in 1990. A year remains on the unexpired term of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who was killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in a remote jungle of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> while he was on a famine relief trip. Other Democrats who ran included state Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who got 3,088 votes, or 4.7 percent; attorney <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fobbs </PERSON>, 1,312 or about 2 percent; businessman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattenbach </PERSON>, 1,263 or 1.9 percent; and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Demas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 341 or 0.5 percent. Republicans in the race included attorney <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 2,118 or 3.2 percent; businessman <PERSON> Manse </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 1,071 or 1.6 percent; and education supervisor <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 1,057 or 1.6 percent. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> stockbroker <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was the Libertarian candidate and took 823 votes or 1.3 percent.

<TEXT>
 The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index rebounded sharply from the previous day's losses. The dollar closed at 142.97 yen, down 0.66 yen from Tuesday's 143.63-yen finish It opened at 143.00 yen and ranged between 142.80 yen and 143.20 yen. The dollar's decline in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its overnight downswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where investors were discouraged by a rumor that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would soon ease its monetary policy. Lower interest rates make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors. The rumor followed buying operations by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower the federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate used for interbank transactions. `` The dollar-yen rate moved little in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, as market players just could n't figure out whether they should buy or sell the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakao </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` The dollar was stuck between 142 yen and 144 yen, and it would n't go either higher or lower than that range,'' he said. An estimated $ 7.76 billion changed hands in today's trading. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> gained 325.13 points, or 0.92 percent, ending at 35,595.59. It had lost 163.54 points Tuesday. The index opened higher following gains in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, dealers said. `` The yen's strength on the foreign exchange market also helped reassure investors,'' said <PERSON> Tsuneo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market expectation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank to ease its monetary stance also encouraged Japanese investors,'' he said. The Nikkei continued to strengthen as Japanese investors bought real estate, construction and housing issues. In current U.S.-Japan trade talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives have urged <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to invest more in public facilities. An estimated 800 million shares were traded on the first section, up from Tuesday's 750 million.

 The devil-worshiping `` Night Stalker'' who murdered 13 people during a summer-long rampage that terrorized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> told the judge who sentenced him to death that Satan will avenge his execution. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, wearing his trademark black sunglasses, delivered a chilling recitation before <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> ordered death in the gas chamber at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>. `` You do n't understand me,'' the 29-year-old <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told the crowded courtroom Tuesday. `` You are not expected to ... I am beyond your experience. I am beyond good and evil ... I will be avenged. <PERSON> Lucifer </PERSON> dwells within us all.'' A jury on Sept. 20 convicted him of 13 murders and 30 other felonies in the 1985 attacks. The panel later recommended the death sentence. The sentence carries an automatic appeal. No executions have been held in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in almost 25 years. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said appeals courts would face a novel issue in the case: determining the impact of the slaying of one juror during deliberations. A juror was shot to death in August by her boyfriend, who later took his own life. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> burglarized homes late at night, often murdering men in their beds before attacking women and children. Satanic symbols were left at crime scenes and surviving victim testified of being forced to swear to Satan. In one murder, a victim's eyes were gouged out. In another, a woman testified during the trial she was raped beside the body of her murdered husband. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was captured by an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> mob on Aug. 31, 1985, a day after his picture appeared in newspapers and on television and he was identified as a suspect in the crime spree. Jurors, some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to intimidate them during the trial by sneering at them, returned death penalty recommendations on each of 19 special circumstance counts. `` The jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this court has ratified that judgment,'' <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> said. As the horrific case was brought to a close, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> caused some spectators to gasp as he delivered a rambling statement. `` I do n't believe in the hypocritical, moralistic dogma of this so-called civilized society,'' he said. `` I need not look beyond this oom to see all the liars, the haters, the killers, the crooks, the paranoid cowards. Truly the trematodes of the earth -LRB- a parasitic worm -RRB- ... `` You maggots make me sick, hypocrites one and all.'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s words as `` more baloney. `` I certainly would n't want anyone to listen to what he has to say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some structure in his life,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Young Takes Unprecedented Fifth Term as Detroit Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> overcame challenges of his personal and professional conduct and coasted to an unprecedented fifth term. `` I do n't know how I can thank you enough for what you have done tonight,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told supporters late Tuesday. `` This is a great victory here in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` Once again the people of this city have proved that they are sophisticated ... They can see through any kind of propaganda and disinformation and come up with the truth.'' With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> led challenger <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> 137,466, or 56 percent, to 106,739, or 44 percent. Young, 71, led from the earliest returns, which confirmed exit polls showing him firmly in control. `` We fought, we did. But we're not going to blame anybody,'' <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> said. `` My opponent may be across the street with all the fat cats celebrating. I do n't care.'' Young told cheering crowds of supporters that they used `` the right stuff'' in returning him to office until 1993, which would give him two full decades as mayor of the nation's sixth-largest city. The non-partisan race was a somewhat more competitive rematch of the two candidates' 1985 contest. Young beat <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> by 61 percent to 39 percent then. This time, again, the overriding issue was Young's record.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials made less progress than was hoped for in their talks on indirect causes of the two countries' trade imbalance, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Only modest progress, `` far less than we had hoped for,'' was achieved in the second two-day round of new high-level talks on reducing the $ 50 billion annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallara </PERSON>. `` There was very little flexibility in the Japanese government position ... in reaching common ground on the nature of the problems, even problems which do appear to be widely recognized in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters Tuesday night. Japanese officials would not be quoted by name. One from the Gaimusho, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign ministry, said his country was concerned about many of the issues raised by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side but progress could not be expected overnight. In addition to modernizing business practices, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side has asked <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to consume more and spend more on such infrastructure as roads, sewers and housing. There is no question about the need for housing and roads but the solution is complicated by the shortage of land and the world's highest land prices, the Japanese official said `` We were a little disappointed that we did n't go as far as we had hoped,'' said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, a participant in the talks. Some progress was made, `` but we would have hoped to have made more,'' he said. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said the third round of the talks would be in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in mid-January, shortly before Japanese parliamentary elections. `` I would expect there to be very intense discussions ... immediately after the -LRB- Japanese -RRB- election,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> added. Despite slow progress, he predicted that the target would be met of an early spring interim report on structural changes that could help ease the trade imbalance. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in May announced the SII, or Structural Impediment Initiative, to identify problems contributing to the trade problem stemming from lifestyles, traditions and business practices rather than formal market barriers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side has been warning that lack of concrete results could bring new pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next year to restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import of Japanese goods.

 Powerful thunderstorms sent up to 16 inches of rain sluicing through streets and bayous, flooding homes, stranding schoolchilden and killing a toddler who swept away in a drainage canal. Flood waters were receding early today in most areas drenched by the 24-hour deluge. A 70 percent chance of thunderstorms was forecast for today, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did n't issue flood warnings. As much as 16 inches of rain fell in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, next to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, from Monday night through Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. Ten inches was measured at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` If it rains long enough and hard enough, as the Bible tells us, everybody is susceptible to flooding,'' said <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Yenni </PERSON>. The weather service said 7 inches of rain fell on <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, 75 miles to the north, but dry ground quickly absorbed much of the water. The downpour overcame efforts to use huge pumps in <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> parishs to suck water out of the bowl-shaped area and into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't prepare for the amounts of water we had,'' <PERSON> Yenni </PERSON> said. `` We're still trying to prepare for 5 inches of rain in five hours. We had one drainage station measure 10 inches.'' Two-year-old <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Metairie </LOCATION> wandered out of his house and either fell or jumped into a drainage canal, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>.

Lightning knocked out transformers and switches, blacking out 11,000 customers in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area, utility officials said. Most of the electricity was restored. Many students were kept at schools into the night because of traffic snarls and the dangers of travel. At least 150 homes in <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> parishes were flooded, an experience most owners in low-lying <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> had been through before. `` I lost everything _ all my Christmas presents that I had purchased so far.

 Pulitzer vs. Pulitzer, the high-society divorce case that featured revelations of steamy extramarital affairs and drug abuse in exclusive <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is scheduled to return to court in January. This time, aerobics teacher <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> is taking on her ex-husband, millionaire newspaper heir <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> `` Peter'' Pulitzer, for more time with their 12-year-old twin sons. On Monday, a judge set the week of Jan. 16 for a two-day trial. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> is seeking more than the 70 days a year she was awarded with Mac and <PERSON> Zac </PERSON>. In December 1982, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> ruled she was unfit to be a mother, and gave custody to the father after the 18-day trial that included allegations of lesbianism, cocaine use and her sleeping with a trumpet to communicate with the spirit world. `` I have mixed emotions about the courts,'' she said Tuesday. `` -LRB- But -RRB- one must do what one must do for their children.'' Attorneys for both parents went to court Monday to discuss the trial and ask a judge to appoint a mediator. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, grandson of publishing magnate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, made it clear in a four-page response filed in court last month that he would fight his former wife's bid. He claimed his ex-wife's nude photographs in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, talk-show publicity, a television movie and her best-selling book make her unfit to spend more time with their sons. `` The former wife has seen fit to display herself nude for the entire population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and perhaps the world,'' <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> wrote of the Playboy spread several years ago. `` -LRB- Her -RRB- first and foremost interest is money,'' his lawyer added. <PERSON> Roxanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> denied the new dispute was about publicity. `` The last time, the press got involved when it should n't have,'' she said. Her attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, said none of her actions should have anything to do with her fitness to spend more time with her children. The twins moved with their father from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to a ranch in <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> three years ago.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> residents soundly thumped two school financing proposals that would have raised sales taxes to pay for education improvements. The results in Tuesday's election marked the latest in a series of defeats for school levies, with five earlier issues falling since 1972.

Proposal A, backed by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, would have increased the state sales tax from 4 percent to 4.5 percent. Proposal B would have raised the sales tax to 6 percent while cutting property taxes. Voters could choose one, both or neither of the proposals.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo resigned Wednesday at the request of the country's new Communist leader, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The resignation of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s top leaders came one day after the 44-member Cabinet handed in its resignation in response to a mass movement by the people for free elections and speech and unrestricted travel abroad. In a brief dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, who on Oct. 18 replaced longtime leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, `` suggested'' the Politburo resignation `` so that the responsibility for the current situation can be made clear.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said nothing about any change in the status of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, who is both <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and the nation's president. Eight seats on the 21-member Politburo were already vacant before Wednesday's resignation. The turmoil in the leadership comes as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> loses thousands of young workers a day to emigration and as citizens by the hundreds of thousand take to the streets nearly to protest the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political monopoly.

 Sponsors of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s bid for the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, elated by voter approval of a multimillion-dollar sports building project, say it's time to prepare to `` have the world come here.''

<TEXT>
 Voters approved a new city charter that gives more power to the mayor and an expanded <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the most sweeping overhaul of the municipal government since the five-borough city was formed in 1898. The charter that passed Tuesday would wipe out the powerful, eight-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> and transfer most of its powers to the mayor and a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> enlarged from 35 to 51 members. With 99 percent of the 5,243 precincts reporting, the vote was 493,853, or 55 percent, for Proposal 2, which encompassed most of the changes, and 410,249, or 45 percent, against. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the commission that drafted the charter, said it would provide `` a more democratic government, a government people can understand and a more efficient government.'' Before the new charter can go into effect, it must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which under the federal Voting Rights Act is charged with deciding whether local governmental changes would diminish minority political power. The department should rule in December. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in March that the city's current form of government _ specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> _ was unconstitutional. Created shortly after the boroughs consolidated into one city, the board has broad authority over contracts and planning, and approves the annual budget. It consists of the five borough presidents, who have one vote each, and the three officials elected citywide _ the mayor, comptroller and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president _ who have two votes each. Since the boroughs have widely disparate populations _ from 350,000 in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s 2.2 million _ the high court ruled that allowing them one vote each on the board violated the principle of one-person, one-vote. There were conflicting impressions citywide whether the board would end up improving or diminishing the influence of selected boroughs and their ethnic populations. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the city's least populated borough, was the one clear loser; some of its residents have formed a Secessionist party to consider leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The borough's residents, however, ousted incumbent borough President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>, who was a strong opponent of the new charter, running both as a Democrat and a Secessionist. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>, said, `` I think that I can work very well with the new charter.'' If the charter is accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, budget authority would pass to the City Council in January, and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> would disappear in September.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Fed Action Expected to Result in Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most commercial banks are likely to cut short-term interest rates in response to steps taken over the past two days by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> officials, according to a published report. Financial analysts predict the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> action means that most banks are likely to cut their 10.5 percent prime lending rate to 10 percent, probably before the end of the week, according to today's editions of The Washington Post Sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the decision to cut short-term rates was made Monday during a telephone conference call meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s top policymaking group, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Later that day, the nation's central bank began to supply extra cash to the banking system and followed Tuesday with a similar move, the newspaper said. Those actions resulted in the federal funds rate being lowered from 8.75 percent to just over 8.5 percent, the paper said. The federal funds rate is the interest rate financial institutions charge one another on overnight loans. Its level broadly determines most other short-term interest rates. The drop in the federal funds rate is the fifth since the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began to loosen its control on credit at the end of May, which marked the reversal of a yearlong effort to hold down inflation by slowing growth. The most recent previous cut came last month after a sharp drop in the stock market. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that in Monday's decision, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials were responding to recent statistics that have convinced many economists that growth will drop to the 1 percent or 2 percent range by early next year, the lowest since 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did not announce its decision and a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on whether the central bank had changed its policy, the newspaper said.

 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> voters endorsed a ban on cruise missile flights over the state and backers of the voter initiative pledged to take their fight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make the non-binding expression of sentiment stick. Tuesday's vote was `` a first step toward stopping the cruise missile tests,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, campaign manager for the anti-missile forces. With 587 of 666 precincts reporting, opponents of missile testing led by 104,281 to 94,776, or 52 percent to 48 percent.

Test ban backers object to nuclear weapons on moral and economic grounds.

<HEAD>Texas Voters Reject Raise for Lawmakers; Reforms Urged</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders said defeat of a pay raise for lawmakers does n't mean Texans are demanding ethics reform, but others in and out of government say that's exactly what the voters meant `` The defeat of Proposition 1 shows that Texans want reform before raises,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of the government watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>. In final unofficial returns, the pay-raising Proposition 1 was defeated by nearly 2-to-1. Lawmakers had sought to more than triple their pay, from $ 7,200 a year to $ 23,300, and to eliminate the need for voter approval of future raises. But several lawmakers and activists said revelations that lobbyists spent nearly $ 2 million this year to entertain legislators _ along with tricky ballot wording _ doomed the amendment. `` It's a good thing there was n't a ballot alternative that said legislators' pay should be lowered,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The pay raise _ and its companion Proposition 11 to raise lawmakers' daily expense allowance from $ 30 to $ 81 _ were the only losers among the 21 constitutional amendments on Tuesday's ballot. Voters aproved a referendum to remove from the oath of office taken by public officials the denial that they bribed anyone. Officials still would be required to sign a written statement swearing that they did n't bribe anybody. Among other proposals approved by voters: A $ 500 million water bond issue that will provide $ 100 million to put running water and sewers in the developments called `` colonias'' along the <LOCATION> Texas-Mexico </LOCATION> border.

<HEAD>Voters Reject Tax Hike for Children in Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters statewide overwhelmingly rejected an initiative that would have raised $ 360 million for children's programs Called the Children's Initiative, it won only 33 percent of Tuesday's vote with 91 percent of precincts reporting. Opponents said the measure was vague, would hurt working families through a tax increase, and amounted to a blank check for bureaucrats. `` I am really stunned it was such a big landslide victory,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickels </PERSON>, head of Mothers' Campaign for Family, the opposition's point group. `` That tells me the taxpayers of the state, who have been generous in the past with their tax dollars, are tired of their money being wasted.'' Backers, including Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, said the money was needed for smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse and drug education, as well as family services. The money would have been divided equally between children's services and schools. `` It's always difficult to pass a tax increase,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVeque </PERSON>, initiative campaign chairman. If passed, the initiative would have required the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to raise the money in the next fiscal year. The measure could have increased King County's sales tax to 9 percent. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> voters have never passed a general tax hike, although they approved a state income tax in 1932 that later was thrown out by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 The dollar eased in quiet European trading late this morning and currency dealers said the market was waiting to see whether key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would fall. Gold prices were higher, but off their overnight peaks. Dealers said Thursday's scheduled release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price figures for October could provide some clues to the direction of interest rates. A higher-than-expected figure would probably leave interest rates untouched, they said, while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> could have grounds to loosen credit policy if the figure is in line with the 0.2 percent rise analysts have predicted. The postponement of a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction Tuesday added fuel to speculation about an imminent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates, dealers said. Other dealers said the resignation of the East German government and the increasing flow of refugees out of that country into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could start casting a shadow over the Deutsche mark. `` The market is very, very nervous'' about events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a foreign exchange manager at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It's very difficult for the market to evaluate.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.66 yen to a closing 142.97 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.73 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday: _ 1.8398 West German marks, down from 1.8442 _ 1.6135 Swiss francs, down from 1.6175 _ 6.2365 French francs, down from 6.2520 _ 2.0764 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820 _ 1,344.50 Italian lire, down from 1,349.00 _ $ 1.1693 Canadian, down from $ 1.1705 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell slightly It cost $ 1.5881 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.5810 late Tuesday.

 A small <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> research and recovery submarine carrying a crew of three broke free early today after being entangled in cables for nine hours under nearly 1,300 feet of water, officials said. `` It broke free and is ascending to surface,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON>, a public affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know how.'' The crewmen inside the Deep Submerged Vehicle Turtle, as the vessel is known, had a three-day supply of air and were never in any danger, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Schamp </PERSON> said. Thier names were n't immediately available. `` They are fine,'' <PERSON> Schamp </PERSON> said. The 26-foot-long submersible, which weighs 24 tons, became entangled about 4:15 p.m. Tuesday while conducting maintenance on an underwater sonar array in <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispino </PERSON>. A pair of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels that were headed for the area where the submersible was trapped off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, apparently wo n't be needed, <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> said. The ships were carrying an unmmanned vehicle with cable cutters to free the submersible. Also aboard was a manned rescue vehicle, the Avalon, which would have been used to rescue the trapped crewmen if the unmmanned vessel had been unable to untangle it, she said. The trapped vessel's mother ship, the <LOCATION> Choueste </LOCATION>, remained in the area throughout the ordeal. Its officers were able to communicate with the three crewmen by underwater phone.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was under observation today in an intensive care unit for nausea and dizziness, but officials declined to reveal details of her illness. The wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was feeling `` very poorly'' and wanted little else revealed to the public, said Dr. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, the governor's personal physician. `` Kitty does n't want to discuss any more about her condition,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said at a Tuesday night news conference. `` We do n't want to say any more.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52, underwent four weeks of treatment for alcoholism earlier this year at a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> facility and has previously admitted she spent years addicted to diet pills. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> refused to answer questions on whether Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' illness was related to her previous alcohol and drug problems `` Although her condition has improved somewhat during the past few hours, until she feels better and has an opportunity to discuss her condition with her doctors and to fully evaluate the results of the tests ... she has asked that no further statements be made,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was taken by ambulance on Monday night to <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital. She underwent tests Tuesday, one year after the governor was defeated in his presidential bid. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> had said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was suffering flu-like symptoms. But <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> refused to say whether she was suffering influenza or whether her life had at any time been in danger. A hospital spokeswoman refused to disclose Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' condition Tuesday night <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the governor, said she would be unable to update Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' status. The governor, who spent all Tuesday at his wife's side, canceled all appointments scheduled today. <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> went to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home Monday night after Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> awoke `` feeling particularly ill'' and recommended she be taken to the hospital. `` After five days at home during which Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> experienced dizziness, headaches and severe nausea, she was admitted to the hospital ... she is continuing to experience those same symptoms'' Tuesday, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said. A year ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was admitted to a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> hospital for observation after she suffered a fever and chills one week before her husband lost his presidential bid. The Dukakises were married June 20, 1963, and have three children, one of them from Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first marriage. They live in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, a short distance from the hospital. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 86-year-old mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was in satisfactory condition at <LOCATION> Beth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she was admitted Monday after experiencing repeated fainting spells, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Veno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said the governor's mother was doing well and would likely be released from the hospital by week's end.

 <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> residents elected their first black mayor in a vote winner <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> hailed as proof the predominantly white city deserves its reputation for progressive politics. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 46, a three-term <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member, defeated his neighbor and one-time political ally, three-term City Attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> on Tuesday in an election dominated by an anti-busing school initiative. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, 43, helped draft the so-called `` Save Our Schools'' initiative, and used it as his main campaign vehicle only to watch it run out of gas. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who had announced he would not run for mayor again after losing to incumbent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> in 1985 and failing in a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, changed his mind and entered the 30 minutes before the filing deadline. He cited the anti-busing initiative as the main reason. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> 93,491 votes to 67,276 _ or 58 percent to 42 percent. The fate of the initiative was undecided with 99.9 percent of the vote counted: The count was 64,447 against, to 64,377 in favor, or 50.04 percent yes to 49.96 percent no. `` Hear me well. Hear me well,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> told cheering supporters. `` <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> can be proud of itself tonight _ proud because we're a thinking people, a thinking city and a city that cares and a city that lives up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it the most livable city in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s victory was particularly notable in light of the fact only 10 percent of the city's population is black. The <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> election was one of several that resulted in firsts for blacks. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> claimed victory as the nation's first black elected governor and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> as the first black mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The initiative asked but did not require the independently elected and self-budgeting city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to halt mandatory busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $ 4.5 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for `` magnet'' programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment. Early in the evening, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> received congratulatory telephone calls from <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. Only after <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> conceded at 11:20 p.m. PST, however, did Rice claim victory. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, a moderate Republican who once tried to form a third party, said he might have lost because of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> affiliation in the strongly liberal, Democratic city. `` Norm and I started the race as friends and we've ended the race as friends, and I look forward to supporting <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> in every way possible during his administration as mayor,'' <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, who served an unprecedented three four-year terms as mayor and is a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, has accepted the position of director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said today that more bodies were being plucked from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, bringing the known casualties from Typhoon Gay to nearly 200 dead with more than 400 still missing.

 City voters rejected a new baseball stadium for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and a `` domestic partners'' law, while suburban <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> repealed a measure that banned discrimination against people with AIDS. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who campaigned hard for the new ballpark, conceded defeat early today on the measure known as Proposition P. With all 621 precincts counted, 86,592, or 50.5 percent, voted Tuesday against it, to 84,618, or 49.4 percent, in favor. City election workers still had 2,000 to 3,000 absentee ballots to count, but <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said, `` It wo n't be enough to make a difference.'' The measure called for construction of a new stadium to replace Candlestick Park for the National League champions. Giants' owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> said the team would play at cold, windy, foggy Candlestick next year but was uncertain where the club would play in 1991. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and their fans now face an uncertain future,'' <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> said. Opponents said the new ballpark was unnecessary and untimely, considering <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s other post-earthquake needs. The measure would have committed <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to contributing $ 40 million for a waterfront stadium in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, four miles south of <LOCATION> Candlestick </LOCATION>. Expense also was an issue in Proposition S, designed to provide the same legal rights received by married couples to unmarried city workers living together as `` domestic partners.'' The measure appeared to lose, 84,060 to 82,342, with the absentee votes out. Backers said all the measure does is extend hospital visitation and bereavement leave to these couples, but opponents feared it would open the door to providing other rights and expensive services later. Voters passed a measure calling for the sale of $ 60 million in bonds for repairs from damage due to the earthquake three weeks ago. The measure passed 143,453, or 87.2 percent, to 20,995, or 12.7 percent. In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, a city of about 100,000 that is 40 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, voters passed an initiative to repeal a city council-passed ordinance banning discrimination against anyone suffering from AIDS or testing positive for the virus that causes the deadly disease. The final vote was 13,438 to 10,514. Fliers sent out before the election criticized the ordinance as giving special benefits to prostitutes, drug addicts and homosexuals _ all at high risk of contracting AIDS. Health officials, however, rallied behind the measure, saying they believed it would help slow the spread of AIDS by encouraging potential victims to seek testing, treatment and education without fear of reprisal. In the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, voters approved a measure that denies homosexuals protection under a municipal anti-discrimination ordinance, 11,482 to 10,328. The measure removes the phrase `` sexual orientation'' from <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>'s human-rights ordinance, which bans discrimination based on age, sex, religion, race, disability or marital status.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apologized to the entertainment industry for his recent criticism of American TV and movies but said <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> should forge a new code for self-censorship. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech to more than 1,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was billed as an address on the `` unfinished business'' of his presidency, but he focused instead on his comments in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last month denigrating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> film and TV productions. The former actor said Tuesday the industry should voluntarily police vulgarity and tastelessness to avoid government intervention. `` The federal government has tried to interfere too much and too often,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Censorship or restriction should be within,'' he said, suggesting voluntary standards similar to the Hays Code, which held sway through the 1950s. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was appalled by what he sees in movies and on television. `` You can call me a blockhead or a prude if you want, but ... if I was offered a script and told I had to say those words I would have turned down the script,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that he supported <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm not too proud of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> these days with the immorality that is shown in pictures and the vulgarity,'' he said in a TV interview broadcast Oct. 25 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` I just have a feeling that maybe <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> needs some outsiders to bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being made.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began his speech Tuesday with his apology. `` I'm sorry I was a little tardy in getting here today,'' he said. `` You see, my dentist was running late. He had a little difficulty in removing from my mouth the last piece of shoe leather I acquired in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad he did, though. Otherwise I would n't be able to enjoy this wonderful lunch _ there's nothing like crow souffle followed by humble pie.'' The former president also defended the $ 2 million a Japanese company paid him for a series of appearances. `` That's what was offered and I did n't protest. ... I just thought that in 16 years I had n't made any kind of money,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said.

 A woman let an unwed teen-ager and reluctant mother-to-be enter a hospital under her name to give birth, then claimed the newborn as her own, police said. Police said they had not decided whether to bring charges against the women, whose identities were not released. `` It was not a plot for money or anything. It was just one woman wanted the baby and the other did n't. It was just a dumb way to go about it,'' Detective <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said Tuesday. The ruse was discovered because the infant's mother `` told too many people'' and `` the lies she told finally caught up with her,'' <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said. The baby was born Sept. 22 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Police began investigating last Wednesday, and two days later, the infant's would-be mother turned the child over to authorities. The infant is in foster care. The 29-year-old <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> woman who pretended to be the child's mother has children of her own and `` just felt very sorry for the baby,'' <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said `` She heard about the system where babies go unwanted.'' The woman had heard through a mutual friend of the 18-year-old Derby teen-ager's desire to give up her child, police said. Police said the woman pretended to be pregnant so people would believe the baby was hers. Neither the hospital nor the woman's doctor was aware the new mother had assumed another woman's identity and insurance documents, police said. The teen-ager also assumed the older woman's identity during a prenatal visit in her eighth month of pregnancy, <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said. The child's mother, whose whereabouts remained unknown Tuesday, could face charges of abandonment, criminal impersonation and forgery, <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said. The older woman could be charged with conspiracy, the detective said. <PERSON> Osika </PERSON> said police did not know why the teen-ager did not simply put the baby up for adoption.

 A judge who said she wanted to keep a child molester from `` slinking back into the dark'' has ordered the man to buy a newspaper ad with his picture, an apology and a plea for others to get help. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Germershausen </PERSON>, 29, until Friday to buy the 4 - by 6-inch ad in The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> The judge on Oct. 26 also placed <PERSON> Germershausen </PERSON> on 35 years' probation. He pleaded guilty to fondling three children, ages 8 to 11, and sexually assaulting one of them two years ago. `` I thought, if he goes to jail, that's good because he'll be locked up; and while he's locked up, he's not going to hurt anybody anymore,'' <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said. `` But then I thought, once he got out, he'd go slinking back into the dark, and no one ever would know what he had done.'' <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said `` there does n't appear to be a sufficient social response to people like <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Germershausen </PERSON>. So I thought about other children and wondered whether I could use the sentencing process to effect some change.'' `` I think that this type of punishment by humiliation is not an appropriate form of punishment,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> commander faces an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe and calls for his firing over his department's practice of secretly taping telephone calls between suspects and their lawyers. `` I do n't think he should be around anymore,'' state Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulisano </PERSON> said of Col. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>. After the taping was disclosed Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate and Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> ordered a halt to the taping at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> barracks. The practice was disclosed Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was not aware such a practice existed and my immediate reaction is that it is unnecessary and inappropriate,'' the governor said in a statement. <PERSON> Forst </PERSON> was on vacation in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and unavailable for comment Tuesday. He was appointed by <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> in 1981. The Courant reported that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> routinely record virtually all calls to and from their barracks and have taped calls between suspects and lawyers for at least a year and possibly as long as 10 years at some barracks. Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sealander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, defended the taping as harmless, saying police do not actually monitor the conversations. `` No one is listening to the tapes,'' he said. The practice stunned defense attorneys, who called the taping blatantly illegal and said it could jeopardize past and present cases and expose the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> to lawsuits, large fines and criminal charges. `` That is really scary. Unbelievable. Outrageous,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. `` There goes the right to counsel.'' `` I would think that pending cases are subject to dismissal and that convictions are likely to be overturned,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a defense attorney. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> called the policy `` deeply disturbing'' and assigned Attorney General <PERSON> Clarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>, the chief state's attorney and the governor's legal counsel to investigate. <PERSON> Tulisano </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>'s dismissal. `` If I were a State Police officer, I would be damned upset to find out that every conversation I had with anybody _ even my spouse _ was being tape-recorded by my supervisors,'' <PERSON> Tulisano </PERSON> said.

 Jordanians voted for a new Parliament today in the first nationwide elections in 22 years, part of a democratic initiative by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> after riots over price increases left 10 people dead. `` A phase has ended in our lives and a new one is beginning today,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> told reporters during a visit to the campaign press center. Nearly 259,000 voters cast ballots by noon, almost 30 percent of those eligible, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said. Women voted for the first time in a general election since winning the right in 1974. In the first nationwide election since <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> renounced claims to the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 648 candidates _ including 12 women _ ran for 80 seats. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would be convened soon and that he would name a new Cabinet shortly after that. First returns were expected late today, and officials said they hoped to have complete but unofficial results on Thursday. The revamped <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ with no representatives from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ put the seal on <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s claim to the area. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Loss of the territory, which held half of the 60 seats in the old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, had made national elections impossible. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> suspended <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and revived it a decade later. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s monarchs have used their powers repeatedly to suspend the legislature and the previous Parliament was passive. Under the new system, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must approve all laws and can override a royal veto and remove Cabinets. Despite martial law and a 33-year-old ban on political parties, the king's government allowed political groups to run slates openly for the first time since 1956. It was one of the most open contests ever held in the Arab world. Competing for the support of 877,000 registered voters were Islamic fundamentalists, tribal sheiks, Communists, businessmen and former political prisoners. Urban candidates addressed rallies attended by thousands while some rural aspirants offered traditional camel-meat feasts to voters at Bedouin camps. The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood last week held the campaign's largest rally, attracting more than 5,000 people to a soccer field near downtown <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. There is no organized governing party and the leader or party that succeeds in forming a government will have to forge alliances to gain a parliamentary majority. Political observers predicted the Moslem Brotherhood could gain between 12 and 20 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, making it a major bloc. `` They are going to help the poor people,'' <PERSON> Mufad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, a 23-year-old unemployed vocational school graduate, said of the Moslem Brotherhood. He spoke at a rally attended by several hundred people chanting the party's slogan, `` God Is great, Islam is the solution.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must deal with rising unemployment and a 50 percent fall in the value of the national currency, the dinar, which sent prices of imported goods soaring. With few natural resources to support its 3 million people, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is suffering an economic crisis brought about partly by a drop in money sent home by Jordanian workers in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries where the oil boom has ended. April riots against price increases for gasoline, auto fees, telephone service, heating oil, cigarettes and alcoholic beverages led to the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>'s government.

 Miss <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> has been charged with brandishing a gun after an auto accident damaged the white sports coupe that is one the spoils of her office. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, a 19-year-old who came under fire after the Miss America Pageant for remarks deemed racist, was arrested with another motorist after the two swore out complaints against each other Tuesday, said Police Chief <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, 23, were freed on $ 200 bail. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> forced her 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> off the road and into a utility pole, causing damage estimated by police at $ 4,000. Immediately afterward, <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> brandished a handgun, police said. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> and a passenger were treated for minor injuries. Brandishing a gun carries up to six months in jail and a $ 200 fine. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> was charged with battery, destruction of property and reckless driving. The beauty queen came under fire earlier this year for remarks she made upon her return from the Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pageant, at which she failed to make the top 10. `` If it's political, it's not my fault,'' she said. `` If you look at the top 10, it's quite obvious. It was one black, one Korean, one Japanese, one hearing impaired, one kidney implant, and of course <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were part of the top 10. It makes you wonder.'' The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for her resignation.

 Voters streamed to the polls today, many after being thwarted by long lines the day before, to elect an assembly that is to write a constitution and declare <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Many voters camped overnight to keep their places in line after they were unable to reach the polling booths Tuesday. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force, said about 30 percent of the 701,483 registered voters cast their ballots Tuesday, a figure he called `` extremely encouraging.'' Several polling stations on Tuesday stayed open hours past closing time while others ran out of ballots and ink as they accomodated the crush of voters. At least one line was a mile long. Lines were shorter today, the second of five days of U.N.-supervised balloting in the predominantly black territory for the 72-member assembly. Seats will be allocated according to the proportion of votes each of the 10 political parties receive. Officials said voting could be extended to Sunday if necessary and that results could be announced on Wednesday of next week. <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said there had been scattered incidents of intimidation and distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the favored party, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. These actions `` degrade a process which is otherwise being carried out with self-control and dignity,'' he said. The main election issue is whether the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war, will get the two-thirds of the seats necessary to write a charter without consulting any of the other parties. Its main rival is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part of a transitional government installed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The chairman of the alliance, white farmer <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, accused the South African government and news media of deciding in advance that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> was sure to win. `` We are already fighting an uphill battle without it being made more difficult,'' he said. <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials were investigating allegations that alliance supporters forced Angolans across the northern Namibian border and pressured them to vote. He stressed that no one could vote who had not already been registered. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, spokesman for the territorial government, said, `` The people of our country will forever remember ... the feeling of expectation and election fervor'' of the day. He said one cause of the long delays was the large number of people who arrived to vote without bringing identification or voter registration cards. Some white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, eligible to vote because they used to live in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, flew on special chartered flights to vote at <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>'s airport. To reach some remote areas of the sparsely populated territory, helicopters were being used as mobile polling booths, flying to a different village each day. An estimated 60 percent of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s voters are illiterate. The 318,252-square-mile territory, rich in minerals, had a population of 1.3 million in 1981, when the last census was taken. Sporadic violence and intimidation marred the four-month campaign, including the assassination Sept. 12 of <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, the only prominent white member of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1915 and governed it under a League of Nations mandate. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> revoked the mandate in 1966 and, after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to leave, the SWAPO insurgency began. More than 20,000 people, most of them guerrillas, were killed in the bush war. Last year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to a U.N.-brokered accord calling for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> said the group would accept any election result certified by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Talks with Minister Break Down, Miners Fear Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking Arctic miners said today that talks with the minister of the coal industry have broken down and that they feared the government was preparing to crack down on the 2-week-old walkout. Coal Industry Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> after failing in a meeting Monday to convince workers to return to their jobs, and warning that the strikers could be held financially responsible for losses, said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON>, a strike leader at the <LOCATION> Vargashor </LOCATION> mine. `` Everything is ready for repression,'' <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> said. A regional court on Oct. 27 found the strike to be illegal and mine directors have started taking the names of workers who organized the walkouts, he said. Vargashor is the largest of a dozen mines on strike in the Arctic coal basin. Miners there walked off their jobs Oct. 25, complaining that the government had not improved living and working conditions as it promised in July. The government was forced to make those promises to end a nationwide walkout last summer of thousands of coal miners. During this strike, miners also have made political demands that include removing an article of the Soviet Constitution that declares the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to be the leading force in Soviet society. Miners want <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to send a commission that is empowered to negotiate the miners' demands, <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> said. `` We do n't care who leads it as long as they have the power to decide,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> added that some miners want Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> to negotiate with them. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on Sunday appealed to the miners in a telegram to go back to work because the country is short on coal as the winter season approaches. He said the government's record on fulfilling its promises will be reviewed at a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Nov. 17. But <PERSON> Kozlov </PERSON> said the miners did not return to work because <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> had not offered them anything. Miners' estimates of the number who have walked off their jobs have varied between 15,000 and 30,000. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said coal production in the area was 236,000 tons short of the target for the first six days of November.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says ``Civil War'' Inevitable in Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said today that civil war in his country is unavoidable because other nations are funneling arms to guerrillas bent on testing his government on the battlefield. In an interview with the official Cambodian news agency <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> downplayed recent victories by a three-party opposition coalition that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two non-Communist groups. He accused <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> of involvement in the military activities of the guerrillas. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said a number of countries had not honored their commitments to cease military aid to the coalition after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said it completed the withdrawal of all its forces in late September. Rebels say some of the troops remain. `` Hence a civil war is inevitable in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The Khmer reactionary forces and their outside supporters are intending to make a test of forces in the military field within six months before they engage in a new round of talks,'' <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. `` We are still advocating the settlement of the conflict through negotiations,'' he said in the interview that took place in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, was carried by <ORGANIZATION> SPK </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He said the first stage of the guerrilla's strategy was to seize the northwestern provinces of <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION>, Siem Reap and <PERSON> Bantey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meanchey </PERSON>. `` Over the past months, the enemy have made the highest possible efforts in their military campaigns involving almost all the armed forces of the three Khmer reactionary factions,'' he said. But he said the coalition's `` noisy claims about their so-called victories are nothing but a ploy of their psychological warfare.'' Since the Vietnamese troop pullout, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> have seized the gem-mining town of <LOCATION> Pailin </LOCATION> and moved towards <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, <LOCATION> Battambang </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanok </PERSON> have captured a number of government positions in the northwest. The Cambodian army is supplied by weapons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and until last month was backed by a formidable Vietnamese force which invaded the country in late 1978. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> of shipping military supplies to the guerrillas while <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have trained the two non-Communist groups. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> alone, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said, was training the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The prime minister said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military advisors plus some Thai mercenaries had joined the guerrillas during the recent offensive. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> denies sending lethal aid to the two non-Communist factions but provides other forms of assistance. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> have long been the major backers of the coalition.

 Actress <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>'s adopted son, who had battled heroin addiction in recent years, was found dead in his home, police said today. Police found no sign of foul play in the death of 27-year-old <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, said Detective <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalash </PERSON>. `` We do not know the cause of death at this point. We will have to wait for an autopsy report,'' he said. <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, whose mother is married to actor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, was the focus of his mother's second book, `` Life Lines,'' which was published earlier this year and recounted his struggle with heroin. He made numerous attempts at drug rehabilitation and said in April he had been clean for two months after one month in a recovery program. `` I just hope, in the end, it can help somebody,'' he said of his mother's book. His body was found by a friend Tuesday night at his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Kalash </PERSON> said. Miss Ireland adopted <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> after she suffered a miscarriage while married to actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> of the 1960s TV series `` The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' Miss Ireland and <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> divorced in 1967 and she married <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> a year later. `` I thought I had adopted the child of a married architect and a young Irish girl,'' the actress said in a recent interview. `` Instead I had adopted a drug addict's child.'' She has called the battle to save her son from drugs a greater trauma than her five-year battle with cancer. Miss Ireland starred with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> in several action movies, including `` The Mechanic'' and `` Love and Bullets.''

 A powerful car bomb exploded today in Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing four people and wounding 19. The blast came shortly before the expected arrival of newly elected President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> in the city's Moslem sector. The booby-trapped car went off in the <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> neighborhood, about three blocks from the posh villa where Mouawad planned to stay. The presidential palace, traditional seat of the head of state, is occupied by rebellious army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who rejected <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election Sunday by members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> under a peace plan <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposes. The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority, and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has specifically criticized it for not including a timetable for a withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s estimated 40,000 troops. Police said four people were killed and 19 wounded in the blast today. Window glass of apartment and office buildings was shattered by the 3:15 p.m. explosion. Half a dozen cars were set ablaze in a parking lot as Syrian soldiers, clutching AK-47 rifles, converged on the scene. They fired in the air to make way for ambulances and fire engines that raced to area, the witnesses said, insisting on anonymity. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief was quoted as saying his militia may try to kill <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for rejecting the election of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>, a 64-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Sources said that before the end of the week, <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> would announce formation of a national reconciliation government to end 14 years of civil war. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying his militia has among its ranks other fighters such as <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON>, who tried to kill renegade <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army Maj. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON> was wounded and treated in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I stress that <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON> who managed to strike at the head of treason in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is capable of reaching the head of the secessionists and mutineers in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' he told the party newspaper An-Nida. Miss <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON> is still being held by <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON>'s Israeli-backed militia, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which helps patrol <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The party comprises a few hundred fighters, most of them of Christian families. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who headed a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in a dual government that ruled for 13 months, opposes <ORGANIZATION> Mouawad </ORGANIZATION> because the president advocated close ties with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fought the Syrians for six months this year until an Arab League truce was enforced in September. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> commanded about 20,000 Christian troops during the fight against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. But it remains unclear how many troops will continue to back him in the confrontation with <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>.

<HEAD>First Securities Market Founded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first securities market since the Communists took power 43 years ago was formally established today, and one newspaper reported the exchange will develop into a full-fledged stock market. The Financial and <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION>, to begin operating Dec. 31, will at first deal only in short-term documents such as banking certificates and will initially be used only by financial institutions, said the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. It will eventually evolve into a full stock market, allowing individual citizens to participate, reported the government-supervised newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are preparing to have in the future a stock market like any other ... which will also be connected to international markets,'' said <PERSON> Dragutin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajic </PERSON>, an advisor in the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview with the daily. The exchange is a major landmark in efforts of Premier Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> to radically reform <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s stagnating economy and bring it into line with Western economic practices. The government is seeking parliamentary approval for legislation allowing government-owned and private enterprises and other institutions to issue stocks and bonds, which would be dealt with on the newly-established exchange. Founding of the exchange was one of the conditions set by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> at last week's round of negotiations aimed at providing <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> with continued financial support, according to press reports. The Communists abolished <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s three existing stock exchanges in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> when they created a centrally planned economy along Soviet lines in 1946. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is currently faced with an annual inflation rate approaching 1,500 percent, a $ 17 billion foreign debt and rising unemployment. Economic performance has stagnated throughout the past decade. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s 6-month-old government is committed to introducing market mechanisms into the economy as a way out of the crisis and has already allowed for large-scale private enterprise and foreign investment. A sweeping reform of the country's innefficient banking system is also under way.

 More than 250 people who worked at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant during the 1986 accident or helped clean up after it have died, a newspaper reported today. The toll reported by the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was far higher than the official toll of 31 killed in the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the government agency that is responsible for the Chernobyl cleanup acknowledged the figure of 250 dead but said only the 31 could be traced directly to the disaster, the world's worst atomic accident. `` More than 250 people of those who were at work at the time of the explosion or worked on liquidating the consequences of the 20th century's greatest accident, have already died,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News said. It said they died of various illnesses, and that no one can tell what the full human cost of the disaster will be. The article, on a new association of those concerned about the accident, did not say what the source of the figure was or provide any more details of it. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also printed a report on the association, which calls itself simply `` Chernobyl,'' but it did not use such a figure. However, it did say that `` many of those who worked for a long time in conditions that were dangerous for their health, need help today.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasyuk </PERSON>, an engineer and spokesman for the Kombinat organization that is handling the cleanup said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>: `` We ca n't say that those 250 died directly from illnesses caused by radiation.'' <PERSON> Karasyuk </PERSON> said he is a member of the Chernobyl association. The register of the dead included some people who died of illnesses from which they suffered even before an explosion and fire ripped through Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor. More scientific study was needed, he said. Further information on the figures could not be obtained immediately. Most offices in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were closed because today was taken as a holiday after the celebration of the 72nd anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. The figure of 31 dead, which officials have used as the death toll since just months after the accident, includes 28 people who died of radiation sickness, two who died of burns and one who had a heart attack trying to put out the fire, <PERSON> Karasyuk </PERSON> said. Officials say they give regular medical check-ups to thousands of people who were exposed to radiation in the accident. A radiation center in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, about 80 miles south of the power plant, has files on about 600,000 people, the Kombinat spokesman said. After the accident, which released a cloud of radioactive material that circled the world, Soviet officials evacuated thousands of people in an 18-mile zone around the plant. The Chernobyl accident already has cost the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> billions of dollars, and spawned a strong anti-nuclear movement. A report in March said almost a quarter-million people still were living on land so contaminated that they can not eat food grown on it, and three years after the accident officials still are evacuating more people from the area surrounding the plant.

<HEAD>Lawyers Confer With Mandela, Say He Seeks Black Unity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, jailed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, appealed today for unity among rival black organizations, according to lawyers who conferred with him. `` His message is about unity, that people should forget about petty differences,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunene </PERSON>, one of three officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who met with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for more than three hours. The meeting came amid speculation <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is spearheading an effort to reconcile the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a rival guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON>, has been invited to visit <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for several days starting Thursday. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the best-known black leader in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> despite having been jailed since 1962, sent an invitation two weeks ago to the lawyers. One of them, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseneke </PERSON>, was a fellow prisoner of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for 10 years after being convicted at age 15 of illegal activities on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Another of the lawyers, <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitje </PERSON>, worked closely with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cogress </ORGANIZATION>' Youth League in the 1950s and early 60s. `` It was very exciting,'' said <PERSON> Pitje </PERSON> of his first sight of Mandela since 1964. `` I had a difficult task stopping the tears from flowing.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for plotting anti-government sabotage and currently lives in a former staff residence at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Last month, eight political prisoners, including <PERSON> Masemola </PERSON> and five of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s co-defendants in the 1964 trial, were freed unconditionally. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is widely expected within the next few months. The lawyers said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> declined to discuss the prospects of his release. They said he tried unsuccessfully to arrange for the release of two other political prisoners last month, but they did not elaborate. The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have differed bitterly over political philosophy. The African National Congress includes white supporters while the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advocates black self-reliance in the struggle to end apartheid. <PERSON> Kuene </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> does not view himself as a one-man force that will bring negotiations about. `` He said no one single person can tackle the issue of negotiation. It's a matter for all the organization, not for individuals,'' said <PERSON> Kunene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moseneke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` is in excellent condition physically and has an amazingly retentive memory.''

<HEAD>Kemp Gives Unprecedented Approval to House Homeless in Public Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the nation's housing chief, has given the city unprecedented approval to offer vacant public housing units to the homeless. The secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement Tuesday during a tour of housing rehabilitation projects on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. He said his agency, which funds public housing, is waiving a requirement that smaller <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> apartments be rented only to low-income families, the elderly or the handicapped. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesperson did not immediately return a call today seeking comment on whether whether <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> planned to exempt low-income housing units in other cities. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> had requested the rule change to help fill the agency's 1,200 vacant one-bedroom apartments. Homeless people will get first claim on 400 to 600 of the units to be made available starting this winter, he said. The units are too small for many of the 38,000 families on the housing agency's waiting list, he said. `` We will continue to take care of families who need help _ that's our ongoing responsibility,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` But for the first time we are going to allow public housing rules to be changed so that single men and women who are homeless can also have access to public housing units.'' `` This is a very positive step,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. The group estimates as many as 40,000 people in the city are homeless at one time or another during the year.

<HEAD>Detained Israeli Tanker Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities have ordered the release of an Israeli-owned tanker detained almost three weeks after it allegedly spilled oil in Egyptian waters, the ship's owners said today. The 103,332-ton Panama-registered Nyuta is expected to head for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Thursday, said <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned partly by the Israeli government. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON>, the tanker's skipper, will be in command, as Egyptian authorities allowed him to leave despite a pending court case, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. The release order followed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a $ 1.5 million letter of guarantee obtained by the owners from its insurers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In addition, the ship owners promised to pay any fine the court imposed on <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said.

 Black Democrats, scoring precedent-shattering victories in mayoral elections around the nation, are taking control of city hall for the first time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and other cities while regaining it in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> challenged a century-old racial barrier and claimed a thin margin of victory in his race for governor, while blacks extended and solidified their control of some of the nation's biggest cities in Tuesday's odd-year elections `` It's an excellent testament to the people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, to the people of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short span of time,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, declaring himself the winner and the nation's first elected black governor. The Republican whip in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, acknowledged the gains for black Democrats. `` I think a clear signal was sent that Americans will vote for the best qualified candidates,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said on the `` CBS This Morning'' show. `` While I really wish our guys had won, there is something fundamentally good for this country.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the two-time black presidential contender, said, `` These gains represent expansion for the group that was locked out.'' In the main mayoral event, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> won election in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> _ the first time a black has been elected mayor of the nation's largest city. Other Democrats who won election as mayor, and who will become the first blacks to head their cities, were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> was elected in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, succeeding white Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who is black, won a fifth four-year term by defeating black challenger <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' election in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s claim to a narrow victory in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race raised the likelihood a new array of elected black leaders would gain national prominence. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip and the nation's highest black elected figure, praised <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' election and said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters `` have rejected the politics of fear. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> withstood late campaign attacks on his character and integrity. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s apparent success `` gives us all hope _ hope that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is maturing and that people are able to make decisions without regard to race, but on the issues.'' The off-year election put Democratic blacks in control of most of the nation's big city mayors' offices. Going into Tuesday's balloting, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were the nation's biggest cities with a white mayor <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> voters returned <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> to office Tuesday, and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> voters did the same for <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>. White was elected <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s new mayor by defeating longtime city council president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> in a bitter contest between two black candidates who once were allies. His victory gives the city its first black mayor since <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> left office nearly two decades ago, the first of the big-city black mayors. The candidacies of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic lieutenant governor, and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, were noteworthy for their similar methods. Both ran as mainstream, middle-of-the-road candidates who stressed their experience in elected office. They projected an image that was far from the fiery-preacher and populist outsider appeal of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In fact, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s campaign deliberately kept <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at arms' length for fear of alienating white voters. Both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> appealed for broad support from white voters while counting on near-total support from black voters. `` Both of these candidates, who had a fairly similar strategy in some ways, will be viewed as role models,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, specializing in race and politics. `` For the future direction of black politics, there will be a lot of inspiration about what can be done.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was seeking to become the first black governor of a state since Reconstruction and the first black elected governor ever. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, elected in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, is a veteran <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> state senator who easily defeated Republican Alderwoman <PERSON> Robie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pooley </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' victory came in a closely contested non-partisan race with conservative candidate <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Strawbridge </PERSON>. The election `` symbolizes heightened security and maturity for white males in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` In the'60s we integrated the lunch counters and the libraries. Now we are integrating the psyche and the mind of white <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> opened a seven-nation <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> meeting today with a new call to negotiate a regional treaty limiting nuclear weapons. `` We are prepared for negotiations to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region on a non-discriminatory basis,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told foreign ministers from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and six other nations of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is widely reported to have developed nuclear weapons capability despite denials by Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded what it termed a `` peaceful nuclear device'' in 1974. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s latest proposal came at the start of a two-day meeting which is meant to set the stage for a December summit of the association's leaders, probably in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Other members are <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>. The association's nations represent a combined population of more than 1 billion people who earn on average about $ 150 a year. The foreign ministers were originally to meet in July but it was canceled after a Sri Lankan boycott to protest <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s refusal to withdraw more than 50,000 of its soldiers from the island nation. The two countries have since reached an agreement. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has fought three unsuccessful wars with neighboring <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, previously has offered to enter into several bilateral non-nuclear agreements. Predominantly Hindu <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have tried to thaw traditionally cold relations since Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s left-leaning government came to power following elections a year ago. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has refused to discuss non-proliferation with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> because he claims the military and not Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s civilian government is in charge of the program. Analysts say <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has rejected talks mainly because it wants to keep its nuclear weapons option open in response to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, its rival northern neighbor, which has been a nuclear power since 1964. `` The problems of underdevelopment must not be compounded by misgivings and misperceptions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told the foreign ministers. `` The legacy of mistrust, suspicion and genuine security concerns need to be overcome.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who is expecting her second child within a month, said one third of child deaths worldwide occur in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The association's charter signed four years ago in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> prohibits overtly political initiatives. It was organized to concentrate on trade, cultural, health and environmental matters. The last summit was held in December 1988 in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is seeking a nearly 5 percent cut in spending by all state agencies to help make up a projected revenue shortfall of nearly $ 280 million. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> proposed the cuts Tuesday in an effort to balance <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 23 billion budget in light of lower-than-expected tax collections. The governor recommended all state agencies be ordered to reduce spending 4.9 percent for the seven months left in the fiscal year. He and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> must vote on the proposal and are expected to do so Thursday. The cuts do not require legislative approval. In addition, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> ordered agencies under his direct authority to fill only one of every two vacancies after Dec. 1 and curtail travel and the purchase of supplies. State economists attributed the shortfall to consumers saving more and spending less. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON>, the governor's budget director, said also that economists overestimated revenue from sales and corporate income taxes.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a courtly figure in a clamorous campaign, defeated an aggressive Republican prosecutor to become the city's first black mayor in what he hailed as a triumph over `` division and suspicion.'' `` We held to the high road and we proved that it is the right road to victory,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> told supporters early today. `` And whatever the final margin, I like to think that we won a great victory against the division and suspicion.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a 62-year-old Democrat, attracted nearly all of the black vote, roughly a third of the white vote and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> vote, and about 70 percent of the Hispanic vote. `` Ours is a new coalition of conscience and purpose,'' he said. `` One that has room for everyone and excludes no one. We will search city and nation to find the best minds and the best ideas.'' With all but six of the city's 5,237 precincts reporting, the unofficial count showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with 898,534 votes, or 50 percent, while <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor who ran as a reformer, had 856,448 votes, or 48 percent. Conservative and Right to Life candidates each had 1 percent. Pollsters said late-deciding voters helped close the margin of victory compared with the double-digit lead <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> maintained in opinion polls through last week. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a background figure for more than 20 years in the state assembly, and as city clerk and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, will succeed brash <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, whose attempt to become the city's first four-term mayor was derailed in the September primary `` We passed another milestone on freedom's road _ a victory not for African Americans alone but for all New Yorkers and for all Americans,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters also decided to change the city government, approving a new charter by 55-45 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled this year that the city's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, which decided most land-use and budget issues, was unconstitutional because it gave equal power to five boroughs with widely varying populations. A commission wrote up the new charter, which got rid of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, increased the size of the City Council from 35 to 51 and gave what some feel is more power to the mayor. To reach City Hall, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> withstood <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s relentless attack on his competence and integrity, and responded with a call for unity and tolerance. `` We held to the high road and we proved that it is the right road to victory,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. `` And whatever the final margin, I like to think that we won a great victory against the division and suspicion.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, hoping to become the first Republican mayor since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> in 1965, had spent most of the campaign slamming <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> as a `` clubhouse politician'' whose sloppy financial dealings bode ill for a city that has weathered several corruption scandals. The strong showing in this Democratic stronghold will make the 45-year-old <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> a force in state Republican politics. In his concession speech, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> screamed at his supporters to stop booing <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' name, urged them to unite behind the mayor-elect _ and appeared to keep the door open for another shot at <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> will have a difficult task ahead of him,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. `` Our city is troubled in deep and serious ways. Every prayer you have ever said for me, every assistance you have ever given me, all the patience and support you have shown to me, I ask you now to give to our new mayor.'' But he later told the crowd: `` You did a miracle _ 48 percent of the vote, when Republicans are outnumbered 5-to-1 in this city. `` And you did it because we tapped a chord, we reached for a feeling that exists in this city for reform, for a new kind of politics. We almost made it, but we're not stopping, are we?'' In <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> grew up, joy was evident. `` I feel proud,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who celebrated in <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' uptown headquarters on 125th Street. `` It's a reinforcement of black pride. Twelve years of Mayor <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was just enough. I expect less homeless and more racial togetherness. Those are the two main things.'' Blacks make up a quarter of the city's population. But <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, whose campaign themes of unity and tolerance resonated at a time when violent racial incidents shook the city, pointed to his broad-based support and urged that it continue. `` What can unite us is far stronger than the forces that can keep us apart,'' he said. `` I intend to be the mayor of all the people, not just for those who voted for me.''

 State Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> won a mayoral race marked by heated rhetoric and name-calling, defeating City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> in a nonpartisan contest between two black Democrats. `` Tonight is a time to cheer.

I pledge to you, under my leadership, we shall be one city.'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who had called his opponent a slumlord, making polticial hay of nearly 200 city housing code violations lodged against seven rental properties owned by <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said in his concession speech he thought <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s race was well-run. `` If I can be of assistance to him, all he has to do is call me,'' said <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, 59. His term expires at the end of this year, and he said he plans to leave government and concentrate on his law practice. With all precincts reporting, <PERSON> White </PERSON> had 85,829 votes, or 56 percent, to 68,167 votes, or 44 percent, for <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. He succeeds Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, who is stepping aside to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for governor.

We did as well as we could. We had a great game plan, and the people of this community have decided that they wanted new leadership.'' In a tearful concession speech, Ms. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> _ the only incumbent mayoral candidate not returned _ thanked supporters for her time in office. `` I ca n't say that this is easy, because it's not. It hurts. But the last six years as mayor have been the best years of my life. Thank you,'' she said, barely finishing her sentence.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that the president has the power to violate international law by ordering the seizure of terrorists or drug traffickers without the consent of other nations. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, who wrote a legal opinion giving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> authority to make such arrests, said such violations of international law would be justified to thwart terrorist attacks or capture drug dealers harbored by another country. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief legal adviser, endorsed <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s legal reasoning but warned of the dangers of making such arrests because `` all nations need to take into account the reactions of other nations to conduct which departs from accepted norms.'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on civil and constitutional rights that seizing terrorists or drug traffickers in violation of international law but in self-defense would be legally justifiable. `` In response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack, we would have good grounds under general principles of international law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a foreign sovereign's objections,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. `` In appropriate circumstances we may have a sound basis under international law to take action against large-scale drug traffickers being given safe haven by a government acting in complicity with their criminal enterprise,'' he added. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> stressed that the legal opinion did not mean a change in government policy that requires cooperation with other nations before an arrest on foreign soil is made. Overseas arrests without a foreign government's consent would only be undertaken with approval of the president. `` It may well be that the president will choose to direct extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified in doing so as a matter of self-defense under international law,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. But `` it is ultimately the president's judgment as to the need for a particular operation that is controlling for purposes of domestic law.'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> outlined the hazards of pursuing such a policy, noting danger to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents overseas and the inevitable `` adverse impact on our bilateral relations with the country in which we act.'' `` We need to consider the fact that our legal position may be seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct against our interests,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>, the subcommittee's chairman noted that the Iranian parliament `` has cited the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion to say that they have the same right to come into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to arrest their fugitives without our knowledge and kidnap them.'' The June 21 opinion, which the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has refused to make public, states <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to snatch fugitives in foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in extradition proceedings. It reverses a 1980 department ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> lacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal authority to ignore international law. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> on Tuesday defended the agency's refusal to make public the opinion or give it to the subcommittee, saying it was confidential legal advice given to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said not even members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are entitled to see the legal advice the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gives other executive branch agencies. He said, `` Why would we treat the committee any differently than the news media or the general public?'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> expressed dismay over <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>'s statement, saying: `` Maybe the department needs more experience, it needs an education about how the government is supposed to work in a free society.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he hoped the hearing `` will guide them along that path.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, responding to news accounts of the opinion, have said it does not represent policy but merely an evaluation of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s legal authority. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday the opinion was sought because the bureau's jurisdiction has been expanded to investigate terrorist acts overseas against Americans. `` We're seeking to be as innovative and as fully responsible to congressional intent as we can possibly be,'' Sessions said. But Sessions said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would n't exercise its legal authority to grab fugitives without permission from the highest levels of the administration. `` We are not now contemplating any particular undertaking that would involve that particular capability.'' But Sessions said he envisioned circumstances when it could be used. `` I think that the capability obviously and the approval of that kind of operation could be reality.''

 A couple hired to clean carpets were found dead at the customer's home of carbon monoxide poisoning from their gasoline-powered generator. The bodies of <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Selma </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> were discovered Tuesday by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, who had hired them.

 A terrier that strayed onto an elevated railway halted rush-hour commuter traffic for 1 -LCB- hours, eluding dogged pursuers who chased it up and down the tracks above the streets of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We did n't want to be heartless and just run over the dog,'' said transit spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The dog apparently entered the Metrorail system by ducking under a street-level turnstile Tuesday. The transit agency cut power to 1 -LCB- miles of track in case the fare-beater or its pursuers came into contact with an electrified rail. When the stray was finally cornered and collared, the posse `` looked as tired as the dog,'' said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> animal control specialist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. The terrier, a female, was taken to the pound to be either claimed by its owner or put up for adoption.

 An end to tolls at the exits of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> has been delayed a week so Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> can close the toll booths with flair. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted to eliminate 12 toll booths, where motorists are charged 25 cents to 75 cents as they get off the turnpike, saying the booths do n't generate enough revenue to make them worthwhile. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> had scheduled a ceremony for today in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to mark the occasion, but it was moved to Tuesday near <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>. `` It was rescheduled because the turnpike authority felt <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON> would be the more appropriate place to conduct the ceremony because it is in the central part of the turnpike and serves more people,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the delay will allow time to gather supporting players and props for the ceremony, including turnpike workers, trucks and heavy construction equipment. The 88-mile turnpike was built in the 1950s. It runs between <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and is a main north-south route between the northern <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the Southeast. Legislators said the exit tolls, referred to as `` nuisance'' tolls, bring in only $ 2.2 million a year and discourage motorists from stopping in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Nov. 7 Central Maine Morning Sentinel, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, on Soviet-bloc reforms: The changes wrought on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under ... perestroika have come so frequently over the past couple of years that they've lost their shock value in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Disarmament proposals from the Soviets are routine. The public return of <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenburg </PERSON>'s effects, with an apology from the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, was unusual but not startling. But last week's mea culpa from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar base _ was astounding. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the Soviet legislature that the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was illegal and undertaken behind the backs of the Soviet people. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Siberian radar violated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and would be dismantled. But that was n't all. On the same day, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> marked the anniversary of its 1956 uprising by declaring itself a republic. Still on the same day, 300,000 East Germans marched through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, calling for democracy. Perestroika has spread and is spreading. But while the news was breaking in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials were trying to prove that they were ready with the new opportunities for change. The `` clearest opportunity to reduce the risk of war since the dawn of the nuclear age,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> 3d said, later adding, `` It would be folly indeed to miss this opportunity.'' Folly indeed. The opportunity is so great, that to squander it would be one of the most grievous mistakes of the nuclear age. And it could happen, sooner than one would think. Hard-line communism is lurking in the shadows.

 Nov. 5 The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, on Soviet-bloc reforms: As <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Economistput it, you do n't go bang by stages. There is something beguiling in the notion of a `` controlled explosion,'' the idea that after 40 years of communist rule Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Marxist leaders could manage a transition to democracy without everything going smash In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been lured by the same siren song, thinking he could reform the stagnant Russian economy incrementally without repudiating the core doctrines of communism. In both cases it appears that the old Soviet bloc may be headed for a major crash. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has adopted a hands-off policy toward European reform apparently on the assumption that change could be controlled in two ways: -LRB- 1 -RRB- Communist parties would retain a significant share of power, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- there would be no dismantling of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Again, as the Economist notes, sensible Hungarians wish to avoid questioning <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, and Western governments are not eager for them to tempt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But the effect of democratization in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has been that politicians there now worry more about the voters than the Russians, and lots of Hungarians want <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to become neutral like <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. All this change in the most sensitive areas of the Soviet empire comes as ... <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economy approaches chaos and parts of the country the striking coal miners in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, for instance are close to open rebellion. ... <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has tried to reform the economy without jettisoning Marxism-Leninism outright. That may be impossible. It may take an honest-to-goodness revolution to pull the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> out of its doldrums.

Why, the pickup truck is a thing of beauty. On the front end, it's sleek and chromey, just like the cars people drive in town. But on the back end, it's stout and practical and can carry several bales of hay when needed. It's what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be _ honest, rough, ready, but with a clean face whenever possible. And here these people are banning it. Maligning the pickup truck! It's almost beyond belief. The explanation <LOCATION> Flossmoor </LOCATION> citizens give for their ban on the public parking of pickups within their corporate limits is that pickups are `` unattractive.'' Well, if that's how it's going to be, then we can imagine any number of bans that might be easy to sell to other communities. How about a ban on ... gazebos? There are lots of Americans who might find it painful to suddenly turn a corner or glance up a hill and have their vision accosted by one of these big fat frou-frou monstrosities. What about their sensitivities? ... A ban on the public parking of pickup trucks is a direct assault on the American way of life, the Constitution, the family unit, agriculture, progress, history, liberty, social responsibility and pets. Federal issue, indeed! Strike it down, we say. Strike it down now.

 Jury selection began today for the trial of a man charged with 27 counts of murder in the nation's deadliest drunken driving accident, the 1988 crash of a wrong-way pickup truck and a church bus. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, who authorities say drank as much as a case of beer the day of the crash, is charged with 83 counts in all, including drunken driving, assault and wanton endangerment over injuries to those who escaped the burning bus. Some 100 prospective jurors arrived today. Attorneys have said selecting a jury could take two to three weeks, and the trial itself could last two months. Tight security was imposed at the tiny courthouse, including a metal detector at the courtroom entrance. `` We want to do it once, and we want to do it right,'' said Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON>. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said he expected most of the jury pool to have heard of the case, which prompted a national debate over school bus safety and renewed attention on drunken driving. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>, is accused of driving his truck the wrong way on Interstate 71 and crashing into a former school bus from the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church. The bus was returning from an outing to an amusement park. Twenty-four members of a youth group and three adults died, all from smoke inhalation. `` My defense will revolve around whether <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is a murderer or whether <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was involved in a traffic manslaughter,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>. The defense attorney said he planned to ask potential jurors if they or someone in their families had been convicted of drunken driving `` to understand that these people are everywhere.'' `` There's thousands and thousands of people each year in this commonwealth convicted of DWI,'' <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. The defendant's blood-alcohol level was 0.26 percent 90 minutes after the accident, and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator testified during board hearings that at the time of the accident it likely would have been 0.29 percent. That is nearly three times the state's 0.10 percent threshhold for drunken driving and two-thirds of a lethal dose of alcohol, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulden </PERSON>, who estimated <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> would have consumed a case _ 24 cans _ of beer to reach that level. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in a case several years ago. After the crash, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> spent several weeks in a hospital and was then examined at the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He was jailed until October 1988, when his family put together enough money and property to post his $ 540,000 bond. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> returned to work at his job at <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> and lives with his parents. He neither drives nor drinks anymore, <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s drunkenness was the probable cause of the accident, but went on to recommend the oldest 20 percent of the nation's school bus fleet be taken out of service as unsafe. The board also recommended stricter standards for fuel tank protection, emergency exits and the flammability of seat covers on school buses.

 The Sandinista government said today it will propose a new cease-fire plan that calls for a dismantling of the U.S.-backed rebel force. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> outlined a 15-point plan that he will propose during a meeting with the Contras on Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If the Contras do n't accept this plan, they will be voting for war,'' said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who last week ended a 19-month truce with the rebels. The Sandinista proposal urges the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to divert toward the Contras' demobilization what remains of a $ 49 million package in non-lethal rebel aid the Congress authorized in March. The plan also includes creation of routes within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for the rebels to use to return to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where the commission would provide certificates for their repatriation or relocation in third countries, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He spoke at a news conference after the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> delegation, headed by Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, left for the talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As a concession to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> offered to suspend temporarily <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s weapons imports until next April 25, but only after the demobilization accord is signed. This seemed an empty gesture since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this year it had suspended weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A general amnesty would be offered once at least 50 percent of the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people they hold, he said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> asked for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting to discuss demobilization of the Contras. He proposed it when he announced an end to a 19-month cease-fire last week. The Contra rebels are to disband and leave their Honduran camps voluntarily by the first few days of December under an agreement signed by <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and three other Central American governments Aug. 7. About 12,000 rebels were in neighboring Honduran camps Aug. 7. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he ended the cease-fire because more than 1,100 rebels had moved back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in recent weeks. The rebel delegation went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, rebel sources in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> said. The Contras have said they want a resumption of the cease-fire, a general amnesty and guarantees they can visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to verify that sufficient reforms have been made to allow their safe return. Rebels and the government last met directly in June 1988 in an effort to turn a temporary truce signed in March into a permanent peace. The effort failed when the government refused to accept <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> demands, among them an end to Sandinista control of the army and police.

<TEXT>
 Americans and Soviets have at least one thing in common _ many do n't know much geography and show `` an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them,'' a Gallup poll showed today. In the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, young Soviets scored significantly higher than their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts, but did n't do well when compared with adults of all age groups in the 10 nations where the test was given. For example, Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified an average of 9.3 of 16 locations on a world map, ranking fourth along with Canadians and Italians. Young <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults came in last, with an average of 6.9 correct. Overall, however, Soviets as a whole identified an average of 7.4 of a possible 16 locations. That put them at the bottom with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. American adults ranked only slightly higher with 8.6 correct. Swedes were at the top with an average of 11.6 correct. The survey was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to find how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> compared with its neighbors and other industrialized nations. The 16 places on the world map were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We believe the results from the survey point to a startling superpower comparison,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which called the international geography survey the largest of its kind. `` Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them.'' The other overall scores were West Germans, 11.2; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 9.7; <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 9.3; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 9.2; the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, 8.5; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 7.6; and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 7.4. Thirteen percent of Soviet adults were unable to correctly identify the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on a world map, while 14 percent of the Americans could not correctly identify the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. About 1,500 Soviet adults were surveyed this spring in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Kursk, an industrial city of 425,000 people, 300 miles south of the capital. Nearly 11,000 people in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were tested in the spring of 1988 and the results were announced last year. Geographic Society President <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said the survey result `` reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography in American classrooms.'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyenkov </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the survey with Gallup, said `` it was a shock'' that the overall Soviet results fell short of Soviet researchers' expectations `` I did n't believe Soviet citizens know so little about geography,'' he said. `` I rechecked the data many times. The results were unbelievable. They will have very great repercussions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Upmeyer </PERSON>, a Gallup vice president, attributed the poor overall ranking of the Soviets to low scores among those over 55 years old, who grew up in war times without adequate educational opportunities. Nearly 90 percent of the Soviets surveyed _ compared with 47 percent of the Americans _ said they had taken a course devoted entirely to geography. Those surveyed in the 10 nations were interviewed in their homes and asked to locate the same 13 countries, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on an unmarked world map. The Soviets also were asked to locate <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which borders it to the south. Despite heavy Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the past decade, only four people in 10 could find it on the world map. Only about a third of the Americans and Soviets located <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. And only about 25 percent in each country picked out the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. About 40 percent of the Soviets did not recognize the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, confusing it with the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>.

Long lines of mourners, many of them wearing black and some openly sobbing, paid their last respects all night before the funeral. By early Wednesday, cars and buses were parked for several miles either side of the highway that bisects the settlement. Makeshift shelters were errected and huge amounts of food were brought in.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party has a monopoly on power in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although four small parties are tolerated to give the system a semblance of a democracy. The four `` block parties'' until now have been allied with the Communists and have closely followed Communist policies in return for holding a few relatively insignificant posts. In recent days, three parties have urged the party to implement reforms. The Communist Party's leading role in East German society is guaranteed in the country's constitution. The Politburo, the nation's top decision-making body, was streamlined Wednesday from 21 to 11 members, with four new reform-minded members elected to the body and seven members surviving from the old one. The party's general secretary, <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, is the most powerful man in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He is also head of state and chief of the <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> _ commander in chief of the armed forces. In theory, the highest organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the party <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which usually meets every five years. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> elects a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ currently at 163 members _ to act for it between sessions. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approves the Politburo, which runs the country between <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meetings. In practice, the Politburo usually makes all major decisions. The party also controls the the 500-member People's Chamber, or parliament, which acts as a rubber-stamp body that approves party decisions. The parliament also chooses the Council of Ministers, or the government. The government usually includes some Politburo members who run key ministries such as defense and security. The party has `` cells'' in the army and factories, which effectively ensure the party's control and supervision of the society and economy. It also runs a workers' militia, a paramilitary force. The parliament is elected by popular vote but is limited to single candidates proposed and approved by the party. Opposition leaders say the elections are rigged to ensure the election of party candidates.

<TEXT>
 Deputies tired of slogging out to the middle of a swamp to destroy marijuana plants decided to end the problem by blowing up the field. Attacking the problem by getting rid of the dirt instead of what grows in it, sheriff's investigators Tuesday blew up some 20 dirt mounds where 2,000 pot plants had been destroyed in three raids over the past year. There was no marijuana planted there when bomb experts rigged about 20 charges and blew the mounds _ along with trees, weeds, foul water and almost certainly a considerable number of confused snakes _ into the afternoon sky. Maj. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foy </PERSON> said as much as $ 100,000 in marijuana could be harvested in a single crop from the mounds. No one has ever been arrested in the raids, and investigators said it was only a matter of time before someone again took advantage of the isolated site.

 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops voted overwhelmingly to let laymen and nuns conduct Sunday worship services in isolated communities that lack priests. Communities in such states as <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> are expected to be affected by the proposal, which was approved late Tuesday 225-18 in a tally announced this morning. The measure still must be approved by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liturgy </ORGANIZATION>, said a survey showed 51 dioceses with severe clergy shortages already have Sunday celebrations without a priest. Parishes in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have had priestless celebrations for 12 years, said Bishop <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said the measure will provide uniform guidelines for worship services in areas where a priest is unavailable. But Retired Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of the Diocese of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> charged that approval of the rite `` will bless a monster that could destroy the Sunday Mass tradition.'' At worship services, laymen will be allowed to distribute Communion wafers that were consecrated by a priest. Such services are not Masses because the consecration does not take place during the celebration. Mass must still be led by a priest. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Bishops today put off until tomorrow another controversial issue: a proposed statement on AIDS seeking to drop the conference's earlier qualified support for condom education in public schools. The statement urges that youngsters be taught chastity instead. The bishops also unanimously approved a statement declaring that the world's system of producing and distributing food is `` adrift without a moral compass.'' It calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to change tax policies to promote farm ownership and seek to reduce reliance on commercial fertilizers and pesticides. The bishops said the growing concentration of farm land in a few corporate hands threatens the common good. `` We have to return the means of production to the greatest number of people possible,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the bishops approved a policy statement declaring that no <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> can responsibly take a `` pro-choice'' stand, and made a special plea to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> public officials to pursue legislation limiting abortion Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the church was nearly alone in its stance. `` We may be the only major population segment in our country, the only nationwide institution, so fully committed to protect and defend the rights of the unborn. We may be in reality the only moral conscience in our country willing to be proclaimed publicly,'' he said. On the abortion issue, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> abortion-rights activist accused the prelates of being `` a political bully'' and predicted their position will come to no avail. `` This is a political war they can not win,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissling </PERSON>, executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bishops' renewed activism on abortion follows a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case giving states broader authority to regulate abortion. They said abortion is an issue of `` overriding concern'' to Catholics, the nation's largest religious denomination. `` No Catholic can responsibly take a ` pro-choice' stand when the ` choice' in question involves the taking of innocent human life,'' the bishops said. The bishops also elected Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, a moderate, to a three-year term as president of the bishops' conference. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> who had been conference vice president since 1986. Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, past chairman of the bishops' Ecumenical and <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was elected vice president.

 East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> ousted the ruling Politburo today and replaced its aging members with reformers in a dramatic bid to gain control of a country convulsed by protests and the exodus of thousands of its people. The action followed Tuesday's resignation of the entire Cabinet and another round of street demonstrations involving more than 100,000 people in four cities who demanded the right to choose their own government. East Germans skeptical about the government's promises of reforms continued to flee their homeland today, with more than 50,000 people reaching <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Saturday. The entire 21-member Politburo resigned in a major leadership reshuffle, which opposition leaders and party members alike had been urging for days. It was <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s boldest move to get a grip on power since he became leader last month. The party's 163-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> then reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as party leader and voted in four new members to the Politburo, including <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, who have backed Soviet-style reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and six other members who support his reforms were re-elected to the ruling body. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> also was nominated for the post of premier, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The Politburo is the country's most powerful decision-making body. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approves leadership and major policy changes. `` Our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult development,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said in a speech to the Central Committee. He indicated that independent non-communist groups would be allowed a greater role in society. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said that provincial authorities in several cities were beginning to legally register New Forum, the largest pro-reform group. Later today, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> addressed a crowd of several thousand people _ mostly party faithful _ in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` We want a socialism that is politically democratic and morally clean,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hoped the dramatic change in the Politburo's makeup `` is a step on the road to stable and evolutionary reform.'' Today's action reduces the number of Politburo members from 21 to 11. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> re-elected to a Politburo seat <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, who has also become a leading reform advocate. The Central Committee also voted to appoint <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Chemnitzer </PERSON> as a non-voting member of the Politburo. <PERSON> Chemnitzer </PERSON> was the first high-ranking East German politician to suggest discussing the need for the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. In a brief dispatch, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> `` suggested'' the Politburo resign `` so that the responsibility for the current situation cn be made clear.'' Many members of the outgoing Politburo are in their 60s and 70s and are closely associated with <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s mentor, former hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The aging leadership had increasingly lost credibility, especially in the face of massive defections to the West. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, in office just three weeks, faces great difficulties as he tries to assert authority in a country that exploded in unrest a month ago as it marked the 40th anniversary of its founding as a Communist state. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has indicated no intention of releasing the Communists' grip on power He is under growing pressure at home and abroad to follow the lead of discredited Communist rulers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and share power. Before the Politburo action, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> urged East German Communists to surrender their monopoly on power, approve free elections and clear the way for economic reforms. `` With this condition, I am also ready to discuss a new dimension in our economic aid,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has several times offered <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> substantial new financial aid if wide-ranging reforms are embraced. On Tuesday, more than 100,000 people rallied in at least four East German cities after the resignation of the Cabinet, a 44-member body that has little power and implements policy made by the Politburo. About 5,000 East Berliners marched past the party building to demand free elections and shouted, `` Egon we are the competitors,'' and `` We are the people.'' The few police outside the party building did not intervene. Border officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said the number of refugees reaching <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since Saturday, when free exit through that country was first permitted, had reached more than 50,000. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is the only country to which East Germans can travel freely. The escape route opened Saturday created the first free passage to the West since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. Authorities have said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect, possibly before Christmas. So far this year, more than 190,000 East Germans _ more than 1 percent of the population of 16.6 million _ have moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by emigrating legally, escaping or failing to return from approved trips abroad. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> gives them automatic citizenship and help in starting new lives.

 A judge who told a divorcee she could n't live with her boyfriend and keep her child is out of touch with the times, observed a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice who said the case reminded her of `` <LOCATION> Harper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> P.T.A. Two high court justices on a panel considering an appeal by the mother noted Tuesday that it's rare these days for custody disputes to be settled on the basis of alleged misconduct by a spouse after a divorce. The mother, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>, asked the court to overturn an order by Kanawha County Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hey </PERSON>, who gave her 30 days to marry her boyfriend, move out of his house or give up custody of her 14-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. Hay issued the order Aug. 23 order at the request of Mrs. <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>'s former husband, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> They were divorced in January 1988. At the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Justice <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> said repeated court decisions have rejected the notion that cohabitation is grounds for removing a child from a parent's custody. `` It reminds me of ` <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> P.T.A. </ORGANIZATION>,''' <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> said, recalling the hit 1968 ballad of small-town moralizing. Justice <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said the notion of defining post-marital misconduct is impossible in modern society. `` How do you define misconduct?'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` Nobody in the world agrees on misconduct.'' The appeal said Hey rejected the recommendation of a court official known as a family law master because Mrs. <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> and her daughter live with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, though he and Mrs. <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> are n't married The family law master recommended that the girl stay with her mother. Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON>, who represented Hey at the hearing, noted there's a state law against `` lewd and lacivious cohabitation.'' If the laws of the state on morality are outdated, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should `` just say they are.'' `` Can you imagine any jury in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> convicting someone for cohabitating?'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> asked. `` You'd have to pick your jury carefully,'' <PERSON> Skeen </PERSON> said to an outburst of laughter. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>'s petition said she earns $ 80 - $ 100 a week in net income and can not afford to maintain an apartment of her own, the suit said Hey was out of his office Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of his cousin, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, as an appeals court judge is coming under fire from a prominent legal scholar as a violation of the law against nepotism in government. `` He would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the president's cousin,'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law Professor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said Tuesday at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 48, currently a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, drew no critics other than <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> at the hearing. The committee is not expected to vote on whether to recommend the nomination to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for several weeks, a customary delay. <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> told the panel that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` got this appointment because of family connections'' and that it `` violates the anti-nepotism statute both in language and in spirit.'' White House deputy press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said today, `` No law is being broken, period.'' He said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had received the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s highest rating. Under the 1976 law, federal officials may not name relatives to government jobs. <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said he thinks the statute covers the Walker nomination but later told reporters there was room for disagreement on that point. He told the committee that even if the law does not apply to judicial nominations, the <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> nomination `` violates the spirit of the law.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, elegantly dressed and bearing a slight resemblance to his cousin, sat a few feet away as <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> described him as an `` average'' rather than a distinguished judge. Once he shook his head impatiently. `` Judge <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s name would not have appeared on the long list or the short list'' if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had polled the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bar to find a candidate for the post, <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said. `` It should n't be enough that he is minimally qualified,'' he said. <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> once held an improper discussion with an attorney in a court matter growing out of the attempted-murder trial of socialite <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulow </PERSON>, who was subsequently acquitted. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> denied the allegation.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> today proposed curbs on late-term abortions and called for a requirement that girls under 16 notify at least one parent before terminating a pregnancy. The proposed changes in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' relatively liberal abortion law do not go nearly as far as those expected to be offered by anti-abortion activists after the Legislature convenes Jan. 8. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> law bans the use of public funds for abortions but otherwise allows abortion virtually on demand. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>'s Republican administration has been developing a position on the issue since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in July opened the door to more restrictive abortion laws. The court upheld a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law banning use of public funds and facilities for most abortions. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last month flatly rejected curbs on abortion pushed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved what would be the nation's most restrictive abortion laws; the legislation goes next to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> unveiled his proposals during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I believe the decision to have an abortion in the first 22 weeks of pregnancy should be determined by the woman involved and her doctor,'' he said. But he proposed that after 22 weeks a woman not be allowed to get an abortion unless her health is at risk, the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or the fetus is severely deformed. `` As neighboring states come to enact restrictions on late-term abortions, we do not want <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to become an abortion mill for the nation,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. Anti-abortion activists have said they will seek an outright ban on late-term abortions and on all abortions at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said the state should maintain its ban on the use of public funds for abortions but that outlawing all abortions at the medical center `` could have serious consequences, particularly for preganant women with life-threatening conditions. He said parental notification legislation would promote communication in families. `` Public policy in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> should support families,'' he said. `` In 35 other states, parental notification or consent laws have been enacted.'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodson </PERSON>, lobbyist for Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which endorsed <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> during his 1986 campaign, harshly criticized the proposals. `` What he's done is advocate the do-nothing position of the so-called moderate wing of the pro-choice movement,'' she said. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>, a Republican, endorsed <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>'s stand. He said, `` I believe the decision, whether to have an abortion, should be made by a woman and her doctor. I laud the governor for his leadership and courage.''

<HEAD>House Panel Concerned About Use of Trade Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern Wednesday about the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade sanctions to achieve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy goals, saying they work only if many countries impose them. The panel urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to try to persuade other nations to impose sanctions in support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to consider ending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions if they do not. The committee comments came as it endorsed pending legislation authorizing the use of trade sanctions against foreign countries and companies whose actions lead to the spread or use of chemical or biological weapons. Several committees have jurisdiction over the legislation, endorsed earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The House version of the bill requires the president to impose sanctions against foreign companies that have substantially contributed to another country's ability to make or use chemical or biological weapons. Other sanctions could be imposed against countries obtaining or using chemical weapons. The bill gives the president flexibility in choosing whether to impose sanctions and is generally weaker than legislation pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It gives the president authority to waive sanctions if he determines that doing so is in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in a policy statement that evidence strongly indicates that sanctions are most effective when imposed by many nations. `` Unilateral sanctions rarely have a significant effect on the target country,'' the panel said, adding that sanctions imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone place an `` unduly heavy burden'' on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters and importers and give an unwarranted advantage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners. `` The committee therefore urges the administration, if it imposes sanctions against a country under authority of this bill, to seek the timely imposition of substantially similar sanctions by other major producers of goods and technology which can be used to make or use chemical or biological weapons,'' the panel said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> pleaded guilty today to one count of lying to congressional investigators in the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had been scheduled to go on trial next Monday on 12 criminal charges, nine of them stemming from his testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. But at a pre-trial hearing, Iran-Contra prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> announced that the government and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyers had negotiated a plea agreement. The government will seek dismissal of the other 11 criminal charges against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who also could have faced tax charges, prosecutors said. `` No further criminal charges, including criminal tax charges, will be brought against the defendant based on information now known to the Office of Independent Counsel relating to the Iran-Contra affair,'' the plea agreement stated. Prosecutors were prepared to present evidence that `` Secord personally received ... in excess of $ 1.5 million'' in profits from the sale of weapons to the Contras and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in court papers. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> agreed to `` cooperate fully'' with Iran-Contra prosecutors `` by testifying truthfully at any trial ... to which he may be called,'' according to the plea agreement. He could become a government witness against former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, whose criminal trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and giving false statements in various investigations. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> has told the judge in his case that his daily meetings with then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included discussions of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s role as a middleman in the transfer of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is trying to subpoena <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s notes and diaries. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> flew with <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on April 20, 1986, after the two men reviewed problems in White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra re-supply network. When they landed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> met with <PERSON> North </PERSON> at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a former CIA-owned company involved in Contra re-supply, according to deposition testimony given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by one of the participants in the operation. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> admitted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court that he made a false statement when he told congressional investigators on June 10, 1987, that he had not been aware any money from his business dealings in the Iran-Contra affair went to White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that he had paid for a $ 13,800 security fence at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s home. `` I should have known that they were aiming at the fence,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said of the question by congressional investigators that led to his false statement. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said his answer was `` a misguided effort to prevent further criticism,'' noting that there had `` already been a firestorm in the press'' about who paid for North's security fence <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said `` I was trying to shield both of us'' when he lied about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fence in his deposition to the congressional investigators. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to five years in prison. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s profits for his work on the administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales and assisting the Contras `` exceed $ 1.5 million,'' prosecutors said in a recent court filing. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had been called into both initiatives by North. The government presented a document listing the evidence it would have presented at <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s trial in support of the charge to which he pleaded guilty. The document stated that in addition to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> paying for the fence, there was an attempted cover-up of who paid for the fence through the use of back-dated documents. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, objected to that portion of the government's evidence, saying <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had not been involved in a cover-up. The document also said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, had arranged to set aside $ 200,000 for an insurance fund for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s wife for the education of the North children. The document said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told North that the money had been set aside. In his congressional testimony in 1987, <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified that he knew nothing of the $ 200,000. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s deal with prosecutors was first reported Tuesday night by <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was one of the first figures in the Iran-Contra affair to cooperate with the congressional investigation. He was the leadoff witness in televised hearings in the summer of 1987 and testified without immunity from prosecution that was granted others, including North. <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> were the middlemen in U.S.-Iran arms sales. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, an expert in covert operations, also helped <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, set up a secret arms supply network to the Nicaraguan rebels.

<TEXT>
 Thirty-five years ago, <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> was selling wallets illegally on street corners, with a quick patter to attract customers and an eye out for the police. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a multimillionaire executive and controlling stockholder of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s second-largest TV network, now enthralls millions with his antics on camera. He also may become the next president of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country in the Nov. 15 election. `` I do n't have any plan,'' said <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 58, shortly after declaring his candidacy at the last minute on Oct. 31 for the country's first direct presidential vote in 29 years. `` But I felt the desire of the people. `` If the railsplitter <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the actor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as well _ and for two terms _ a street vendor who became an entertainer and businessman can be president of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted as saying in <ORGANIZATION> Veja </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s largest newsweekly. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to rule by Friday on whether <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' `` wild-card'' candidacy, as a substitute on the ticket of the minuscule, unknown Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Municipalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is legal. A spot poll by the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 2 showed the popular TV personality leading the other 21 candidates with a 29 percent voter preference. Two polls released since then put him in second place, with 14 percent and 18 percent, after center-right candidate <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> accused President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of trying to manipulate the election by backing <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who by law can not run again, deny the allegations. Although the president has not endorsed <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, he opposes <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, a former governor who has accused <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of being corrupt and incompetent. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abravanel </PERSON> into a Greek-Jewish working-class family in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, said, `` It's not my fault if the election fell into my hands at this moment.'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> sold odds and ends in downtown <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, watching for police because he did n't have a vendor's license. He later got the beer and soft-drink concession on ferryboats crossing <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Guanabara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and entertained commuters over a loudspeaker. Next came stints as a radio announcer and circus performer. In 1958, in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s biggest city, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> took over a business through which poor Brazilians without credit could buy household goods by making monthly payments in coupon books. The system, called the `` Trunk of Happiness,'' let people exchange coupons for merchandise. With it, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> turned his one-man operation into one of the biggest private conglomerates in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Grupo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silvio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> has some 50 companies employing nearly 20,000 people. To sell more coupon books, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> in 1965 bought TV time on Sunday afternoons and put on his own variety show in which he cajoled viewers into signing up for the `` Trunk of Happiness.'' When <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> decided to raffle off houses as special prizes, the response was so great he set up a construction company to meet the demand. He later bought an automobile dealership, sold auto insurance, formed a securities investment firm and went into the retailing business. In 1975, he bought his own TV station; in 1981, with the backing of the military dictatorship that then ruled <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, he became the owner of the SBT network. Running for eight hours every Sunday, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Silvio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>'' is a mixture of game shows and a beauty pageant. Polls show that <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' political support comes largely from the masses who watch his show and buy his time-payment coupons. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says that of 82 million registered voters in a population of 150 million, only 31 percent have completed eighth grade and 75 percent make less than the average salary equal to $ 36 a week. To vote for <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, Brazilians will have to draw an ` X' through the box next to the name of <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Municipalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate who withdrew to make way for <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. But first the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> must rule whether <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> is affected by a law that directors of government-licensed businesses, such as TV stations and networks, must resign at least three months before running in an election. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>'s lawyers said that although he is the main stockholder in the SBT network, he is not an active director. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francsco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezek </PERSON>, president of the seven-member electoral court, said the tribunal would rule by Friday.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Wednesday offered badly needed financial support to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> if the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership surrenders its 40-year monopoly on power. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> resigned in a major leadership reshuffle brought on by weeks of unprecedented unrest and an exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, in a state-of-the-nation address delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, warned the Communist government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> against trying to make do with `` cosmetic changes.'' `` We are not prepared to support a system that has lost its legitimacy,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` But we are prepared to offer far-reaching help if genuine and thorough-going political and economic reforms take root.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> urged the Communists to relinquish their monopoly on power, to legalize independent political parties and to allow free elections. `` Under these conditions we are prepared to discuss a new dimension in our financial assistance -LRB- to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made it clear that any such increase in economic aid would have to be linked to progress in establishing a more market-oriented economy. `` Without a dismantling of a centrally planned and bureaucratic economy and the creation of a market-oriented economy our help will be in vain,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said it was <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s `` national task'' to promote political and economic change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> already pays out millions of dollars in financial aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, including transit subsidies and special economic credits. New Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was reaffirmed in his post, and several prominent reformers were named to the powerful body. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has promised to introduce wide-ranging political and economic reforms, but the pledge has so far not ended widespread street protests and the westward flight of his people. Referring to the mass exodus, whose latest surge has brought 50,000 to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> via the Czechoslovak border since Saturday, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said: `` These refugees are voting with their feet against a system that has denied them their basic rights and freedoms.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the dramatic developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have showed the world that `` the division of our land is unnatural.'' `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB- Wall and the barbed wire can not stand forever,'' he said. `` These events have made it clear before the eyes of the world that the German question is still to be solved, because the people can not accept the present'' division.

 The president may order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents to arrest terrorists and drug traffickers overseas without a foreign nation's consent even if it violates international law, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday At a congressional hearing, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> defended his June 21 opinion that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has the legal authority in certain circumstances to go into foreign countries and arrest fugitives without a host government's permission. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief legal adviser, <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, supported <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s legal reasoning but outlined several dangers that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could face by engaging in conduct `` which departs from accepted norms.'' His comments reflected what one lawmaker termed obvious differences between the State and Justice Departments over the ruling. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> both said the legal ruling about <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrest authority did not signal any change in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> policy respecting foreign sovereignty. But the two officials outlined circumstances under which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s legal authority might be used to seize terrorists or drug traffickers who pose a serious threat to the security of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. `` The bottom line is if we find a terrorist, for example, who blows an American 747 out of the sky, if we find him basking in some safe haven, enjoying the payoff of his operation ... the issue is whether we have the authority under our law to go in an arrest him,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on civil and constitutional rights. `` In response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack, we would have good grounds under general principles of international law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a foreign sovereign's objections,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> told the panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif. The president may decide to arrest `` large-scale drug traffickers being given safe haven by a government acting in complicity with their criminal enterprise,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he could n't understand why such a `` very radical program'' was proposed when the number of domestic terrorist incidents `` this year and last were infinitesimal.'' `` I'm sure the families of the people on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103 will be glad to know that the incidents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were infinitesimal,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> replied, referring to the terrorist bombing last December of a U.S.-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that killed 259 people over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> charged that the legal authority asserted by <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s opinion would tarnish <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s reputation as the `` beacon of democracy. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> cited numerous court cases supporting the proposition that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could violate international law to assert its sovereignty as long as there was no specific ban in American law. `` It may well be that the president will choose to direct extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified in doing so as a matter of self-defense under international law,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, meanwhile, endorsed the idea that international law could be breached in self-defense to protect Americans from terrorists or drug traffickers who engage in terrorism. `` An act of self-defense is a justified act under international law'' and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, who has previously testified against legislation that would have given the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> the authority outlined in <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s opinion, warned of the political consequences of the ruling. `` We need to consider the fact that our legal position may be seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct against our interests,'' he said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> noted that the Iranian parliament `` has cited the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion to say that they have the same right to come into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to arrest their fugitives without our knowledge and kidnap them.''

The explosion shattered windows in the area and set least 10 cars ablaze in a parking lot 500 yards from a Syrian army checkpoint. Syrian soldiers fired shots into the air to clear the way for ambulances and fire engines. Residents ran to the parking lot hoping to save their cars. A young man sped out of the lot in a black car covered with shards of glass and hit a boy in the street. Rescuers put the boy in an ambulance. An ambulance with a loudspeaker drove through the streets urging people to donate blood. No group claimed responsibility for the seventh car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Thirty people were killed and 225 wounded in the previous six, by police count. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> arrived from Syrian-controlled north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane that landed an hour after the bombing. He was taken to an apartment building <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> owns at at <PERSON> Ramlet </PERSON> <PERSON> Baida </PERSON>, far from the explosion site. His route was kept secret. Syrian troops and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> riot policemen sealed the area around seven-story apartment building. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, was elected Sunday in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Parliament moved its session to Syrian-controlled territory because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> threatened to shell the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says the 40,000 soldiers <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, are an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. A six-month artillery battle between his forces and the Syrians killed hundreds of people and wounded thousands before a cease-fire stopped it in September. Sources said <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> would announce formation of a national reconciliation government by the end of the week in hopes of ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has cost more than 150,000 lives. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawi </PERSON>, head of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, threatened to kill <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for rejecting <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hawi </LOCATION> was quoted by the party newspaper <PERSON> An-Nida </PERSON> as saying his militia had other fighters like <PERSON> Soha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishara </PERSON>, who attempted last year to kill former army Maj. <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON>, commander of a south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> militia allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lahd </PERSON> was wounded and treated in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> have led competing Christian and Moslem governments since September 1988, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to agree on a successor.

 A former judge accused of escaping from a federal prison turned himself in, saying he thought he had been released. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON>, 74, surrendered in his hometown of <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. He said he had heard on the radio that he was wanted for escape, said Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mades </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md. `` He thought he'd been released from federal prison,'' Mades said. `` It was his understanding he had four days to find his way back to <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON> was to be paroled Friday _ the day he disappeared from the unfenced, minimum-security prison here, where he was serving a six-month term for mail fraud _ and was then supposed to be transferred to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> to serve a state sentence. He was a judge from 1971 to 1977 and then returned to private practice. He was convicted of lying on financial statements to banks, forging checks and insurance papers and stealing thousands of dollars from the estates of dead people. <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON> had a good chance of being been paroled from state prison in a month or two but now may face up to five more years if convicted of escape, officials said.

 Relatives of people killed in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 said the government assured them Wednesday it had issued timely warnings to airlines about the potential threat of a terrorist attack. Five Americans and two Britons, representing a group called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, are meeting with government officials this week to gather information about the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Group leader <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state officials assured the delegation they had transmitted two warnings of possible terrorist attacks to airlines `` in a timely fashion.'' <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state oversees security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, where the doomed flight originated. <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer, lost his wife in the crash. Group members said they would press West German government officials in further talks Thursday in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> about recent claims by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. The airline alleges <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities were warned by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 90 minutes before the plane's takeoff of suspicious activity in the baggage handling area of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport. `` There is no question there were numerous warnings'' about Flight 103, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammermann </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, resident whose brother died in the crash. `` Why was n't all this pulled together? That's the answer we're going to pursue,'' he told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, where Wednesday's talks were held West German authorities say they issued a general warning about possible terrorist attacks the month before the bombing, but denied there were last-minute warnings specifically about Flight 103. The relatives are representatives of a survivors' group that claims about 400 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 40 British members. The group already has had similar talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British authorities. <PERSON> Rosenkranz </PERSON> said the group was set up to press for airline security improvements and keep the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> case in the public eye. <PERSON> Ammermann </PERSON> said the talks with <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> officials were `` the most refreshing and positive'' so far. During three days of talks, the group also was to meet with the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor handling the case. After the flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, passengers and luggage were transferred to the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jetliner at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The plane exploded over the town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> after taking off from <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. News reports have alleged the bombing has been traced to terrorists of the radical People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has filed papers in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal court seeking access to any information showing that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities received the pre-flight warning about Flight 103. The airline, facing $ 300 million in lawsuits, wants a court order for documents and interviews at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies, along with any information the government may have about warnings before the flight.

 An anti-abortion prosecutor worried that state officials may back down and settle a major abortion-rights case before it goes to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lost a bid today to take part in the negotiations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordberg </PERSON> rejected a request from <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haine </PERSON> to replace the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' representative in the case. The judge said he saw no reason to make such a change. The abortion case, if decided by the high court, could open the door to more restrictive laws across the country. But a settlement would prevent such an outcome. The case involves a challenge by a clinic owner, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, to an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> regulation that he says requires him to build the equivalent of a small hospital to do abortions. He contends the regulation is a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the state are scheduled to argue the case Dec. 5 before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but have been talking in recent weeks in an effort to settle the case. <PERSON> Haine </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> it is widely believed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will uphold the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law and that the state is giving up the fight `` at the doorstep of victory.''

<HEAD>Gallup Poll Shows Soviets, Americans Weak in Geography</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young Soviets know more geography than young Americans, but citizens of both superpower nations do poorly at pinpointing the countries of the world, a Gallup poll showed Wednesday. `` In today's world, if you do n't know where you are, you are nowhere _ and clearly a lot of people are nowhere,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The Gallup Organization poll, commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The survey found: _ Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified 9.3 places of a possible 16 on a world map That score was the same as for young people surveyed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but below the West Germans and Swedes. The American average was 6.9, the lowest among all nations surveyed. _ Soviets as a whole identified an average of 7.4 places or bodies of water of a possible 16 on a world map, as did Mexicans surveyed Residents of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> topped the list with 11.6 correct, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 11.2, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 9.7, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 9.3, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> 9.2, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 8.6, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> 8.5 and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> 7.6. _ Thirteen percent of Soviet adults were unable to correctly identify the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on a world map, while 14 percent of the Americans could not correctly identify the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` Americans and Soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them,'' <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON> said, adding the result `` reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography in American classrooms.'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyenkov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the survey with Gallup, said `` it was a shock'' that the overall Soviet results fell short of Soviet researchers' expectations `` I did n't believe Soviet citizens know so little about geography,'' he said. `` I rechecked the data many times. The results were unbelievable. They will have very great repercussions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Upmeyer </PERSON>, a Gallup vice president, attributed the poor overall ranking of the Soviets to low scores among those over 55 who grew up during World War II without adequate educational opportunities. About 1,500 Soviet adults were surveyed in their homes last spring in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Kursk, an industrial city of 425,000 people 300 miles south of the capital. Respondents were asked to locate 16 places on the world map: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The Soviets also were asked to locate <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which borders it to the south. Nearly 11,000 people in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were tested in spring 1988 and the results were announced last year. Nearly 90 percent of the Soviets surveyed _ compared with 47 percent of the Americans _ said they had taken a course devoted entirely to geography. Only about a third of the Americans and Soviets located <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and only about 25 percent in each country pinpointed the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. About 40 percent of the Soviets did n't recognize the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, confusing it with the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. After the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the next most recognized country among the Soviets surveyed. Sixty-six percent of Soviets correctly located the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three-quarters of the Americans recognized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but fewer than half could find <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was identified by only about 40 percent of the Soviets and 30 percent of the Americans surveyed. However, 94 percent of the West Germans identified the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, compared with 88 percent identifying their own country.

<HEAD>Wall Warns Thrifts About Possibility of `Arranged Marriage'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal savings and loan regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> warned industry executives Wednesday that an `` arranged marriage'' with a merger partner might be the only way to prevent a weak institution from closing. `` Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy. Understand that,'' Wall told 3,600 delegates at the 97th annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of Saving Institutions, the industry's largest trade group Wall, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, was the closing speaker at the four-day meeting, the first major gathering of S & amp; L executives since the Aug. 9 enactment of thrift bailout legislation. In his speech, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> did n't mention the controversy swirling around his agency's handling of the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, expected to cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion. However, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay seizure of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> by nearly two years, saying he was legally required to keep it open unless it was insolvent. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> contends that <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> needed to determine only that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was operating unsafely and dissipating its assets. `` We were advised at the time we did not have the -LRB- legal -RRB- basis -LRB- to seize <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB-. It was the best advice we could find,'' he said. On Monday, Wall's agency issued new regulations requiring S & amp; L owners to back their lending with more of their own capital. The rules, required under the S & amp; L bill, are designed to provide a larger buffer of private money between S & amp; L losses and government deposit insurance funds. The thrift office estimates that about 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will fall nearly $ 20 billion short of the new standard. Regulators have identified 223 of those S & amp; Ls as likely candidates for government takeover. Many of the others will be able to meet the requirements by shrinking their balance sheets or retaining profits, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. The rest, about 300, `` must consider a merger or the reality of being acquired,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, warning weak thrifts not to be too choosy about suitors. Thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face closure. In the meantime, the thrift office will launch a vigorous `` matchmaker'' program, starting with a national conference next week, to help weak S & amp; Ls merge with stonger partners without government assistance. `` We are calling this our arranged marriage program,'' <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said, citing recent interest by Canadian and Japanese companies as evidence of the thrift industry's positive outlook. `` The worst is really over,'' he said. `` We have been through the fire and emerged tempered by the experience.'' Meanwhile, the new chairman of the league said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation may too narrowly limit thrift institutions to housing loans. `` While I consider myself first a housing lender, I also want to help meet other community lending needs, and I fear that -LRB- the S & amp; L bill -RRB- will restrict my ability to fulfill that role,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaton </PERSON>. During congressional debate on the bill, the trade association lobbied for the preservation of its business by arguing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs a separate mortgage finance system. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted a provision that will require thrifts by July 1991 to devote 70 percent of their assets to home financing, up from 60 percent currently. Industry critics charge S & amp; Ls got in trouble in part because they left their traditional business and risked depositors' money on speculative commercial real estate projects and other types of ventures they were n't familiar with.

But three years ago, he said, `` I attended this festival of musical equipment and found myself in my booth surrounded by 2,000 youngsters, most of them under 20. They were all knowledgeable and knew my Yardbirds stuff.'' He said he then had to wait until drummer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozzio </PERSON> was free to join him in a trio with <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hymas </PERSON> on keyboards. The group will appear Saturday at Madison Square Garden, the 12th stop in a 27-city tour.

 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> celebrated a razor-thin breakthrough as the nation's first elected black governor today, but his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent declared his intention to seek a recount of the vote. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was elected <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s first black mayor and said voters had responded `` with the voice of hope, here and in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> called a news conference to announce that if the official tally in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shows the candidates separated by less than one half of one percent of the vote _ a certainty based on unofficial figures _ `` It is my intention to ask for a recount.'' `` Let me first say that I congratulate <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> on a hard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have my full support,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> told reporters at his <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters. He said `` for the good of the new governor'' it is necessary that the public have complete confidence in the results. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he expected the official vote tally to be available in five days. The unofficial count showed the two candidates separated by 5,200 votes out of a total of 1.78 million cast. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> credited the volatile politics of abortion with being a major factor in his victory and dismissed suggestions that race was a factor in the narrowness of his margin _ a plurality still questioned by his Republican opponent. `` I'm saying it -LRB- race -RRB- is not and was not a factor in the results because I was elected,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> told a morning-after news conference in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> ran well behind the other two Democratic candidates for statewide office. The turnout of pro-choice voters powered an Election Day nightmare for Republicans that extended to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> reclaimed the governorship for his party and the Democrats regained control of the Assembly. `` It's a very tough day for Republicans,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> whip. `` Wait'til next year,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when asked by reporters about the election results as he met with Republican congressional leaders. As significant as the shift in abortion-voting sentiment was the extension of black political success in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s large city halls. Led by <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, blacks also succeeded white mayors in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` It's a good day for Americans,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` when young blacks and other folks all over the country can look at a Mayor <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a Gov. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and say there is a future in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> if you work hard and learn your trade.'' The main event of the day was in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> trailed <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> by 7,700 votes of more than 1.7 million cast in the unofficial, final vote count. With all precincts counted, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> had 889,869 votes or 50 percent and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had 882,137 votes or 50 percent. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> claimed victory, telling jubilant supporters in the capital of the old Confederacy, `` The people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have spoken.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> did not concede, saying, `` The race is not yet over,'' and he would await a final, official count. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said the race was particularily close because of a high turnout in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Notwithstanding that turnout, I still emerged with the majority of votes. I'm tickled pink.'' He called his election `` an excellent testimony to the people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, to the people of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short time.'' Both the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> races were far closer than pre-election polls had indicated, in keeping with previous campaigns in which black politicians drew fewer votes than predicted by traditional polling methods. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, waged a soft-spoken campaign that dwelled not at all on race. He replaces the often acerbic <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and will surely bring a new style of leadership to Gracie Mansion. `` This year voters rejected the calls of fear and voted with the voice of hope, here and in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said in victory. `` We passed another milestone on freedom's road.'' With 99 percent of precincts counted, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had 898,534 votes or 50 percent, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> had 856,448 votes or 48 percent, and two minor party candidates divided the remainder. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> offered the opposition a grudging tip of his hat. `` These were local contests in which the Democrats outcampaigned us and ran better campaigns,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` My hat's off to them, but I do n't think it makes much difference at all with regards to the 1990 campaign.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> saw things differently. He called the results `` a tremendously positive sign for us as we move into the'90s. It gives us tremendous momentum heading into 1990,'' when 36 governorships, 34 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and all 435 seats in the House are at stake. A sweep of the governor's races in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> would give the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 29 of the 50 governorships. The contest to fill the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat made vacant by the death of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> last summer was headed for a runoff between two Democrats, state Sen. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Most of Tuesday's action was in the nation's cities. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 71, won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, defeating 40-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>. Other mayors re-elected included <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who won a third term, and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, who coasted to a fifth in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> was elected mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, becoming the first black mayor of his majority-white city, while in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, City Councilman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> defeated busing foe <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> to gain a similar distinction. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> defeated his old mentor, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, in a bitter contest between two black Democrats to succeed retiring Republican Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>. The nasty tone in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was all too typical of the year's campaigns <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a 45-year-old former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, was unrelenting in his attacks on <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, calling the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president `` unfit'' for the office of mayor. But once the outcome was determined, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> called on New Yorkers to unite behind the new mayor with `` every prayer.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> trounced Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> to win a governorship held by Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> the past eight years. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> never recovered from criticism suffered when he tried to moderate his strong anti-abortion position. With 99 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> precincts counted, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> _ who twice before lost gubernatorial races _ had 1,356,957 or 62 percent. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> had 824,505 or 38 percent. It was <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s third try for the office and he defeated <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> by a margin of 500,000 votes out of about 3 million cast. The two candidates bombarded voters with negative commercials. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday's results proved that the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision opening the way for states to restrict access to abortion had energized pro-choice voters and that `` politics in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would never be the same.'' She contended that in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race, `` the issue of a woman's right to choose was so powerful it overcame all other issues.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, criticized Republicans, such as <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who tried to temper their prior opposition to abortion. `` <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> turned off pro-life voters,'' she said. As for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, she said, `` He probably could have handled the issue a lot better. He could have come out a lot earlier attacking <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>.'' Prominent black politicians hailed the results in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> can win in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the cradle of the Confederacy, black and other candidates of a new breed can win in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the South,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga. `` There have always been <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilders </PERSON> in the African-American community,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., the assistant <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority `` What is changed is that now the white community is looking beyond skin. They are looking at character and policy and leadership.''

<HEAD>House Panel Hears Computer Virus Testimony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ A computer security specialist estimated Wednesday that there have been up to hundreds of thousands of computer virus attacks against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations and the government in recent years. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> EDP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that the majority of incidents go unreported `` because there is not a high expectation of successful prosecution.'' Also, she said, `` organizations do not want to publicize their vulnerabilities when seemingly there is little or no benefit'' from public disclosure. `` The costs are staggering,'' Ms. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice. `` Viruses have cost corporations, government agencies and educational institutions millions of dollars to prevent, detect and recover from computer virus attacks.'' The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, asked her for a estimate of the overall number of virus attacks that have occurred in recent years. `` Is it tens, is it hundreds, is it thousands?'' he asked. Ms. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> responded: `` I think probably in the hundreds of thousands.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EDP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a 9,000-member group of electronic data processing professionals based in <LOCATION> Carol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. At the same hearing, the head of another computer industry association urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a cautious approach toward legislation intended to help fight viruses and other software threats. `` Like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s, these anti-virus bills could end up doing more harm than good,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickitt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickitt </PERSON> criticized three anti-virus bills whose chief sponsors are Reps. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herger </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, `` Outlawing some of the programming techniques used to create computer viruses might prevent the use of similar programs for beneficial purposes, including countering a virus,'' said <PERSON> Pickitt </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> CBEMA </LOCATION>, a Washington-based trade association whose member companies had combined sales last year of more than $ 230 billion. <PERSON> Herger </PERSON>'s bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prison on people convicted of `` interfering with the operations of computers through the use of programs containing hidden commands that can cause harm.'' The <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON> measure would punish anyone who `` willfully and knowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardware system or the associated software.'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s bill would make the introduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronic network a federal crime. Computer viruses generally are small strings of computer code that can `` infect'' legitimate computer programs and may cause destruction or alteration of data files.

 Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> claimed a hairbreadth victory that would make him the nation's first elected black governor, but <PERSON> Republican </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> refused to concede said he would demand a recount. Fewer than 8,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast separated the two candidates in the unofficial returns from Tuesday's election, which saw the largest voter turnout for a statewide election in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> history. Reports from the state's 1,967 precincts gave <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> 889,869 votes to 882,137 for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> called a news conference today to announce that he would ask for a recount if the official tally shows the candidates separated by less than one half of one percent of the votes _ a certainty based on the unofficial figures. `` Let me first say that I congratulate <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> on a hard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have my full support,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> told reporters at his <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters. However, he said that `` for the good of the new governor,'' it is necessary that the public have complete confidence in the results. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who also held a news conference today, dismissed a suggestion that the racial factor threw his election into doubt while his white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney general won substantial victories. `` I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the results because I was elected,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. Earlier, he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that his vote totals were a sign of the gains made by blacks in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's an excellent testament to the people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, to the people of this nation, as to how far we've come in a very short span of time,'' the 58-year-old lieutenant governor said. `` The people of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have spoken,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> told supporters Tuesday night at a jubilant rally. `` Whatever it takes, that's what I want to win by.'' But <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a 47-year-old former attorney general, did not accept defeat. `` This race is not yet over,'' he told supporters. `` We do n't yet know what the outcome is.'' `` This governor's race is too close to call,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a race that's going to be recounted. All we ask for is a fair and honest counting of the ballots.'' The difference between the candidates' totals was well within the 1 percent separation required for a recount, and possibly within the half a percent margin that allows the apparent loser to seek a recount without risk of having to pay for it if results are unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> will meet Nov. 27 to certify the results. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> then would have 10 days _ until Dec. 7 _ to request a recount. There is no timetable in state law for completing a recount. Observers could not recall a closer gubernatorial race, and the 65 percent of the 2.5 million registered voters who turned out also appeared to set a record. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaigned as the heir to two successive <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> administrations headed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, and Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who could not succeed himself under <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law. He noted that 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> electorate is white and cited this as evidence that race had not been a factor in the election. `` Instead of letting race be a factor they decided the reverse,'' he said. `` They believed in me notwithstanding accident of birth, class or any other demarcation.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who lost the 1981 race for governor to <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, said Virginians wanted a change and pointed to five tax increases in four years under <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. But the leading issues in the campaign were abortion and questions about the moral character of the candidates. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> took a strong pro-choice stand and charged that <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who opposed abortion except to save the life of the woman, wanted to set back the clock on women's rights. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> for accepting huge contributions from northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> real estate developers _ although <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> himself had wealthy backers, among them <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> identified as the richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Campaign reports filed by the candidates showed that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> had raised $ 6.46 million and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> $ 8.05 million in the third most expensive gubernatorial election in the nation's history, including the sums spent during primaries. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON>, president of the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said that if <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s victory stands it would inspire hope among the nation's blacks `` But I do not think that one night in this state can erase years of degradation and segregation,'' Gravely said. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a millionaire lawyer, grew up in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> in what he described as `` gentle poverty.'' He earned money for college by waiting on tables at whites-only political dinners in downtown <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, and became the first black to sit in the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> native who has practiced law in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> suburbs for eight years, has been out of office since the loss to <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>. A moderate in the state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, he was discouraged from running in the 1985 lieutenant governor's race by party conservatives. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> registered a net gain of four seats in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, a result that left Democrats with a 59-39 majority.

 Prehistoric humans may have raided the nearest pond when they got a hankering for leftover mastodon. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> said evidence he's uncovered at a pond in south-central <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> indicates prehistoric humans would make a bag from part of a mastodon's digestive tract and fill it with sand and gravel, making an anchor for the meat `` This is the first physical evidence documenting its use in prehistoric times,'' he said. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> on Wednesday presented the results of his work to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The Heisler site contains remains of a mastodon which died about 11,000 years ago. The remains are in clusters, some of which are surrounded by gravel and sand. `` Our working hypothesis is that the mastodon was killed some distance from the pond,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. `` Hunters would have quickly butchered the animal into manageable sections. `` Large portions of bone, meat and fat were then apparently carried to the pond, submerged and marked with posts shoved vertically into the pond bottom. After that, the kill site may have been abandoned to scavengers.''

 Actress <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> often spoke publicly of her struggle to save her adopted son from his heroin addiction, saying the battle was more traumatic than the cancer she's suffered since 1984. Now, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, 27, is dead of unknown causes. His body was found Tuesday in his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. `` We are awaiting the coroner's results, but at this time the case is not being handled by homicide detectives,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frio </PERSON> said Wednesday. An autopsy was scheduled for Thursday, although toxicology results likely would take longer, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's office. Miss Ireland recounted <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s addiction in `` Life Lines,'' a 1989 autobiography. `` I knew I wanted to write about <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, about adoption, about DNA,'' she has said. `` When you adopt a child, the birth mother is never out of the picture. I thought I had adopted the child of a married architect and a young Irish girl. Instead I had adopted a drug addict's child.'' Miss Ireland's publicist, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, did not immediately return telephone calls Wednesday and a call to husband <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>'s publicist was referred to Ms. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> The actress adopted <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> while she was married to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, who was perhaps best known for his role as agent <PERSON> Illya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuryakin </PERSON> in the 1960s television series `` The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' Miss Ireland and <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> were divorced in 1967, and she married <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> a year later. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is one of seven children they raised. Miss Ireland termed the battle to save her son from drugs a greater trauma than her breast cancer, saying in one interview: `` I can never forget the horror of learning <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> was an addict.'' Five years ago, the 54-year-old actress lost her right breast to cancer, and a year ago learned that the disease had spread to her lungs. Since the discovery of the new cancer, she has been undergoing treatment. As recently as last month, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said, `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is still fighting his demons.'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> made numerous unsuccessful attempts at drug rehabilitation but said in April that he had been clean for two months after spending one month in a recovery program. `` I just hope, in the end, it can help somebody,'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> said about his mother's book.

<HEAD>New Stadium Among Losers With Pay Hikes, Gay Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An electoral aftershock to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake wrecked plans for a new home for the baseball <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>, while voters concerned with less seismic matters dealt blows to gay rights, pay raises for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmakers and money for schools in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and their fans now face an uncertain future,'' Giants' owner <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> said after <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> voters Tuesday narrowly defeated a plan to build a new waterfront stadium to replace windswept Candlestick Park. The same voters also rejected a `` domestic partners'' proposal that would give unmarried municipal workers, both heterosexual and homosexual, the same funeral and sick benefits as married couples. And in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, voters reversed an ordinance protecting homosexuals against discrimination. Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Agran </PERSON> called the reversal on discrimination `` mean-spirited.'' But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` special protection for homosexuals is something we're not prepared to give at this point.'' The Oakland suburb of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> repealed an ordinance banning discrimination in housing and employment against AIDS victims. It was the first time a community held a referendum on ending discrimination against people with AIDS or the virus that causes it. Among the winners in Tuesday voting on local and statewide propositions were smoking curbs in tobacco country, tax money to help <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> lure the Winter Olympics, higher taxes to fight drug wars in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, more prisons for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and a new government for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> stadium vote left more questions than answers, but <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> was adamant about one thing. `` Candlestick Park can not stand as a longterm home to the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>,'' the owner of the National League champions said. He said the team would play the 1990 season at the reviled 29-year-old stadium. Where the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> would play after that was open to question. <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> said he would move the team, possibly to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, unless a new $ 115 million downtown stadium was built. Candlestick suffered minimal damage in the Oct. 17 earthquake, but blueprints for the proposed downtown stadium were less fortunate. Opponents of the new park said it was no time for the quake-damaged city to spend money on such a project. The stadium question was fiercely contested, falling 1,977 votes short of passage out of 171,487 votes cast. But the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> did n't strike out completely. Voters in <LOCATION> Scottdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, approved $ 8.4 million to build a new stadium and keep the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> from moving their spring training site to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The new stadium will hold 7,000 fans, about 1,800 more than the current park holds. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> voters also supported athletes, approving $ 56 million for ski jumps, bobsled-luge runs and skating rinks that could lure the 1998 Olympic Winter Games to their state. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, area voters approved a quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to raise $ 98 million during the next seven years to fight the war on drugs. The measure passed 60 percent to 40 percent. But voters gave thumbs down to tax hikes for education in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s electorate rejected two proposals to increase the state sales tax to generate $ 400 million for schools. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state voters soundly rejected a `` Children's Initiative'' to hike the sales tax by nearly a penny per dollar to help raise at least $ 360 million a year for smaller school classes, early childhood education, child-abuse and drug education The measure failed by a 70-to-30 percent margin. Elsewhere, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> voters rejected a four-cent property tax increase to subsidize the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>. The closest vote involved limiting smoking in some public places in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where the tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employs 2,000 workers and more than half the city's registered voters smoke. By only 173 votes of 29,809 votes cast, the electorate banned smoking in elevators and certain stores while requiring restaurants seating more than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats for non-smokers. The measure passed, 14,991 to 14,818. `` I do n't think it's going to cost you any jobs,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgins </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> to Alleviate Smoking Pollution. `` It's just going to give everybody a place of quiet enjoyment to go out and be happy together and get along.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the proposal to triple the current $ 7,200 salary of state lawmakers to $ 23,300 went down by more than 2-to-1. A proposal to boost the expense allowance from $ 30 to $ 81 also was rejected. But Texans, who had 21 ballot proposals to determine, favored the dropping of a 113-year-old provision requiring state office-holders to swear they did n't bribe their way into their positions. The vote was 2-to-1 to drop it. A $ 500 million water measure to bring running water and sewers to disease-ridden border towns was approved. So was a proposal to spend $ 400 million on new prisons to ease overcrowding. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> voters approved the most fundamental revision of the City Charter this century by passing a plan that gives the mayor more power, boosts the size of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from 35 to 51 members and abolishes the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>. The measure passed 56 percent to 44 percent. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> voters endorsed a non-binding ban on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s testing of Tomahawk cruise missiles over the state. The missiles are launched from submarines off the coast and fly as low as 500 feet off the ground. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> voters also approved a contingency contract to dispose of low-level nuclear wastes in Beatty, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>.

 Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> faces growing troubles as confusion spreads among East Germans who are tempted to join their friends and families heading West, experts and politicians said Wednesday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is fighting for its life like a drowning man,'' said an East Berliner walking past the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters on <ORGANIZATION> Unterwassertrasse </ORGANIZATION> 10 _ No. 10 Under Water Street. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, after just three weeks as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, threw out the aging Politburo on Wednesday and replaced the ruling body with reform proponents. But some said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> himself could be ousted unless he seizes the initiative. The conservative West German newspaper Die Welt compared <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and his men with the crew of a sinking ship. `` Water is breaking in everywhere through the rotting planks,'' the newspaper said in an editorial. `` They are grasping at everything to stop the leaks.'' <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the leader of the West German leftist opposition Social Democrats, stressed the urgent need for democratic reforms. `` A German Democratic Republic that is bleeding to death, whose supply system is breaking down and whose economy is failing wo n't be able to reform at all,'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will sink into lethargy or even chaos.'' There were questions about whether the Politburo shakeup would be enough to keep <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from veering out of control, especially since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> keep its leading role in society. `` Just changing a few faces is not enough,'' said <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON>, the general secretary of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The new politics has to take into account what the people of -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- want _ and that is an end to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on power.'' Backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other countries, the opposition has called for free elections. A leader of an East German political party allied with the Communists demanded a constitutional change to revoke the Communists' monopoly on power and urged free elections. `` We have seen that the current constitutional basis ca n't protect the country from instability,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> Hans-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Raspe </PERSON> Another allied party, the National Democrats, demanded <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> give `` proof of ability to lead.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, hounded by a lack of support among East Germans, has become a target of ridicule among the hundreds of thousands of people who have taken to the streets to demand democracy. `` Grandmother, why do you have such long teeth?'' read one placard at Saturday's million-strong demonstration in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> _ with a leering, grinning <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replacing the wolf of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. Most East Germans watch West German TV, which has given ample coverage to the democratic changes sweeping <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> just does n't enjoy any trust,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> dental technician who joined one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest single post-war migrations by fleeing to <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> with his wife and child last weekend. As the number of refugees approaches 200,000, there is growing confusion for those left behind. There is `` mental chaos'' as ordinary East Germans are torn between staying and fleeing to the West, said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Janning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mainz </ORGANIZATION>. `` The East Germans are confused about their identity,'' <PERSON> Janning </PERSON> said. The life they were accustomed to `` is breaking down'' with every departure. `` Suddenly they are forced to make a decision: Do I head to the West or do n't I?'' <PERSON> Janning </PERSON> said. `` It's one thing to dream about how nice it would be to visit the West and live there. It's another to be asked by your own children, ` Do we go or do we stay?''' For ordinary East Germans, there are the daily inconveniences of stores shut down because workers have fled, and the anxiety of knowing that the flight to the West has stripped the country of hundreds of its doctors and nurses. Opposition leaders note the country is losing the equivalent of a village every day as East Germans turn their backs on the Communist system. `` The people of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have unmistakably shown they wo n't be satisfied with cosmetic improvements,'' said <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> cabinet minister in charge of relations between the two German nations <PERSON> Janning </PERSON> said `` <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> is not a reform type,'' and warned that the new leader could be ousted within months if he fails to seize the initiative. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Boelling </PERSON>, the former head of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said the Politburo resignations were a sign of `` total helplessness and powerlessness'' and predicted they would fail to stabilize the growing crisis. `` I urgently wish that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, in the interest of millions of East Germans, would realize that he does n't enjoy confidence at all in his own country,'' <PERSON> Boelling </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state radio.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> began to replenish its coffers Wednesday after last-minute congressional action raising the debt limit averted the government's first-ever default. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 16 billion in three - and six-month bills in its weekly auction that was postponed on Monday because the government's borrowing authority had dropped to $ 2.8 trillion, a level its debt already surpassed The drop also forced postponement of $ 40 billion in quarterly refunding auctions and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the government would default if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to act by midnight Tuesday. Without congressional action, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> would have been unable to redeem $ 13.8 billion in bills that mature Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation shortly before the midnight deadline raising the debt ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion for the fiscal year ending next Sept. 30. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill Wednesday morning and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> rescheduled its auctions, starting with the short-term bill offering that afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday also resumed sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds and special securities for state and local governments, the temporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise in the bond market, that had been suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said the newly scheduled quarterly refunding will include auctions of $ 10 billion in three-year notes on Thursday, $ 10 billion in 10-year notes next Monday and $ 10 billion in 30-year bonds next Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> also said it would reoffer $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Friday. In addition to the note auction, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold its regular weekly auction for $ 16 billion in three - and six-month bills next Monday In Wednesday's auction, interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell to their lowest level since last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 8 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, down from 7.78 percent last week. Another $ 8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.49 percent, down from 7.62 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.52 percent on Oct. 23, and six-month bills averaged 7.42 percent on Oct. 16. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.93 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,806.10 and 7.89 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,621.30. The debt limit fell from $ 2.87 trillion to $ 2.8 trillion on Oct. 31 after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action raising the ceiling became stalled over Republican demands that the legislation also include a capital gains tax cut. That demand was subsequently dropped. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had never defaulted on its debt before, it came close on several occasions. For example, it had to dip into Social Security funds to keep its line of credit open in 1985. And in 1983, a delay in increasing the debt limit forced the government to exhaust its line of credit, leading to a suspension of savings bond sales, restrictions on deposits to the Social Security funds and cancellation of scheduled securities auctions. The national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of the decade as the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> was forced to borrrow more and more money to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts. The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $ 200 billion a year, but the deficit still totaled $ 152.1 billion in the year ending last Sept. 30. The Gramm-Rudman budget law, itself passed as part of a 1985 debt bill that put the limit above $ 2 trillion for the first time, mandates that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president reduce the deficit in fiscal 1990 to $ 100 billion. Fiscal 1990 began Oct. 1.

 <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, a virtuoso violinist who rode the roller coaster of fame from a dazzling high of winning a medal in the 1974 <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> to a dizzying low of a drug bust in July, says he is on the upswing again. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, 39, whose violin recital Saturday night in <LOCATION> Peekskill </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was his first public appearance since he was charged with drug possession and breaking into a motel room, said of his performance: `` I had a feeling of freedom of expression that I ca n't remember having had before to that degree. It seemed like the channels were really open from the emotions I was feeling through to the music.'' With the sense of starting with a clean slate, <ORGANIZATION> Fodor </ORGANIZATION> _ once dubbed the <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> of classical music _ headed Wednesday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> for a performance Saturday with the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>. From there he goes on to a three-night stint in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The performances were scheduled before <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s run-in with the law, and he said he is grateful no one canceled. `` In addition, I've gotten some additional engagements because people want to hear the new me,'' he said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home. An <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, judge placed the musician on three years' probation last month as part of a plea arrangement in which drug charges were dropped and <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded guilty to breaking and entering a motel July 27 on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> spent 28 days in a drug rehabilitation center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, and under the terms of the probation he is to continue drug treatment and submit to random testing. After the bust, many who knew the flamboyant violinist said he had trouble coping with his stalled career after such a splashy start. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s winning the silver medal at the <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> at age 24 _ no gold was awarded that year _ made him the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prize winner in that prestigious competition since <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> took the gold in piano in 1958. The post-Tchaikovsky Prize publicity painted the Denver-born violinist as an atypical classical musician, a young all-American Western male who grew up on a ranch and loved to ride, jog and swim. `` I had a lot of publicity that was n't of a very serious nature, which created an image that I was n't serious, which is not the truth,'' he said. For the first few years there were whirlwind engagements and television appearances, then his popularity began to wane. Critics accused him of playing only showy crowd-pleasing selections and said he lacked musical maturity. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said he feels better about his music now than in 1974. `` What other artists are doing in comparison with what I'm doing is not an issue with me any more. I'm grateful for what I have. I'm grateful to be alive. He said he remembers everything leading up to his arrest. `` I never blacked out. I went to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard to ride my bicycle. I stopped at 11 at night. I could n't summon the clerk at the motel. I rang the buzzer repeatedly. I walked in. The first room I came to was n't locked. `` I think it was divine intervention the way the whole thing came about. The maids woke me up in the morning. I could have left and not paid and not gotten arrested. I waited one and a half hours for the manager to get there. When she did, she had the police on the phone. I was trying to give her money for the room. I had over $ 100. `` I had cocaine in an aspirin container. I had a chance to throw it away. ... I wanted to go to rehab and I knew I'd never commit myself.'' Although authorities charged <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> with heroin possession as well as cocaine, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said the trace of heroin they found in the back of his car was n't his. He said he used cocaine for about four months before his arrest, and that he is shocked now when he realizes he played under the influence of the drug at the last few concerts before his arrest. `` The reason I got into cocaine is because I have the disease of addiction. I'm an extremely compulsive and obsessive person. It served me well in learning violin and being able to master difficult works,'' he said. He did n't abuse alcohol, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> says, because he did n't like hangovers. Now, said <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, `` I'm willing to accept what life has to offer. It was n't easy getting to this place. It is so rewarding. I'm enjoying life more every day I really do n't have any desire to have a drink or a drug. ... `` The feeling is a lot better than I ever got on drugs.''

 When <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was a boy, he would get on the trolley that ran near his <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> home and take a seat up front. Then his mother would make him move to the back. `` Her explanation would be one day this will all change,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a 58-year-old grandson of freed slaves who grew up in what he describes as `` gentle poverty'' in segregated <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, now a millionaire lawyer who has served the past four years as lieutenant governor, claimed a narrow victory over Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> in Tuesday's governor's race _ a triumph that would make him the first elected black governor in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. With only about 5,000 votes separating the two candidates out of more than 1.7 million cast, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> refused to concede and said he would ask for a state-financed recount. If <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is ultimately sworn in as governor, he will occupy an Executive Mansion just blocks from the once white-only clubs where he waited on tables at political dinners to earn money for college. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, one of eight children, set out on a career in medicine. He got a chemistry degree from <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly black school here, but then was drafted into the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and sent to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He earned a Bronze Star in the war, came home and found his job options limited. Sensing that the 1954 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on school integration would offer new opportunities for blacks, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> entered law school at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After graduating, he returned to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> to open a law practice and built a reputation in the 1960s as an up-and-coming criminal trial lawyer. In 1969, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> entered politics when one of the city's two state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats became vacant. He ran for the seat against two white opponents and won, becoming the first black in the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction. As a senator, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> allied himself with a group of young, moderate colleagues who were poised to challenge the body's established conservative leaders The alliance proved fruitful and the moderates took control. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> advanced quickly, becoming chairman of four committees over a 16-year career. He never faced opposition for re-election. But despite his insider status, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> occasionally took stands that were considered militant by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s political mainstream at the time. He fought for years for a state holiday to honor slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and he attacked the state song, `` Carry Me Back to <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' because of lyrics that blacks find offensive. The King holiday did n't become law until 1985, and only after it was joined with a holiday paying tribute to <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> heroes <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stonewall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The state song was never changed, although it is seldom sung in public. In 1982, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> threatened to run as an independent against Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>'s hand-picked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, who had angered <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> by paying homage to the once-segregationist <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> dynasty. <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> withdrew his candidacy. When <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> decided to run for lieutenant governor in 1985, he and fellow Democrat <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> again were at odds after <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> encouraged others in the party who were interested in the No. 2 office to run. None did, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was nominated without opposition and political experts said the presence of a black on the ticket spelled doom for Democrats. Instead, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and his ticketmates swept all three of the state's top offices. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> got 52 percent of the vote against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chichester </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>. As lieutenant governor, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s chief function was to preside over the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and cast tie-breaking votes. But he also used the office as a campaign pulpit by delivering warm welcoming remarks to dozens of groups visiting the gallery each day the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> was in session. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has been at odds occasionally with Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. He opposed _ after the fact _ passage of a 1986 sales tax increase that helped finance <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' $ 10 billion road-building initiative. But <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, as well as <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, stayed in <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s camp. And <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s only serious potential opponent for the nomination for governor, Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, decided to seek re-election. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> ran what he described as a `` <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> campaign'' that emphasized his `` new mainstream'' candidacy. He steered clear of appeals on minority issues and vowed to avoid letting race be the focus of his effort. `` You and I have a responsibility to make certain that what takes place on November 7 is n't something that should happen once in a lifetime, but something that should be expected,'' he told an audience of <PERSON> black </PERSON> college students last month. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who is divorced, has three children.

 A thirsty and hungry <PERSON> Abiud </PERSON> <PERSON> Upendura </PERSON> stood in line for nine hours on the first day of voting in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s elections, but he still had to return Wednesday to cast his ballot `` I'm OK,'' he said. `` I feel right because I want my independence.'' Voters again turned out in large numbers Wednesday, the second of five days of voting for an assembly that will write a constitution and make <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after 74 years. <PERSON> Upendura </PERSON>, 22, and many others camped overnight at their places in line or went home to sleep after failing to reach the voting booths Tuesday, when some lines extended more than a mile. The lines were slightly shorter Wednesday, but again the heat was sweltering. Helicopters are being used as mobile voting stations in some remote areas, visiting a different village each day. On Tuesday, 210,053 people cast ballots _ 30 percent of the vast, mineral-rich territory's 701,483 registered voters. `` Given the circumstances in this country, this is a mammoth achievement,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Namibian administration appointed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which captured the territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had resisted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to get it out of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1966, but finally agreed to grant independence under the world organization's supervision. No independence date has been set, but <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is expected to be free by early next year. Despite heat in the 90s and slow-moving lines, voters turned out in numbers almost equal to those of Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>. He said there were scattered incidents of intimidation and distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the favored party, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which fought a 23-year bush war against South African occupation. A territorial official said three children were killed when a grenade they found exploded. The territorial radio said a baby was killed and several people injured in pushing and shoving Tuesday at two northern polling stations. <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> could not confirm the death of the baby but that a child was among three people injured in one incident. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was very encouraged by initial reports that turnout was heavy and voting was proceeding smoothly. He called on all parties to abide by election rules. The election focuses on whether <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which leans to the left, will win two-thirds of the seats so it can write a constitution without consulting other parties. Its chief rival is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part of the transitional government installed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Seats will be allocated according to the proportion of votes received by each of the 10 parties involved. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, a white farmer who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said the South African government and news media decided in advance that a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> victory was certain. `` We are already fighting an uphill battle without it being made more difficult by South African assumptions,'' he said. Officials said the election could be extended through a sixth day, Sunday, but <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, spokesman for the transitional government, predicted that would not be necessary. Election officials hope to know the outcome by Nov. 15. The assembly is to convene one week after the results are final.

<HEAD>No Suspects in Murder of Pregnant Woman That Rocked Boston</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the corner of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, near where a pregnant woman was abducted and shot to death, there are now few signs of the murder that outraged the city. In the hours that followed the shooting of <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, police fanned out over this inner-city neighborhood in droves, questioning housing project residents for leads. But the trail of the person who shot them two weeks ago as they left a childbirth class seems to have grown cold. A lone police car cruised by a package store Wednesday. A group of teen-agers lounged on the steps of <ORGANIZATION> Fermoyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION>, across from the intersection where it is believed the woman and her husband were first confronted. `` There are all kinds of crimes that happen here,'' said <PERSON> Hibah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, 23, who was walking down <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. `` And these guys who live around here know how to hide very well.'' Police and city officials are silent, after a highly conspicuous presence in the days after the shooting. Police say they do n't want to jeopardize the case and have been told by the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney not to talk. `` We're not saying anything,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We do n't want the investigation played out in the papers. We probably wo n't say anything until there's a real break.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 30, a tax attorney from the suburb of Reading who was seven months pregnant, was shot in the head by a gunman shortly after she left a birthing class at a hospital near the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section Oct. 23. She and her husband, 29, were accosted in their car, probably while they paused at a stoplight, police said. The gunman forced them to drive a short distance into the <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> section where he robbed and shot them. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> called police on the car's cellular telephone and, in a dramatic 10-minute plea for help recorded by police, led them to the car where his wife lay dying as he lapsed in and out of consciousness. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> died after delivering the couple's son by Caesarean section. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, are at separate hospitals in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> is listed in stable condition and the infant is still in a neo-natal intensive care unit. Officials wo n't comment on his condition Police in Reading, the suburb 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION> lived, sent a detective to help <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police with the investigation. `` We are confident that they will catch up with this person,'' said Reading Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. `` People are still talking about it here and they're still upset.'' A 29-year-man arrested on an unrelated burglary charge a few days after the killing was questioned as a possible suspect. Police refused to call him an `` official'' suspect. However, he is still in custody following acquittal on the burglary charge Tuesday because a new charge of armed robbery was brought against him the same day. Residents around <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> have grown skeptical. `` They would have caught him by now if they were going to,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 18, a busboy at the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Restaurant Cafe, which is adjacent to the stoplight where it is believed the Stuarts were first abducted. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> residents are still frightened because of the shooting and `` everyone's pretty cautious. They're locking their doors. But you do n't see many police. There were a lot more here when it first happened.''

 Checks totaling $ 420,000 were delivered Wednesday by industrial tycoon <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to representatives of five <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> organizations as partial settlement of his sentence in a tax evasion case. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest in September 1987 to federal income tax evasion and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> placed him on probation for five years and set unusual provisions requiring him to help the homeless.

On Monday, <PERSON> Bonnici </PERSON> said his party will stage an anti-nuclear demonstration during the summit that will also demand a timetable for withdrawing foreign fleets from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said previously it was not ready to hold talks with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A national strategy for improving transportation in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was outlined Wednesday in a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. No new major federal or state spending program was recommended. But massive cooperative efforts by government and the private sector at all levels were urged, including a diversification of funding and planning. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, which issued the report, said the findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings going back two years and a national conference in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, in August 1988 `` From the very beginning, this initiative has been a cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural residents,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> added that the report will give rural transportation organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy development at national, state and local levels. Although no specific mode was recommended over another, the report referred to `` passenger transportation'' generically, meaning that it could include rail, bus or air travel, depending on the circumstances. The report said cooperation between public and private sectors `` is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the mobility needs of rural residents'' and that new approaches must be found. In mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation, the report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action. `` Communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer support for rural passenger transportation providers,'' the report said. `` Effective community participation can generate support for continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer support for rural public providers.'' Copies of the report, `` Reconnecting Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Recommendations for a National Strategy,'' are available from: USDA-OT, P.O. Box 96575, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20090-6575. For more information call 202?653-6305.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` greatly concerned'' that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may have provided <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with American technology used in a South African missile test, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Wednesday. As a result, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request to buy six supercomputers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be given special scrutiny, the official said at an arms control symposium on the Eastern shore of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` The request is being held because we are concerned,'' the official said. `` We are greatly concerned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could have transferred <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. technology.'' Questions have been raised over the years about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The official, speaking under seminar rules that barred further identification, acknowledged that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not know the extent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s relationship with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' But, the official said, technology used by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in last summer's missile test exceded the country's known capabilities. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told the cabinet last month that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had not given <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> any military technology developed or funded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The denial followed a statement by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that transfers of forbidden technology were `` taboo'' and that `` it would not enhance relations'' if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> develop a nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> had reported that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> provided <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> with know-how from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s canceled Lavi jet plane program, financed largely by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke at the arms control symposium also raised questions about a South African fighter plane known as the Cheetah, saying it was `` virtually a mirror image'' of an Israeli plane. Also, the official raised questions about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s program, known as Aarow, that is designed to defend against ballistic missiles that are proliferating in the Arab world. On a related subject, the official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not reached a conclusion whether <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> conducted a nuclear test 10 years ago with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> help. Earlier, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in a strong show of independence, would disband four of its 13 military divisions. Polish authorities also have notified the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it would not participate in an upgrading <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces, the official said. Two other divisions are being placed on stand-by, which means about 10 percent of the division troops will remain on active duty while the remaining will be sent home. The four disbanded divisions have about 40,000 troops. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> told the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> it was taking the steps because of economic necessity, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said at an arms control symposium at the Wye Plantation on the Eastern shore of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The official, who could not be identified under the seminar rules, said the Soviets apparently raised no objections. The Soviets also are in the midst of a partial withdrawal from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said last week that three tank divisions had been pulled out in past 11 months although some new artillery had been sent into the region <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are showing their independence in other ways as well, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. They are putting pressure on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on a reduction of troops and non-nuclear weapons across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Polish and Hungarian officials are speaking out and registering their views in the negotiations for the first time, the official said. Reporting progress on a 1987 treaty to abolish <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles, officials said the Soviets had destroyed 297 of their arsenal of 654 SS-20s. The others are due to be scrapped over the next two years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846 intermediate-range rockets covered by the treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week is installing a $ 38 million X-ray device at <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, the factory where SS-20 missiles were manufactured, to improve inspection of rail cars carrying other still-legal missiles from the factory.

 Victories by black Democrats in municipal and state elections signal a `` new direction for black politics'' and will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as moderates, several analysts said Wednesday. The victories `` will help set a new direction in black politics'' because black candidates were successful in many cases where the black voting population remains a very small minority, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was elected as the first black mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was apparently elected as governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s apparent victory holds up, he will become the nation's first black governor. Blacks also took control of city halls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor. `` One of the first sort of practical developments I think we'll see is more blacks taking a chance, running in places where blacks are not the majority,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who specializes in race and politics She said blacks chose not to run previously under those circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the candidates and their campaigns. Some analysts argued that the winners were forced to be moderate, almost to the exclusion of economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black candidates. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> noted that both <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> distanced themselves from the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, twice a presidential candidate. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dismissed attempts to `` disconnect'' himself from Tuesday's electoral victories. `` If, after the'88 campaign of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, there had been an increase in Greek registration, if you now had a <LOCATION> Greeek </LOCATION> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, no one would be trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so very apparent,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters outside the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Hilton Hotel. `` It was clear that the -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> forces were going to use me as the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> force for polarization,'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a reference to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s use of a black <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> is a campaign consultant. `` We stepped back strategically,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If we're members of the same team, does it really matter who scored the touchdown. If we're members of the same team, if we win the championship, all of us get the ring,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than easier times for black politicians and their base constituency. `` What we're going to have is that it's going to make it much more difficult for the black community,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a political sociologist at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called the victors `` clubhouse politicians'' who `` have said they are not going to speak to the black community while they assume their support.'' `` These people have taken a very cautious, moderate position, a kind of non-economic liberal position,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` I think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the white electorate for the really difficult decisions,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Of political candidates who still want to run on the platform more geared toward the poor, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` I'm not sure that they will see a lot of hope for that strategy.'' `` If they -LRB- <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> -RRB- could n't have done what they did, it really would have been a hopeless situation,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, also noting that many of Tuesday's victors are black politicians who worked their way up the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> structure. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that although both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> garnered support from many of the whites who voted for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1988 their successes Tuesday `` may show him he'll have to moderate it even more and change his campaign style.''

 Soldiers killed eight guerrillas in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the army reported Wednesday, and a newspaper said a former rebel leader who had served in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was convicted of treason by former comrades. Meanwhile an anti-drug crusading journalist shot three times by hitmen hired by traffickers died Wednesday from his injuries. Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> deplored the slaying of World Vision TV news director <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulido </PERSON>, who was shot Oct. 29 in his car in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` We will continue lamenting deaths such as these until we win the war against drug traffickers,'' <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pulido </PERSON>, the 46th journalist to be killed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since 1977, was the most recent victim of the war that began in mid-August when the government vowed to crack down on Colombian drug barons. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said the death sentence of <PERSON> Braulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> was suspended and he went into exile in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the guerrillas killed in two battles Tuesday were from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, one of six Colombian guerrilla groups. It said five were killed near <LOCATION> Bagre </LOCATION>, a town 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, and three near <LOCATION> Simiti </LOCATION>, 230 miles north of the capital. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> was a field commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 for the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which guerrillas organized as part of a peace effort by <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, then president of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. For years, the guerrilla group had controlled a part of central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> called the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION>, a stretch of about 200 miles along the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which runs nearly the length of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Paramilitary groups opposed to the guerrillas gained control of the area during the truce with the <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> government. The guerrilla leadership asked <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> to take command in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> and restore its dominance, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said, quoting four former guerrillas. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> had 109 combatants of a unit of about 200 guerrillas executed on suspicion of being army spies, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> quoted the former insurgents as saying. It said that practically destroyed guerrilla influence in the area and the guerrilla high command tried <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> for treason. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> did not say when the trial occurred. According to newspaper, the former guerrillas said a group of leftists they did not identify interceded to get the death sentence suspended. The pro-Soviet Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> was organized more than 30 years ago and is believed to have about 3,000 combatants.

 A man trying out his new videocamera may have taped the head-on collision that killed him and two other people, police said. A damaged videocassette taken from the wreckage of the Oct. 8 accident in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> shows some footage that apparently was shot from the car a short distance from the crash site. Investigators are trying to salvage more of the mangled tape in the hopes it shows the collision. Investigators said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharenbroch </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hollan </PERSON> may have been running his videocamera at the time the car's driver, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, lost control while trying to pass a vehicle and slid into the path of a second car, police said. The driver of the second car, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, was killed and his 12-year-old son, <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON>, died a day later. <PERSON> Scharenbroch </PERSON>, 26, died two days later from injuries. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, 27, was paralzyed in the crash. Authorities said the tape so far has not shed new light on the cause of the accident. <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beld </PERSON> said the footage stops several hundred feet before the intersection where the accident occurred and then goes blank.

<HEAD>Congress Clears Way to Act On Repeal Of Catastrophic Insurance Repeal</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved bills repealing the catastrophic health insurance surtax Wednesday in a parliamentary step that clears the way for conferees to work out a final solution. The carefully orchestrated action was calculated to simplify the parliamentary procedures under which the highly volatile issue will be resolved. The net effect to was to leave the two houses precisely where they have been _ substantively _ on the legislation since early October, but to clear out legislative underbrush. By having a free-standing bill to work with, conferees will be able to negotiate without the extraneous pressure _ time and otherwise _ of having their work attached to broader legislation. Several conference committee members have expressed optimism they can reach agreement by next week, clearing the way for final action on the legislation. Major new parts of the original catastrophic health legislation are to take effect Jan. 1, and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> officials are required by law to notify beneficaries of those changes unless they are repealed. The bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a unanimous voice vote followed word-for-word the language approved earlier on a 360-66 vote calling for outright repeal of the landmark expansion of Medicare approved last year. Likewise, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amended the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill with the exact language by which it voted earlier 99-0 to repeal the surtax but retain a small portion of benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action took less than one minute to complete. Prior to the agreement reached by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders Tuesday night to separate catastrophic health from other issues, the rollback legislation had been attached to a giant deficit reduction bill. There was an aborted attempt by the leadership of both houses on Tuesday to push conferees to reach an agreement that could be attached to a debt ceiling bill passed late Tuesday. However, conference committee members on all sides of the issue argued that the catastrophic health issues were too complex to be handled in such an expedited fashion.

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Casts Doubt on Cold Fusion Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Claims for the discovery of a new nuclear process called `` cold fusion'' raise some puzzling questions and are too weak to justify special government research efforts, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel said Wednesday. The group, in a report prepared for Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, said it found no persuasive evidence that the cold fusion process would produce useful sources of energy. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists last March first announced they had attained cold fusion, and the claim sparked worldwide efforts to reproduce the phenomenon. Some laboratories have supported the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> claims but most have not. Cold fusion is the claim that the decomposition of water at room temperature into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current passing through a palladium electrode leads to the absorption of hydrogen atoms in the electrode. The atoms then fuse to produce helium and large amounts of heat. If such a process could work on a large scale, it would make possible limitless supplies of cheap energy. The panel, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, recommended to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that no special funds be earmarked for investigating cold fusion and that the government not establish special programs or research centers to work on the issue. `` Nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century; it would require the existence of an as-yet-undiscovered nuclear process,'' the report said. The panel said it was `` sympathetic toward modest support'' for experiments with existing funds. This research should focus on confirming or disproving the claims that excess heat was produced in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> experiment. Separately, the advisory board said in a draft interim report to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that it doubted the potential for using a linear accelerator instead of a new nuclear reactor to produce tritium, a radioactive gas needed to make nuclear warheads. Scientists at <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> national laboratories and at <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse-Hanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state concluded in a report earlier this year that a linear accelerator could make tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely than could a new nuclear reactor. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, however, have said the accelerator technology is too uncertain to count on yet. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in August asked his advisory board to study the accelerator option. In a draft of its interim report to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the panel said that while an accelator would pose fewer safety and environmental problems than a new nuclear reactor, those advantages may be more than offset by the accelerator's need for large amounts of electricity to operate. `` It may be simpler, in fact, to use a nuclear reactor to produce tritium directly ... rather than have it, or a fossil plant, produce electricity to operate the accelerator,'' the report said. The panel plans to issue a final recommendation to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> by February.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, freshly elected as <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, hit the streets Wednesday to thank voters and start healing a city he sees divided over school busing and the quality of public education. `` I think there is legitimate anger and frustration in the city over education,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said before he began walking tours of downtown and residential neighborhoods to shake hands and greet residents. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, a three-term <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member, defeated his neighbor and one-time political ally, three-term City Attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>. With more than 99.9 percent of the city's precincts reporting, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> had 93,491 votes to <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>'s 67,276 _ a 58-to-42 percent margin. `` <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> can be proud of itself tonight,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> had told an election-night victory party. `` Proud because we're a thinking people, a thinking city and a city that cares and a city that lives up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it the most livable city in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 46, said he would try to form a partnership between city government and the schools to defuse tensions that rose over the `` Save Our Schools'' initiative, which sought to end mandatory busing for school desegregation. That initiative, which had become a central issue in the mayoral campaign, remained too close to call Wednesday, trailing by just 100 votes. The non-binding measure asked the city <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to halt mandatory busing of students for racial balance. In exchange, about $ 4.5 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for `` magnet'' programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment. With about 12,000 ballots still uncounted, there were 64,477 votes against the initiative and 64,377 votes in favor. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said he also wanted his walking tours to show he is committed to being actively involved in every neighborhood in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which has a black population of about 12 percent. `` I want to make sure this is a partnership where neighborhoods are rewarded for innovation and have police protection,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. `` And I think I can play a role and assist the school district where it needs it.'' <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON>, 43, said he might have lost because of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> affiliation in the strongly liberal, Democratic city. `` But Norm and I started the race as friends, and we went at it as friends, and we finished it as friends,'' he said. Rice will succeed Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, who served an unprecedented three four-year terms as mayor. He has accepted the position of director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> set out Wednesday to build a new administration, basking in his landslide victory for governor and the return of Democratic control in the Legislature. The Florio-led sweep gives Democrats the ability to redraw congressional districts _ and influence political power _ after the 1990 Census. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who soundly defeated Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> on Tuesday, was up shortly after dawn Wednesday to thank commuters at a train station. He then met with reporters and announced details of a transition team before heading to a scheduled victory rally with abortion rights activists. Abortion was one of the issues that helped <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, 52, end an eight-year Republican hold on the governor's office. Democrats, who already controlled the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also reclaimed a majority in the state Assembly. The governor's race was just getting under way in July when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave states more power to restrict abortions. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, who has a long anti-abortion voting record, took several weeks to remold his position and promise that he would not impose his personal views on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s largely pro-choice electorate. By contrast, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, despite an anti-abortion stance early in his political career, promised immediately to veto restrictive abortion legislation. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s sometimes unclear position was criticized by both sides on the abortion question. Anti-abortion activists accused the Republican of abandoning them for political convenience, while pro-choice forces never embraced his reformulated stance. Analysts and political loyalists said the <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> victory was largely a credit to the Democrat's nearly flawless campaign and evidence that <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> was hurt by his campaign's internal disarray, miscues on delicate issues such as abortion and his own conservative leanings. For <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION>, Wednesday was a day to count the casualties and wonder what ended the years of political dominance, popularity, and unprecedented party wealth under Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term. Democrats won at least five Assembly seats from Republicans Tuesday and will hold between 44 and 46 of the 80 seats when the counting is completed, reversing a 41-39 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> majority. Two districts remained too close to call Wednesday. In the governor's race, with all but a handful of precincts reporting, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> had 1,356,957 votes, or 62 percent, to <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s 824,505 votes, or 38 percent <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> promised to tackle high auto insurance rates as his first priority. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where motorists pay an average of $ 1,000 per car, has among the highest premiums in the nation. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s victory ended a 12-year-quest for the statehouse that began when he competed in the 1977 Democratic primary. In 1981, he lost to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by the narrowest margin in the state's history.

 Nicaraguan presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> met Wednesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to underscore his support for her cause and focus international attention on the upcoming election. `` I am looking to my democratic friends to tell them my desire for solidarity for the future'' of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, candidate of the umbrella group opposing the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said after the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> visited the White House as the Sandinista government said it would propose a new cease-fire to be coupled with demobilization of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would bring the plan to reinstate the cease-fire he called off last week to a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> meeting with the Contras on Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50 percent of the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people they hold. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> should have given the amnesty long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace accord he signed in August with four other presidents of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Contras should demobilize, she said, adding that the Sandinista government should fullfil its promises. Contra leaders met Wednesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials to discuss their approach to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks. The Contras were willing to discuss demobilizing their troops, said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Their conditions include full amnesty for those imprisoned in the war and several `` confidence-building'' measures aimed at ensuring secure conditions for those Contras who want to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is sending a 625-member border patrol force to stop Contras from infiltrating the border from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are being made to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

 Five teen-agers were charged Wednesday with raping an 11-year-old girl to initiate her as a gang `` queen.'' `` Queen'' is a term for a girl who has gained status within a gang by having sex with all its members, said <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s Deputy <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON>. The girl apparently was not a willing participant but was too afraid to resist, he said. The five, identified by authorities as members of the Gangster Disciples, were arrested Sunday in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> suburb. Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 18, was charged as an adult and that the four others were charged with being juvenile deliquents accused of rape. Three are 17 and one is 14. Deputy <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchannon </PERSON> said that to his knowledge none of the five, all students at <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, had been in trouble before. <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> said the girl was raped Saturday night in a <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> park. She was visiting a friend in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> and had talked on the telephone to one of the boys who allegedly assaulted her, he said. The five went to the house the girl was visiting and asked her to go for a walk. When she refused, they forced her to go with them, <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> said. He said the girl returned to her friend's house after the rape and did not call authorities or her parents. Residents who heard about the rape flagged down <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> and his partner during their patrol Sunday and told them about it. The deputies found the victim still at the girl friend's house and questioned her. Gang members usually try to entice a girl into participating willingly in the queen initiation, <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> said.

 Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable output this year is expected to exceed the drought-reduced 1988 production, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Wednesday. The overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest. Production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15 million tons, while potato output is estimated at around 370 million hundredweight. The output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is expected to be up 1 percent; mushrooms, 14 percent; sweet potatoes, 7 percent; and dry edible beans, 29 percent. Despite the strong increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable production, the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5 percent to a record level, the report said. `` Growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong prices at the wholesale and retail levels, and continued strong consumer demand,'' the report said. `` Most of the imports are fresh vegetables, which are brought in during the winter months when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production is limited to the southern-tier states.''

 Three major railways said Wednesday they will use mechanical shaking devices to replace some human wake-up services for locomotive operators to save more than $ 1.8 million a year. <PERSON> Masamichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawabata </PERSON>, an official of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said his company made the decision after the government's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> suggested that it and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> end wake-up services provided by outside agencies. He said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will spend $ 1.1 million to introduce the mechanical devices by next March. The devices inflate an air bag under the sleeper at a set time to shake him awake. <PERSON> Kawabata </PERSON> said 40 to 50 electric locomotive operators and conductors usually sleep in the same room but must get up at different times, and alarm clocks would disturb everybody in the room. He said that since before World War II, the railroad had employed people from a wake-up service agency who went about with lists of train schedules and bed numbers, waking up railway employees one by one. <PERSON> Kawabata </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with 83,000 workers, has 162 dormitories and 38 of them use the services of outside agencies at a cost of nearly $ 700,000 a year. An official of 50,000-worker <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his company will spend $ 1.3 million to install the wake-up devices in 25 sleeping rooms. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been spending $ 1.1 million a year on wake-up service agencies, he said. An official of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said his company also will replace the wake-up services with mechanical devices, but declined to discuss details. The three companies are among seven corporations formed when the state-run 277,000-worker <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> National Railways turned private in April 1987. The Board of Audit still looks into their business since the government still holds all stock in the companies.

 Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Wednesday he would demand a recount of the closest governor's race in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> history, but <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was already relishing the historical dimensions of his apparent victory. `` It starts coming home to you, something happened last night,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said at a news conference the morning after he claimed victory as the nation's first black elected governor. Just what happened was not absolutely certain, although <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> still clung to a lead of 5,500 votes out of more than 1.7 million cast. With all 1,967 precincts reporting, unofficial results showed <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> with 896,283 votes to <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s 890,750 votes. Because the margin was within one-half of 1 percent, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had the right under state law to demand a recount. At a news conference in <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, he said he would do so. `` The outcome, although still in doubt, has given me a responsibility, for plainly I am the trustee of the votes of more than 880,000 Virginians who supported me in this contest. I have a responsibility to them and to all Virginians to ensure the person with the most votes is declared the winner,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` I congratulate <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> on a hard-fought campaign and if he is certified the winner, he will have my full support,'' he added. But, he continued, `` For the good of the next governor, whoever he may be, and for the good of the commonwealth, it is essential that there be complete confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the results.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> will meet Nov. 27 to certify the results of Tuesday's vote, which board Secretary <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz-Hugh </PERSON> said was the closest contest for governor ever in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> will have until Dec. 7 to request a recount. Mrs. <PERSON> Fitz-Hugh </PERSON> said as far as she knew, no such recount had ever been conducted in a statewide election. She had no estimate of how long it would take to tally the votes a second time. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney general, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, both won by substantial margins, prompting questions about the role that race played in the campaign. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> dismissed such speculation, saying the election answered `` the subliminal question'' about the importance of race. `` I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the results because I was elected,'' he said. `` I said if I won by 50.1 percent of the vote, I'd be happy. That's why you see me happy.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> also dismissed questions about whether people were saying one thing in pre-election polls and exit polls, all of which showed him leading by a comfortable margin, and then voting a different way. The same polls showed <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> well behind his Republican opponent, <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> won 54 percent to 46 percent. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> also said he intended to serve as a full-time governor rather than get involved in national Democratic politics as a potential black rival to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do n't think you're going to see me being in confrontation with anybody,'' he said. However, he added that if he were asked and had the time, he would campaign for Democrats in other states. He also would not rule out a bid for federal office in the future. He said his victory showed national party leaders that `` Democrats do n't need to make special appeals to special groups'' because mainstream candidates can win. `` The mandate is that in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, we are prepared to move and we do n't care what that person looks like,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who used <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s opposition to abortion in television advertising, said it would be wrong to say that his candidacy was based on that single issue. But he said the vote showed that Virginians want to move forward rather than `` turn the clock back'' to when abortions were illegal. And he criticized President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to veto Medicaid funding for abortions.

<TEXT>
 The AP tally of votes in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> gubernatorial race erroneously gave Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> between 5,000 and 18,000 more votes than he actually had for about an hour Tuesday night. At no point in the count of more than 1.7 million votes cast did the bulge change who was ahead. The AP figures were based on unofficial reports from county clerks. The problem was caused by double-counting of returns from a small group of heavily black precincts. The returns from the precincts were being gathered as a special project to provide information on black voting patterns in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> contest. The precinct returns were to be kept separate from the county-level tabulation in the AP election computer, but they were not. Since <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was running up large margins in the heavily black precincts, double-counting inflated <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s margin over Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The degree of the inflation varied during the period involved _ from about 8:45 p.m. EST until 9:55 p.m. EST. Exact numbers by which the vote was inflated varied through the hourlong period from 5,000 votes to 18,000 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> conducted a complete recanvass of all 136 jurisdictions in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on Wednesday to gather final, unofficial returns on the race. With all those jurisdictions rechecked, the count showed <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> with a lead of about 5,500 votes. He had 896,283 votes or 50 percent to <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s 890,750 votes or 50 percent.

 Supporters of a measure to ban discrimination against people with AIDS said Wednesday they lost at the polls because of a well-organized, anti-gay campaign led by Christian fundamentalists. `` The gay community has been confronted with fundamentalists for three years out here and this was the first test at the polls,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitsell </PERSON>, who blamed the repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance on people who had a `` homophobic reaction to what should've been a health issue.'' <PERSON> Whitsell </PERSON> also blamed the defeat on apathy. `` I am disappointed in the city,'' he said. `` I am disappointed in the people who did not get out and vote.'' In a measure widely seen as a test of support for gay rights, voters in this city of 100,000 about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> passed Measure D, which repealed an ordinance designed to protect AIDS victims from discrimination in housing or employment.

<TEXT>
 Having toilets to flush and safe water to drink will help end Third World conditions in the impoverished `` colonias'' along the Mexican border, community activists celebrating voter approval of a water plan said Wednesday. Seven years of organizing and lobbying paid off with Tuesday's passage of Proposition 2, said <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerma </PERSON>, a leader of <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 36 churches in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> A network of church-based groups throughout the state have pushed for improved conditions in the substandard rural subdivisions for years, including the statewide water amendment. Two things most Americans take for granted _ drinking water and sewer lines _ will arrive for the first time for thousands of colonia residents, Mrs. <PERSON> Lerma </PERSON> said. `` Peope will have toilets to flush,'' she said. `` It's not a joke. This will make a big difference in people's lives.'' Sewer systems particularly will help curb the incidence of such `` Third World'' diseases as hepatitis, tuberculosis, dysentery and other gastrointestinal illnesses in the colonias, Mrs. <PERSON> Lerma </PERSON> said. The amendment authorizes a $ 500 million bond package for water projects, sewer systems and flood control statewide. The colonias are to get $ 100 million of the bond revenues. The measure passed by a vote of 686,475, or 60 percent, to 462,582, or 40 percent, of the ballots cast. More than 100,000 people are estimated to be living in colonias, which often are carved out of farmland by real estate developers who offer homes for down payments of as low as $ 100, but never install adequate water, sewers, streets or drainage. Outhouses in back yards are common sights in colonias. Most homes have drinking water but it is not unusual for the water system to be contaminated or limited to a single outdoor faucet in the front yards. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milpas </LOCATION>, a colonia south of <LOCATION> Pharr </LOCATION> in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> for more than 30 years, said Wednesday that the amendment's passage reminded her of the biblical story of a man who said he could die contented after seeing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` Last night, I went to church and I told God, ` Thank you, but I do n't want to die. I want to keep working,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, who spent Tuesday hauling colonia residents to the polls in a tiny <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevette </LOCATION>. `` My greatest desire was that our children have water, so they could bathe and go to school without being covered with dust from the streets and being rejected by the other children,'' she said.

 The tide may be turning in the battle to save the African elephant, witnesses told a congressional hearing Wednesday. `` For the first time in many years there is hope and confidence that the species' precipitous decline can be stemmed and even reversed in much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON>, senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must do more, including increasing its spending for anti-poaching measures in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Bohlen </LOCATION> and other conservationists testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation. `` It has been bitterly disappointing to me to see how little money <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated to the African Elephant Conservation Fund: a paltry $ 350,000 for this fiscal year,'' <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON> said. `` That amount will not save many elephants,'' he added. Witnesses said worldwide recognition of the plight of the African elephant has begun to have an impact on poaching, which has been decimating the population for years. Agreements by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to ban ivory imports and anti-poaching actions in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have been crucial to the effort. Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee, said merely declaring the elephant an endangered species is not enough `` Our goal is not simply to save a few elephants here and there for zoos and parks,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. `` Our objective must be to restore elephant populations; to work with the international community and with the nations of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to bring those populations back up to sustainable levels; to provide a source of income for countries in desperate need of revenue.'' Witnesses said that the banning of ivory trade has in some instances already had an impact on poaching by reducing the market for ivory. `` The absence of market demand and stepped-up enforcement efforts have combined to greatly reduce the toll on elephants,'' <PERSON> Bohlen </PERSON> said. `` Ivory presently has no value in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> where 1,840 poachers and traders have been arrested. Incredibly, tusks have been found washing down the <LOCATION> Ruaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, dumped by culprits who no longer can sell them.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said disagreements among African countries _ some of which do not consider their elephant populations endangered _ must be settled before more progress can be made. She also said steps must be taken to curb recreational hunting despite arguments that costly hunting licenses provide revenue to protect elephant herds. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said the international agreements on banning trade and helping to fight poaching mark significant progress in the past year. `` The African Elephant has been granted a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge Wednesday prohibited anti-abortion protesters from blocking half a dozen abortion clincs in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON> issued the preliminary injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, which plan demonstrations the next two weekends in the nation's capital.

<HEAD>Airline Reregulation Emerges In Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Airline officials told a congressional panel Wednesday that proposals that could lead to reregulation of the industry would hurt service rather than improve it. `` The message I hear is that we are free to be innovative, free to risk capital, free to compete, as long as we lose money,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s aviation subcommittee. `` If we are successful, the rug is likely to be pulled out from under us,'' he said. The subcommittee heard testimony on a bill that would alter several practices sponsors say have driven small airlines out of business and kept others from starting up. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, meanwhile, introduced the Airline Reregulation Act that would go much further, allowing the government once again to regulate fares, routes and services. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deregulated the industry in 1978. `` I do n't know if complete reregulation is the answer,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said in announcing the bill. `` But I do know it's time we owned up to the fact that airline deregulation was a mistake.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> was the lead-off witness before the subcommittee, which was discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also would reregulate. That proposal, sponsored by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., would force big airlines to give up their computerized reservations systems, stop them from booking flights on smaller airlines as if they are their own, end the selling of slots at major airports and strengthen the government's hand to increase `` Instead of a proliferation of choices, consumers are increasingly faced with little or no choice,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said about airline service. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, however, told the committee the proposals would `` diminish, not enhance, competition.'' He acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines who own them a competitive advantage, but denied that was because of anything built into the systems provided to travel agents for booking all their flights. `` Why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned?'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> asked. He said that rather than trying to restrict successful airlines, the government should concentrate on building more airports and other facilities to increase competition. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callison </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce increased air fares. <PERSON> Callison </PERSON> said a provision of the bill that would prevent airlines from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish airlines that have not taken over smaller carriers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s connection carriers operate as independent companies, not owned by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, and are major examples of small business at its best,'' he said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, chief executive of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, indicated general support for the bill and suggested it also call for an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> investigation of frequent flyer programs. `` These programs, although quite popular, are among the most antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. He noted that while businesses often pay for the original tickets, employees can use the frequent flyer bonus without being taxed for the benefit. `` The programs do not promote new business, they simply allow airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are already receiving,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, including <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, award flights and other benefits for customers who regularly fly with them.

 Victories by black Democrats in municipal and state elections signal a `` new direction for black politics'' and will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as moderates, several analysts said Wednesday. The victories `` will help set a new direction in black politics'' because black candidates were successful in many cases where the black voting population remains a very small minority, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was elected as the first black mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was apparently elected as governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s apparent victory holds up, he will become the nation's first black governor. Blacks also took control of city halls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor. `` One of the first sort of practical developments I think we'll see is more blacks taking a chance, running in places where blacks are not the majority,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who specializes in race and politics She said blacks chose not to run previously under those circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the candidates and their campaigns. Some analysts argued that the winners were forced to be moderate, almost to the exclusion of economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black candidates. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> noted that both <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> distanced themselves from the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, twice a presidential candidate. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dismissed attempts by others to `` disconnect'' him from Tuesday's electoral victories. `` If, after the'88 campaign of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, there had been an increase in Greek registration, if you now had a <LOCATION> Greeek </LOCATION> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, no one would be trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so very apparent,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters outside the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Hilton Hotel. `` It was clear that the -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> forces were going to use me as the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> force for polarization,'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a reference to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s use of a black <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> is a campaign consultant. `` We stepped back strategically,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` If we're members of the same team, does it really matter who scored the touchdown. If we're members of the same team, if we win the championship, all of us get the ring,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Saying that many of Tuesday's winners were `` either delegates of our campaign or voters for our campaign,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had won the 1988 Democratic presidential primary in all the areas where black candidates were successful Tuesday. `` In many ways, the electorate yesterday was less sexist and less racist and more fair and more mature than ever before in American history,'' he said. Other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than easier times for black politicians and their base constituency. `` What we're going to have is that it's going to make it much more difficult for the black community,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a political sociologist at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called the victors `` clubhouse politicians'' who `` have said they are not going to speak to the black community while they assume their support.'' `` These people have taken a very cautious, moderate position, a kind of non-economic liberal position,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` I think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the white electorate for the really difficult decisions,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Of political candidates who still want to run on the platform more geared toward the poor, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` I'm not sure that they will see a lot of hope for that strategy.'' `` If they -LRB- <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> -RRB- could n't have done what they did, it really would have been a hopeless situation,'' said <PERSON> Willims </PERSON>, also noting that many of Tuesday's victors are black politicians who worked their way up the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> structure. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that although both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> garnered support from many of the whites who voted for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1988 their successes Tuesday `` may show him he'll have to moderate it even more and change his campaign style.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> told senators on Wednesday that a recent decision to permit Hondurans to vote by simply flashing an identity card opens the door to election fraud. <PERSON> Cresencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 45, a Texas-born career diplomat, commented in response to questions during confirmation hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> gave the thumbs-up sign Wednesday to hundreds of people who welcomed him to City Hall, where he will begin work in January as the first black mayor of the nation's most populous city. `` Frankly, I'm flabbergasted!'' he said. `` I was very surprised to find so many people. I'm delighted.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' first day after defeating <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> by fewer than 50,000 votes was spent getting acquainted with his workplace. He met with Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and then said at a news conference that he might not have won without the immediate support <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> gave him after <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> defeated the three-term mayor in a September primary. With all but three of the city's 5,237 precincts reporting, the unofficial count showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with 898,900 votes, or 50 percent, while <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a former federal prosecutor who ran as a reformer, had 856,450 votes, or 48 percent. Conservative and Right to Life candidates each had 1 percent. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, 62, said he recognized the importance of his role in history. `` Clearly, I see myself as a person who has the privilege of representing a large number of people, not just in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but across the country, who are African-Americans. And I am very proud to accept that,'' he said. `` But there's also leadership of the largest, most important and greatest urban center in the world and they really go hand in hand. If I can do my job well, then African-Americans across this land will be proud that I have done that,'' he said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he'll fall behind the curtain gracefully but hinted he will stay in the wings. `` I'm going to differ with him on occasion _ privately in the beginning, publicly later on,'' he said. `` I loved being the mayor but it's not the whole <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>,'' he added. `` I have other facets to my personality which you will soon see,'' he said. The same might be said about <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. Some Republicans _ and at least one prominent Democrat _ said they would n't be surprised to see the former prosecutor challenge Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> next year. `` If I was <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, I would be worried,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, a wealthy Democrat who worked in the administration of former Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. Democratic consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> also said he was impressed by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` He got 48 percent in a Democratic city, against a 5-1 registration edge, up against every leading light of the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. His reference was to the high-level assistance <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> received during the campaign from <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and others. But Wednesday was a day for celebration by people with less prominent names as well. On the streets of the city, from subways to stores to hotels to the steps of City Hall, people like 29-year-old <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and 32-year-old <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> were talking about tiny differences they already perceived in their city as a result of <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' victory. `` I do feel there's a new respect,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who is black. Noting that taxis often refuse to pick up black people, she recalled how a friend told her early Wednesday as they emerged from <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' victory celebration, `` Oh, we wo n't have any problems getting a taxi tonight.'' `` Actually, we did get a cab like that last night,'' she said with a laugh and a snap of her fingers.

 A non-binding ballot question declaring English the official language of <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> passed overwhelmingly over the objections of minority groups who fear it could jeopardize federal funds. The measure, which passed Tuesday by a vote of 14,575 to 5,679, was strongly opposed by minorities in a city of about 100,000 that is home to 25,000 Hispanics and Asians. School Committeeman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouloheras </PERSON> proposed the measure, not as a statement against minorities, he said, but to determine the support for a common tongue. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been enriched by the cultural contributions of immigrants with many traditions, but blessed with one common language that has united a diverse nation and fostered harmony among its people,'' <PERSON> Kouloheras </PERSON> said in statement.

<HEAD>Eds: State Oil Spill Liability Laws Preserved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Wednesday preserved the states' ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability laws than the federal government in a move environmentalists called a victory and the oil industry wants vetoed `` This is a fundamental right of the states,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who along with Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., led the fight to maintain existing state discretion against the oil industry's call for Their effort was approved by a 279-143 vote that inserted the provision into a massive bill that determines how oil spill cleanups will be financed and managed. A vote on the whole bill is expected Thursday. The legislative package has been in the works for years, but was pushed to the forefront after the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground last spring in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil into the pristine waterway. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> called the action `` very significant'' and a victory for environmentalists. `` This is one of the biggest environmental votes this year,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> lobbied heavily against the provision and said it would urge a presidential veto if it is not changed in a conference committee. The oil spill liability legislation passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also allows states to have tougher laws. This is the first time in 14 years of considering such measures that the House has gone along with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in adopting an explicit recognition of state discretion. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has never prohibited the states from adopting stricter laws. Twenty-eight states have their own oil spill liability statutes. Nineteen set no limits on the amount that should be spent by oil companies or carriers for cleaning up damaged environments. A key concern raised during <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate was whether the insurance costs for transporting oil would be prohibitively high if states continue to demand more money from the oil companies and carriers for spills. `` Operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may feel it's not worth the legal risks,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Home heating oil may suddenly disappear.'' `` Before the Valdez oil spill we had not seen a spill that created more than $ 100 million to $ 200 million worth of damage,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Del </LOCATION>. `` It's not going to be easy to get insurance in the future.'' A $ 2 billion price tag has been put on the Exxon Valdez cleanup. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan is adopted into law many responsible transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers,'' said the petroleum institute. The states' right to pre-empt the federal statute was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> and environmental organizations.

 Communist Party chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> swept the old guard from the ruling Politburo in a desperate attempt Wednesday to stem flight to the West, appease pro-democracy protesters and strengthen his 3-week-old leadership. East Germans disillusioned by 40 years of rigid rule and skeptical of promises continued leaving in droves. Pro-reform groups pleaded with their countrymen to stay and help `` build a real democratic society,'' but more than 50,000 had arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> made a stinging attack on his predecessor and mentor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, and Communist authorities took the first steps toward registering New Forum, the nation's largest pro-democracy group. Officials in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> an der <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> legalized New Forum locally and the local <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, a small party previously allied with the Communists, gave them space in its building, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. The party propaganda chief said free elections might be possible. ADN said 25,000 people in <LOCATION> Neubrandenburg </LOCATION> rallied for free elections, greeting the leadership's decisions with whistles, and 15,000 protested in <LOCATION> Limbach-Oberfrohna </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Karl-Marx-Stadt </LOCATION>. `` Our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult development,'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which unanimously approved his proposal to dissolve the 21-member Politburo and form a smaller one. Central Committee members reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, as party leader and announced the election of an 11-member Politburo. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and six other Politburo members were re-elected. Four new members chosen for the Politburo, the nation's most powerful body, included <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, the 61-year-old <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> party chief said to be a leading advocate of reform. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was proposed for the post of premier, which has been empty since Tuesday's resignation of Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, 75, and the entire Council of Ministers, or Cabinet. Parliament's presidium was to meet Thursday to set a date to elect a new Cabinet. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hoped the shakeup `` is a step on the road to stable and evolutionary reform.'' The aging Politburo members dropped were closely associated with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, whom <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced Oct. 18. They included <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>; ideology chief <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>; <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>, head of the dreaded security apparatus, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinderman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> accused the old guard of `` hesitant, even repelling attitudes'' and said: `` Wrong judgments were made about the situation, and there was no reaction to questions long posed by daily life.'' Independent, non-Communist groups would be allowed a greater role in society, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said, because `` the Politburo thinks that citizens' movements that are within the constitution should be legalized.'' It was unclear how much power any such group would have because the constitution guarantees the leading role of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has said that is not open to debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has accepted New Forum's application to be legalized and the ministry will decide in three months. New Forum was outlawed in September, but has been tolerated of late. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has been under growing pressure at home and abroad to allow free, multiparty elections like those held in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and planned for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Politburo member <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, the party's new propaganda chief and one of those re-elected, said such elections were possible. `` When we have an election law that gives all political forces the opportunity to draw up and represent their own programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will stand,'' he said. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> party chief and a leading reform advocate, gave no timetable or details, and said the party would not embark on such a course `` with the suicidal notion that it could be swept from the political stage.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> offered badly needed financial support to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> if the Communists surrender their monopoly on power. `` We are not prepared to support a system that has lost its legitimacy,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` But we are prepared to offer far-reaching help if genuine and thorough-going political and economic reforms take root.'' The Central Committee decisions and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s speech were reported by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which approves leadership and major policy changes, has 163 members, but only 157 attended Wednesday's session. On the West German border Wednesday, police said 50,000 East Germans had arrived since Saturday, when the Communist government allowed them to go West via <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. It was the first time <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened a direct channel to the West since the Communists built the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall in 1961. Nearly 200,000 mostly young East Germans have left their country this year, either by emigrating legally, or by fleeing through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> grants East Germans automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives. In a dramatic appearance on national TV, author <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> read an appeal from five unofficial, pro-reform groups, including New Forum, to East Germans to stay in their homeland. `` Help us to build a real democratic society,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` We need you ... have confidence in yourself and in us, stay here.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules in Favor of Prosecution in Case Aginst Miami Officer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge made key rulings Wednesday in favor of the prosecution in the manslaughter case against the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer whose shooting of a black motorcyclist touched off January riots. The Jan. 16 shooting by Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 30, of motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, and the death of passenger <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who also was black, in the subsequent crash touched off three days of racial violence. Defense efforts in pre-trial motions to introduce the drug connections and police record of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> were denied by <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> during a break in jury selection. `` You do n't get summarily executed because you are a drug dealer,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiffrin </PERSON> told the judge. <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> also said the prosecution could use testimony about <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> city police regulations to indicate whether <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> acted negligently and unprofessionally. The defense's only consolation came when <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> ruled it may bring up 5.5 grams of marijuana found on <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s body, as well as $ 1,500 cash he had in his pocket. The defense may also tell jurors that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had alcohol and a high level of THC, marijuana's active ingredient, in his bloodstream. The judge, however, barred any such testimony for <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. He reserved judgment on testimony about minute amounts of cocaine found in <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION>'s nose. Wednesday's hearing touched on the key issues for both sides in the case against the Colombian-born officer, who faces two manslaughter counts. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> fired one shot, hitting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head and killing him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer. In the subsequent rioting, one person was killed, 11 wounded by gunfire, and 13 buildings were burned down in predominantly black neighborhoods. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> sought to bolster his client's self-defense argument by saying <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was willing to run over the officer to avoid arrest Calling <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> `` a man who was in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> collecting his drug profits for the day,'' the attorney said: `` He did n't want to stop. ... He wanted to escape.'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> `` was going right through <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> to get away.'' The defense also sought to introduce statements contending the prosecution was racially and politically motivated, and that some prosecutors had privately acknowledged that. But the judgedenied that. Questioning of prospective jurors, which began Monday, continued. By mid-afternoon, the jury pool had been narrowed down to 42 people comprised of seven blacks, five Hispanics and 30 non-Hispanic whites.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Palestinian State Inevitable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is inevitable and further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rejection of this conclusion could be dangerous, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. The study, written by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former chief analyst on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, also concluded that the Israeli and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> search for Palestinian spokesmen who are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` is to all intents and purposes dead.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> is a research center financed mostly by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>'s report was a project he initiated before joining the organization and was not requested by the administration, said Rand spokesman <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> both rejected the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> when it was made last year. But while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would accept a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> if it was the result of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> flatly opposes such a state on the land it captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. The administration has been trying to get <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the 1.7 million Palestinians under <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation to negotiate a political settlement. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will be excluded from such talks, which would initially be convened to arrange elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to negotiate a course between Israeli rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and pressure from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> itself to be included in all talks. The administration reversed a 13-year ban last December and launched low-level talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` To talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is to move a long way toward recognizing the legitimacy of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> aspirations for a state,'' said the Rand report. `` Hardline Israeli politicians know this _ which is why direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are absolutely anathema. Indeed, with the establishment of direct talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now has, whether it wants them or not, indirect negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Entitled `` The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>: Point of No Return?,'' the report suggests that the forces unleashed by the 23-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule `` have now made the ultimate emergence of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> inevitable. `` Such a process will be long, painful and complex. But no other solution any longer seems viable.'' It warns that `` continued efforts by either side to resist what now seems the inevitable compromise of conflicting national aspirations will prove frustrating _ and perhaps even costly.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> advises <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept this reality and assume leadership in bringing about creation of such a state: `` It is important that the birth of the new state not be perceived as an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> victory born of force and violence, for this might encourage further attempts to use force against the Israeli state.''

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thoroughout with Bush pledge to lift trade embargo if
Mrs. Chamorro wins Nicaraguan election in February. No pickup</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Wednesday to lift the trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the U.S.-backed presidential candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, defeats leftist President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in the February election. The statement came after a meeting in which Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for aid to help with economic reconstruction after the election and the two agreed on the need to muster international support for fair elections, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan participants. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent millions of dollars under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to fuel the Contra rebels in their war to oust <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, while endorsing a diplomatic rather than military approach, has continued the policy that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> should be removed from office. He supports Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>'s candidacy, signing a $ 9 million election aid package that will in large part boost her race. A statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> had stressed in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that her administration `` would be committed to reconcilation ... and reconstruction of the economy in peace and democracy.'' `` Should this occur, the president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be ready to lift the trade embargo and assist in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s reconstruction,'' the statement said The trade embargo was imposed in May 1985, banning imports from or exports to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The president looks forward to the day when, with a democratic government, Nicaraguans will have good political and economic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the rest of the free world and will be able to begin rebuilding after decades of dictatorship,'' the statement said. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as part of an international trip seeking to focus the global spotlight on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 election. `` I am looking to my democratic friends to tell them my desire for solidarity for the future'' of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, candidate of the opposition coalition opposing the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said after the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. She also will go to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to solicit international pressure for fair, open elections, said her associate, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>. `` We need more than ever the eyes of the world to be fixed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Do n't look anywhere else, even for a single minute,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said earlier at a luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> human rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Puebla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` All over the world, the time for dictatorship is running out,'' she said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> can not win a fair election, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said. `` In a clean election in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he is not going to win because the people want a change from totalitarianism to democracy,'' she told reporters at the White House. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> stands to benefit from much of the $ 9 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is sending to help with election-related preparations such as voter registration and poll monitoring. The president and Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> agreed that `` although the Nicaraguan government has taken several measures to permit greater freedoms, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have not fully complied with their agreement of Aug. 4 with the opposition coalition. More needs to be done, such as providing equal access to television and full amnesty for political prisoners,'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>'s statement said. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> visited the White House as the Sandinista government said it would propose a new cease-fire to be coupled with demobilization of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would bring the plan to reinstate the cease-fire he called off last week to a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nations-sponsored </LOCATION> meeting with the Contras on Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50 percent of the Contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people they hold. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> should have given the amnesty long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace accord he signed with four other presidents of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Contras should demobilize, she said, adding that the Sandinista government should fulfill its promises. The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> talks wouuld lead to a permanent ceasefire and conditions under which the Contras could return to their homeland `` in safety and with full political and civil rights.'' Contra leaders met Wednesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials to discuss their approach to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks. The Contras were willing to discuss demobilizing their troops, said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Their conditions include full amnesty for those imprisoned in the war and several `` confidence-building'' measures aimed at ensuring secure conditions for those Contras who want to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is sending a 625-member border patrol force to stop Contras from infiltrating the border from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and to interdict shipments of Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says are being made to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>South Korea Orders Halt to Using Industrial Fats in Noodles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Wednesday some food companies are using cheap industrial tallow from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make instant noodles instead of soap, and ordered emergency action to stop them. Instant noodles are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s most popular fast food. Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> directed health officials to stop the use of inedible fats in food and ordered new rules for food production. Health Ministry officials said tests indicated the contaminated noodles were not harmful to health, but consumer groups are demanding tougher food standards. Prosecutors announced Wednesday that 10 senior officials of five food companies would be indicted on charges of using industrial fats and tallow to make instant noodles and other foods. The maximum sentence on conviction is five years in prison. Public anger has grown over what South Korean media call `` the great noodle scandal.'' Officials allege that several leading food companies have used industrial fats, which are cheaper and of poorer quality than those intended for use in food. Government prosecutors say imported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fats and tallow intended for making soap and other industrial uses have been used for noodles and other food products. The companies claim the tallow was purified to make it edible. Consumers have boycotted leading brands of instant noodles, forcing stores to pull the goods from their shelves. Supermarkets have removed other suspected products, including margarine, cooking oil and shortening. News reports say many customers are returning unused food items for refunds. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it had ordered military kitchens to stop using instant noodles, a staple food for the nation's 650,000 soldiers. According to prosecutors, <ORGANIZATION> Samyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has imported more than 8,000 tons of industrial tallow this year to make 700 million packets of instant noodles. It came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's leading exporter of industrial tallow, but officials said there was no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in the scandal. Prosecutors say food companies changed labels on the tallow to indicate it was edible. About 18,000 of the 70,000 metric tons of industrial fats imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year was improperly used in food processing, the prosecutors allege.

 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has halted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> famine-relief operation in its southern provinces because of renewed fighting with rebels in the region, officials said Wednesday. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said any prolonged suspension of aid to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, where about 250,000 people died of starvation in 1987, `` would result in severe food shortages and the interruption of critical immunization and health programs.'' Officials of Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, intended to prevent more starvation in the region, confirmed that Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>'s government had suspended relief flights, rail shipments and distribution by barges. In April, the government and rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a truce so relief supplies to be delivered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operation <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON>, who ousted the elected government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> on June 30, had promised to end the war. The truce generally held until last month, when the government said rebels seized the town of <LOCATION> Kurmuk </LOCATION>. Planes bombed two rebel-held towns in the south after the <LOCATION> Kurmuk </LOCATION> battle and the rebels blamed the government, which did not respond to the charge. Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> saved over 200,000 Sudanese civilians this year by moving 107,000 tons of food in the south before the rainy season isolated villages. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he is `` greatly concerned'' about the suspension because the operation can only be successful `` if its air, road and river transport is assured of an unfettered access to strategic distribution points.'' Both sides were accused in 1987 of using food as a weapon and causing even more people to starve. Rebels led by former army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> have fought Moslem-dominated central governments since 1983 for greater autonomy and economic reforms in the south, populated by blacks who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> or animist.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> gallery Wednesday rejected a request from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> that it relinquish a $ 10,000 federal grant for an AIDS art exhibition as a possible violation of a new anti-obscenity statute. Endowment Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, informed of the gallery's refusal, said that although the grant was approved last May, the funds were never actually sent to the gallery and would be withheld pending a legal opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said a review of the catalog for the AIDS exhibition made clear that `` the nature of the show had changed from an artistic focus to a political focus.'' The $ 30,000 show is sponsored by Artists Space, a private, non-profit arts institution in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where it is scheduled to open Nov. 16. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said the gallery refused to accept his contention that `` the show was primarily a political statement and that it would not be appropriate to take endowment money for its support.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, executive director of Artists Space, said <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> was informed Wednesday of the unanimous decision by the gallery's 23 board members to refuse the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s request to relinquish the grant. She denied that the focus of the exhibition had changed from art to politics. <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> also had asked the gallery, in a letter dated Nov. 3, to publish a disclaimer stating that `` the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> for the Arts has not supported this exhibition or its catalog.'' The controversy over the AIDS show, titled `` Witness: Against Our Vanishing,'' illustrated the dilemma that <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> faces in trying to support the arts community while enforcing a congressional ban on federal support for works that `` may be considered obscene.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the AIDS show, which portrays the effects of the disease on the artistic community, contains some images of male and female nudity and `` deals with sexuality in the context of AIDS,'' although that is not the primary emphasis. The law which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed last month at the urging of Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, specifically prohibits federal support for `` depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts,'' and materials that lack serious artistic value. The legislation was prompted by <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' criticism of $ 45,000 in endowment grants that supported exhibitions of controversial photographs by the <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, whose show included homoerotic images. In his Nov. 3 letter to Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said that `` given our recent review, and the current political climate, I believe that the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is in violation of the spirit of the congressional directive.'' He said that `` certain texts, photographs and other representations in the exhibition may offend the language'' of the new law. `` Because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under and the seriousness of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' directive, we must all work together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not violate either the spirit or the letter of the law,'' he wrote. `` The message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> means business.'' In his interview, <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> said he particularly objected to portions of the AIDS show's catalog which he said contained `` very hostile, angry and accusatory'' statements and `` very politically pointed commentary'' about <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other critics of controversial art and the AIDS cause. Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the gallery board, in refusing to relinquish the endowment grant, was `` taking a stand against censorship and self-censorship.'' `` We believe this is a show that should be funded by the endowment,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It is a very regrettable thing that the endowment has been forced to take this stand by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this political climate we are seeing today.'' She rejected as `` totally erroneous'' <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>'s contention that the exhibition is primarily political. `` This is not a show about politics,'' she said. `` It's a show about AIDS.''

<TEXT>
 The government put army ambulances on the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Wednesday night after regular ambulance crews, embroiled in a pay dispute, said they would handle emergency calls only. An eight-week work-to-rule dispute escalated Tuesday when 2,500 regular ambulance crewmen and women in charge of 455 ambulances at 71 ambulance depots were suspended without pay because of their refusal to handle all calls. Calls for ambulances were rerouted to police and volunteer ambulance crews, with 51 army ambulances mobilized Wednesday night to assist. The last time army ambulances were used was during the wave of public service pay strikes in the winter of 1978-79. Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio that he regretted calling on the army but that the unions `` are still insisting on 11.4 percent.. and they are prepared to take industrial action in support of that.'' The government has offered a pay increase of 6.5 percent. Ambulance staff now earn just over $ 16,900 a year after five years on the job. The crews have asked the government to agree to arbitration. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, senior <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> officer for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded with <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> not to deploy army ambulances. `` I have confirmed that ambulance staff will respond and not place any restrictions on the use of the radio in respect of all 999 calls, all calls for urgent assistance and queries,'' <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON> said. The 999 code is the telephone number for ambulance and other emergency services in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> has said army ambulances will be withdrawn only when union leaders agreed to resumption of normal ambulance services.

 Helicopter crews on Wednesday rescued the last of 51 people aboard a gas-drilling platform 10 minutes before it toppled and capsized in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the coast guard said.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Bill Authorizing Japanese-American Reparations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday completed congressional action on legislation appropriating $ 17.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments and guaranteeing reparations payments to Japanese-Americans interned in World War II. The legislation, which was approved on a voice vote, was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature is expected. The bill fulfills a commitment to Japanese-Americans made in 1988 legislation that authorized reparations payments for their internment but provided no money. It provides $ 20,000 for each of the estimated 60,000 living Japanese-Americans interned in the camps after the Japanese attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The payments, expected to total about $ 1.2 billion, would begin next Oct. 1 and be spread out over three fiscal years at a rate of about $ 500 million a year. Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., a principal sponsor of the reparations legislation, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote tells the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that `` we will keep this most important promise. `` It is a great milestone and heartening victory for those who have struggled for more than 47 years to redress the injustices which 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were forced to endure by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during the Second World War,'' said <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, who as a child was confined to one of the camps with his parents. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> left one knot untied in its handling of the overall House-Senate conference report which resolved differences between the two bills. It left in doubt the scale of appropriations for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> during the 1990 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. By law, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can not receive new appropriations until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes an authorization bill. That legislation is bogged down in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference and it is not clear when it will emerge. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week refused to waive the section of the law requiring an authorization bill to be passed. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending would be frozen at the lower levels that prevailed during the last fiscal year until the authorization bill clears all hurdles, including the possibility of a veto by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who objects to some of its provisions. The bill also contains the lion's share _ $ 7.6 billion _ of the funds to be made available to wage the war on drugs. An additional $ 1.9 billion, representing a drug-war compromise between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is contained in a transportation appropriations bill. The final version of the bill formally repeals a law imposing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The sanctions, imposed at the height of human rights abuses during a period of military rule, were withdrawn by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1983 after <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s return to democratic rule But until now they were never officially expunged. Also included in the measure is a provision creating a formula to guarantee that small states receive some share of the anti-drug funds contained in the bill. Among many other provisions is one establishing an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> databank containing so-called DNA profiles of convicted felons. DNA is genetic material that law enforcement agencies are just beginning to use like fingerprints for identification of individuals. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said the new crime-fighting tool would be similar to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s national fingerprint file and the contents will be shared with state and local law enforcement agencies The measure also provides $ 500,000 to enable the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to expand its training of DNA typing technicians.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> put forth a plan Wednesday for demobilizing <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels and offered to suspend arms imports in exchange. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said last May it stopped shipping arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the end of 1988, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary, said last week other Soviet bloc nations and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> continued sending weapons. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a news conference his decision last week to end a cease-fire after 19 months had opened the way to peace between the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and U.S.-supported rebels. He said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would forgo arms imports until April 25, 1990, if the 15-point plan was accepted. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday promised to lift the trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the U.S.-backed presidential candidate, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, defeats <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in elections set for Feb. 25. His statement came after a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting in which Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for aid to help with economic reconstruction after the election and the two agreed on the need to muster international support for fair elections, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan participants. In their proposal Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> urge that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> divert to demobilization what remains of $ 49 million in non-lethal aid to the Contras authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in March. The aid includes such items as boots, tents and uniforms. The 12,000 rebels, some in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and most camped in neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, are to be disbanded by early December under the regional peace agreement signed Aug. 7 by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. `` If the Contras do n't accept this plan, they will be voting for war,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in apparent reference to the cease-fire cancellation and fighting reported since. He said he would demand a meeting of the Central American presidents to discuss the situation if the Contras rejected his proposals. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he had instructed his government's five-member delegation not to leave the two-day meeting with the Contras at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> without a signed agreement. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, will be present at the meeting, which begins Thursday. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said it would send an observer delegation that might participate more actively after the meeting began. Military commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> leads the Contra delegation. The Sandinista plan repeats some points of the Aug. 7 agreement and sets forth the role of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION>, a joint agency of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> formed to supervise and verify demobilization. It offers to withdraw Sandinista military forces from routes the Contras use to travel between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> so rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> can return to their Honduran camps, and to reinstate the cease-fire Nov. 30. As incentives, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> offer to release all political prisoners under a general amnesty after at least half the Contras have been demobilized and any Nicaraguans kidnapped by the rebels have been freed. An annex to the document deals with the government's offers to guarantee respect for the rights of Contras who return to civilian life in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra leaders have demanded unconditional amnesty. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declared that, before he decided to suspend the cease-fire, `` there were no hopes for peace. ... Now the situation has changed favorably.'' The Sandinistas and Contras agreed to a 90-day truce in March 1988, during their last direct negotiations. After the talks broke down in June of that year, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government renewed the cease-fire on a monthly basis and the Contras tacitly accepted it. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in declaring an end to the cease-fire that thousands of Contras had infiltrated <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and were making attacks. The rebels denied it. Military mobilization began with his announcement and fighting was reported in parts of the country, but the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has given few details.

 A three-mile-long oil slick snaked down the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> shore of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Wednesday, while 86 tow boats pushing more than a thousand barges were backed up 300 miles south at a lock in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, officials said.

Residents of the town, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Bettendorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, feared more ducks would be endangered as they flocked to the village to feed. The spill involved only 100 to 200 gallons of lubricating oil, said <PERSON> Ensign </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` You do n't have to have very much oil to have a sheen on the water,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> explained, adding the spill had not threatened any water supplies. A contractor was hired to contain the spill with booms and remove it, she said. `` Right now the weather itself is containing the spill,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said Wednesday afternoon, referring to a lack of strong wind. The source of the spill was believed to be a boat or a barge, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Vons </PERSON>, an aide to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was investigating the source. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said it was `` probably one of the smallest spills that we've experienced in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> or in the Midwest'' and said crews were cleaning it up less than four hours after it was spotted. As the spill slithered downstream, about 1,200 barges were converged on Lock and Dam 26 at <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, waiting in a 36-mile line to get through. The jam-up was not related to the oil slick. The two-week delay was blamed partly on a temporary gate on the main lock chamber that broke from wear and tear and had to be repaired, said <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanna </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> worker at <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>. `` We always get this backlog each year,'' she said, adding that the gate shutdown increased the congestion only slightly. `` Every year come September and October because the river freezes up above, they try to get it -LRB- the barges -RRB- out of there,'' <PERSON> Sanna </PERSON> said.

 Democrats savored off-year election success in `` everything, all over the country'' Wednesday, while blacks and abortion rights groups celebrated <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s likely victory as governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' triumph as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s new mayor. `` It's a very tough day for Republicans,'' conceded Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> whip in the House. Said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Wait till next year.'' Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> declared his intention to seek a recount in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s close race, saying there must be public confidence in the election outcome `` for the good of the new governor.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, if victorious, would have his full support. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> _ leader by about 5,500 votes in complete, unofficial returns from Tuesday's balloting _ was n't waiting to stake his claim to history as the nation's first elected black governor. `` It starts coming home to you, something happened last night,'' he said. Asked whether the color of his skin had mattered, he told a news conference, `` I'm saying it is not and was not a factor in the results because I was elected.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s trailblazing campaign was `` a little sweeter'' coming as it did in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, and predicted it would pave the way for other black politicians to win seats elsewhere in the old Confederacy. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> went to City Hall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where he will soon take office as the first black mayor of the nation's largest city. `` I got a pretty fair percentage of the white vote, and I think that's very important,'' said the man who pledged to bring racial harmony to his city He said voters had spoken `` with the voice of hope, here and in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> celebrated his personal victory as governor after two previous campaign defeats. Democrats savored regaining the state's top job after eight years as well as two-house control in the state legislature, assuring them the upper hand when the state's congressional districts are reapportioned after the 1990 census. The Republican post-mortem was in progress, even before the final precinct tallies were known. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said his party must be `` willing to rethink exactly what we're going to do in 1990 if we're going to have a successful year'' when 34 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, 36 governorships and all 435 House seats are on the ballot. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a liberal Republican with a strong pro-choice voting record, said, `` If we go in 1990 and abortion is the issue ... we will lose on that issue.'' Abortion rights groups read the returns the same way. `` This morning's election results are a wake up call for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' an opponent of abortion, said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` To politicians everywhere, we say with conviction: If you're out of touch with the pro-choice majority, you're out of office.'' There were pre-1990 stirrings in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial hopeful <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> joined about 20 state legislators of both parties in signing a petition for a state constitutional amendment to make abortion and birth control a woman's prerogative. Among the group was a Republican state legislator, Rep. <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who predicted `` you will see a change in the position our national leaders will take in this issue.'' Tuesday's elections were the first widespread voting since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last summer permitting states to impose restrictions on women seeking abortions. The topic became an issue in all three of the closely watched races, and Democrats put their anti-abortion rivals on the defensive in each of them. `` There's no way for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to find any silver lining at all in what happened yesterday,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` No time in my lifetime do I ever remember waking up the morning after an election where one party had won everything, all over the country.'' `` The Democrats are on a roll,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have recruited better candidates. Our candidates have better mainstream messages. And the voters are responding.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> called a news conference to announce that if the official tally in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shows the candidates separated by less than one half of one percent _ a certainty based on unofficial figures _ `` it is my intention to ask for a recount.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said at his own news conference he was confident of the outcome. `` The mandate is that in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> we are prepared to move and we do n't care what that person looks like,'' he said. Returns from 99 percent of the precincts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> 50 percent of the vote, to 48 percent for Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> had 61 percent of the vote to 37 percent to Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> with 98 percent of the precincts tallied. In a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> contest, a runoff shaped up between two Democrats, state Sen. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, to fill the unexpired term of the late Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a Democrat. While the national attention was riveted to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, much of Tuesday's action was in the nation's cities. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, 71, won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, defeating 40-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> for the second time. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> won her fifth term and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> his third.

 Four hundred police surged onto the campus of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s medical school on Wednesday, seizing bombs and leftist propaganda and detaining hundreds of people as soldiers sealed off the area, police said. University rector <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said around 500 people were arrested. The government would not confirm the number. It was the largest police incursion onto a university campus in the capital since April, when 518 people were arrested in a similar crackdown. Students, teachers and university workers were detained Wednesday, along with people not related to the university, officers said. Classes have been suspended until after nationwide municipal elections Sunday. Police said they confiscated sticks of dynamite, firebombs, propaganda and maps of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> districts marked with the location of voting districts. The main <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> campus was invaded Monday by police looking for rebels who attacked the nearby <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Eighty people were arrested then and police seized revolvers and grenades. The government says the campus serves as a ground for recruiting and organizing by leftist rebels, and a storehouse for arms used in attacks in the capital. Maoist Shining Path rebels have waged a violent campaign to sabotage Sunday's elections, assassinating 120 mayors, candidates and local officials the past 10 months. More than 330 people died in political violence last month, one of the bloodiest months in the Shining Path's 9-year-old insurgency. Police said Wednesday that 27 rebels were captured in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION> department, 185 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The 438-year-old <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> is the oldest university in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. More than 40,000 students use its two campuses, including about 6,000 in the medical school.

<HEAD>State Police Taping Policy Examined In Court</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> WATERBURY </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> _ A defense lawyer trying to expose details of a state police policy of secretly taping telephone conversations between suspects and their attorneys grilled a trooper at a manslaughter trial Wednesday. In another development, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, a Republican who plans to run for governor, called on Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> to abandon a state investigation of the matter, and cooperate fully with a parallel probe by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> questioned Trooper <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON>, who inadvertently revealed the policy's existence last month, and said he would subpoena higher-ranking officials until the policy is explained. `` We're going right up the line,'' said the New Haven attorney. `` If we do n't get adequate answers, satisfactory answers, we'll go to the top.'' The policy of taping calls into and out of state police barracks, including calls made by suspects to their lawyers, was described in The Hartford Courant on Tuesday. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> ordered an immediate end to the practice and launched the state investigation. The Courant's story sent shock waves through courthouses across the state. Outraged defense attorneys predicted that scores of criminal cases would be affected and that state officials could face heavy penalties if it's found they violated state or federal wiretapping laws. Rep. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the state probe of `` this sorry situation'' should be dropped because it would lack credibility in the eyes of the public. Asked for a response to <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandberg </PERSON> said, `` The governor has made his position perfectly clear. He is not in the business of responding to other gubernatorial candidates.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> earlier said he was anxious to talk to Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, who as state police commander is responsible for the policy. <PERSON> Forst </PERSON> is on a hunting trip in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, the governor said he had no plans to fire <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, but said, `` All commissioners serve at my pleasure. We're all replaceable, it's just a question of when.'' In <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> testified in the trial of <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> on drunken-driving and manslaughter charges. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> said he originally thought all phone calls from police barracks were taped, but now is not sure what the policy is. `` If you believe these troopers, they do n't know the extent of the system,'' said <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>. During a pretrial hearing Oct. 24, <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> mentioned the practice of taping all phone calls from state police barracks, including calls <PERSON> Little </PERSON> made to his attorney the night he was arrested. In subsequent testimony, <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> backed off from his original description of the policy. He has said calls are randomly selected to be taped, but has also said he's not sure which calls are taped. Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sealander </PERSON>, a state police spokesman, lent credence to <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON>'s initial description when he confirmed in the Courant's story that a policy exists of recording calls from barracks, including calls by suspects <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> on Wednesday asked <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON>, `` If Sergeant <PERSON> Sealander </PERSON> said that every conversation were taped, would you agree with that?'' <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> replied, `` If that's what he said, yes I would.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators expressed disappointment Wednesday with the lack of progress in deregulating Japanese financial markets to allow greater participation by American and other foreign investment firms. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, who headed the American team in top-level trade talks, said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side had discussed `` concerns and disappointments in the lack of progress in some fundamental areas'' during the day-long session. However, <PERSON> Makoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON>, the Japanese vice minister of finance, who appeared with <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> at a joint press conference Wednesday night, said his country had made significant progress in deregulating its financial markets. `` We believe we have been steadily making progress and we intend to do so in the future,'' he told reporters. Both sides agreed to establish a working group to explore technical questions before their next formal meeting in the spring. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, whose citizens save at more than double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate, has long been an enticing potential market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and securities firms. The discussions began six years ago and have focused on such issues as allowing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other foreign banks and brokerage firms to do business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other issues have revolved around the removal of interest rate caps in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other proposals. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> noted some progress: 50 percent of Japanese savings deposits are no longer covered by interest rate limits. He said the Japanese government was still resisting attempts by American firms to offer an expanded range of investment services to Japanese investors even though they have a `` proven track record'' worldwide. As the talks go forward, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators would also be pushing for the removal of barriers that keep individual Japanese from moving their investments overseas. The meeting Wednesday followed discussions Monday and Tuesday on structural barriers to trade, such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s antiquated wholesale and retail distribution system and the close ties that Japanese companies maintain with each other. At the end of those talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they were disappointed that the Japanese negotiators had not been willing to change various business practices that are widely believed to limit imports into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Both the financial market discussions and the wider talks on structural trade barriers are aimed at reducing the huge $ 50 billion trade deficit that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is running with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a deficit that this year will account for almost half of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s total trade imbalance

 Subway workers and bus drivers went on strike Wednesday to press pay demands, stranding hundreds of thousands of commuters. Union spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> said 75,000 workers participated in the walkout, the worst since President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> took office four months ago. The effectiveness of the strike caught the government by surprise and demonstrated wages remain an obstacle to plans to reform <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s economy. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> went on national television and radio Wednesday night to denounce the strike as `` irresponsible,'' calling it `` an act of abuse'' by both unionists and businessmen. `` This government is going to remain firm in its direction. This government is a strong government. It has immense power, which it is going to use,'' he said without elaborating. Labor Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Triaca </PERSON> said if an agreement between drivers and bus owners was not reached Wednesday, he would order compulsory arbitration during which drivers must work. The union said it would continue the strike. On Tuesday, drivers parked their buses at intersections in this densely populated city of 10 million, deflated the tires and walked away. Many had just been paid and were angry at how little they received. A strike by signalmen on commuter train lines was declared illegal by the ministry, and teachers who boycotted classes last month were docked pay. University professors, doctors, court clerks and public employees in many provinces have staged strikes to demand more pay. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s tough labor policies run counter to his <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional backing for organized labor, which was a base for his electoral support Organized labor in this heavily unionized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation of 31 million claims <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is forcing workers to bear the brunt of sacrifices the government says are essential to curtail chronic inflation and the massive deficits of companies run by the state. Bus drivers who were paid about $ 86 for October are demanding $ 32 more and a base pay of $ 139 for November and December. Bus owners are offering a monthly pay of about $ 100 through March. The government brought inflation down to 5.6 percent last month from 197 percent in July by devaluation, massive increases in public service rates and wage and price guidelines. It is offering an increase of $ 16 a month to public employees. Projecting inflation at a steady 2 percent a month beginning in November, government officials have told private businesses that any increase higher than 15 percent through March may not be added to prices. Employees at the state oil and telephone companies, anticipating layoffs and wage cuts, have protested <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s privatization plans that aim to attract foreign investment and reduce the national budget deficit. Collective wage bargaining with metal workers, perhaps the country's strongest and best paid union, has stalled, and unions representing the majority of employees at public ministries walked out of contract talks two weeks ago. Groups representing industrial and farm groups meanwhile have complained of a pending tax increase and the reduction of tariff barriers that would expose their products to foreign competition.

 A container ship and a British-bound passenger ship carrying nearly 400 people collided Wednesday night at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Elbe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and officials said three people were killed and up to 10 injured. The ferry <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> was struck from behind in heavy seas by the container ship Nordic Stream, said officials for Scandinavian Seaways, the Danish owners of the ferry. They said the impact occurred near a shipboard lounge that is usually crowded with passengers. `` Three people have been killed, we do n't know at the moment if they were passengers or crew,'' a Scandinavian Seaways spokeswoman said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The 10:15 p.m. accident occurred near <LOCATION> Cuxhaven </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> at the entrance to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Harbor police in this industrial northern city said the 475-foot-long ferry had been bound for <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Sea Rescue station in <LOCATION> Cuxhaven </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Nordic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> had been steaming into the Elbe channel bound for <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. The Scandinavian Seaways spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ferry was carrying 277 passengers, most of them West Germans and Britons, and a crew of 96. There were no indications any Americans were on board the ship. Officials in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> said preliminary reports indicated the ferry was carrying 278 passengers. The harbor watch in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> said the victims had been recovered from the ferry. A dispatcher at the Cuxhaven station, who asked not to be further identified, earlier said two people were killed and `` between five and 10'' injured. He said a storm warning had been in effect at the time of the accident with high winds and seas. The Cuxhaven station said helicopters and two navy ships had been dispatched to the scene. Officials in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> said a hole was punched in the ferry above the waterline and that it remained seaworthy. The container ship was only slightly damaged, according to preliminary reports from the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> harbor watch. The ferry was expected to make its way back to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION> early Thursday. The ferry sails every two days between <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>. On March 6, 1987, 193 people died when the British passenger ferry <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> capsized outside the Belgian <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>.

Both Reagans' portraits were painted by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikler </PERSON>. The oil paintings were commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private group. <PERSON> Shikler </PERSON> redid <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s portrait after Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed dissatisfaction with the initial effort. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> portrait was completed in August and originally was to be unveiled in September, but it was delayed when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic for a head injury suffered over the summer when he was thrown from a horse. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has already provided a glimpse of the portraits in her newly published memoirs, `` My Turn.''

<HEAD>U.S., Britain Blocked Italian War Crimes Trials, Says Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Official documents traced by an American researcher show <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blocked the trials of hundreds of Italian World War II criminals, according to a television documentary Wednesday night. The collusion, prompted by fears of unsettling <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s postwar anti-Communist government, meant about 800 Italians listed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> escaped trial, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> program said. Most were wanted for atrocities in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> during occupation by the Italian army, which was allied in the conflict with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from 1939 to 1943. and in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> The suspects included <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Badoglio </PERSON>, leader of the Italian administration formed after the fall of fascist dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> in 1943. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> then changed sides in the war. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> pressed for <PERSON> Badoglio </PERSON> to be tried on charges of ordering the use of poison gas and bombing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> hospitals after <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> invaded the east African territory in 1936. One British document showed the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> countered in a 1945 memorandum that <PERSON> Badoglio </PERSON> had `` rendered valuable assistance to the Allies.'' <PERSON> Badoglio </PERSON>, who died in 1956, was never tried. Among the Yugoslav charges were that Italian soldiers set up concentration camps in which hundreds of people died and that Serbian, Moslem and Croatian units under Italian control murdered prisoners of war. The program, titled `` The Fascist Legacy: A Pledge Betrayed,'' was based mainly on documents traced by an American researcher and graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Palumbo </PERSON> said he assembled the material on the Italians from documents in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> files and in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` These documents show that the British and American allies had engaged in a policy of stalling, deceiving and blocking the extradition of hundreds of Italian war criminals who they knew were guilty of enormous atrocities in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>,'' he said on the program. A spokesman at the Italian Embassy said the ambassador, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Biancheri </PERSON>, had protested to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> about the program on grounds it singled out <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Documents quoted on the program indicated British and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accepted the listed Italians were guilty but, in the words of one <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> document, prosecutions would be `` politically embarrassing.'' `` Justice requires the handing over of these people,'' said a document quoted on the program as being signed by an official of the war crimes sections of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> R.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON>. `` Expediency, I fear, militates against it, or at least the handing over of some highly placed ones.'' A 1946 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report from the <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> stated, `` The claims of the Yugoslav government that offenses of the type charged were in fact committee is corroborated by reports of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the predecessor of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.'' Other memorandum quoted include a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that `` the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> considers that the best action for both governments would be to attempt to stall.''

 <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, an authority on Pultizer-Prize winning novelist <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>, has died of lung cancer. She was 80. She died Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Webster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who delved into <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>'s life after moving here to the writer's hometown in 1946, guided the <ORGANIZATION> Willa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> that was formed in 1955. She wrote a biography of <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> and published a collection of early <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> stories written before 1912. <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> published `` O Pioneers!'' in 1913 and `` My Antonia'' in 1918. Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s interest in <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> began in 1932 when she was the new school teacher in the tiny town of <LOCATION> Inavale </LOCATION>, located in the heart of the farming country described in <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>'s novels. Many of her pupils were the children and grandchildren of the people <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> immortalized in her <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> stories. Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s foundation created a `` living museum'' of nearly 50 sites in Red Cloud and the surrounding countryside that are points of historical interest in <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>'s life and stories. Thousands of visitors travel to Red Cloud each year to visit the restored sites and the <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> Memorial Prairie, 610 acres of mixed-grass virgin prairie. `` Never underestimate what one person can do,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, associate general manager of the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> ETV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> and a foundation board member who was working with Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> on a documentary about Red Cloud and <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> decided that she was going to honor <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cather </PERSON> in the early ` 50s so she called in some of her close friends in Red Cloud to her kitchen and they decided to start the memorial,'' <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said. `` What she started is an important part of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and its history and will be more important as time goes by.'' In 1951, Mrs. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> published `` The World of <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>,'' one of the authoritative books about the early life of <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>, and `` Early Stories of <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cather </PERSON>'' in 1957.

 A West German fugitive befriended three West Germans and two <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in a series of encounters last summer, killed them and robbed them of credit cards and traveler's checks, authorities said Wednesday The attorney general's office said in a news release that <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON>, 38, was arrested Tuesday at his home in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> along with his girlfriend, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON> <PERSON> Geb </PERSON> <PERSON> Moge </PERSON>, 35. The office said the girlfriend knew about the slayings and used some of the credit cards herself. He was held on provisional charges of murder and illegal possession of firearms and drugs. She was held on a provisional charge of conspiracy. Both are to appear before a magistrate on Thursday. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> told a news briefing <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> was wanted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for falsifying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas. <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> police said they confiscated a .22 - caliber pistol, boxes of ammunition, photos of <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> with the Danish victims, cameras bearing victims' identification, receipts from victims' credit cards and several ounces of marijuana when they searched his <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> working with the international police organization <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> said they tracked the two by following a trail of forged credit card signatures after victims were reported missing. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in September 1988, going to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this year. The body of one West German, <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferler </PERSON>, missing since July 14, was discovered near <LOCATION> Pochutla </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> state on July 17. The attorney general's office and <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> gave this account: <PERSON> Ferler </PERSON> met <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> and the two traveled to <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION> in a red <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pickup. They smoked marijuana and drank. <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Ferler </PERSON>, robbed the body, dumped it near <LOCATION> Pochutla </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. On Aug. 12, two more bodies were found in the <LOCATION> Pochutla </LOCATION> area where they had been buried secretly. They were identified as <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedemann </PERSON>, 25, a student of dentistry, and <PERSON> Katin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolaus </PERSON>, 27, a schoolteacher, both from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>. The two had been missing since July 24. Medical examinations showed both had been shot. <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> met them in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. Marijuana and liquor also figured here. The bodies of Danish victims <PERSON> Preben </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristiansen </PERSON> were fished out of <LOCATION> Majahual </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state in August, both shot. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said the two traveled with <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON>, drinking liquor and using hallucinogenic drugs. He said the three argued and <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> shot them in their sleep, robbed the bodies and threw them in the lake. <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bohmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmar </PERSON> will undergo psychological evaluation.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON>'s plays have sometimes bewildered theatergoers. His newest, and shortest, `` Mountain Language,'' will horrify some and mystify nobody. It's a denunciation of totalitarianism. In 20 minutes and a few stark scenes, a police state is shown, squashing individuals. `` Mountain Language,'' opened Wednesday at the off-Broadway CSC Theater. It's paired with `` The Birthday Party,'' one of <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON>'s earliest plays from the late 1950s Women in black winter coats stand along a bleak brick wall as theatergoers enter. One of them, played by <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Makkena </PERSON>, says they were told to arrive at 9 a.m. and it's now 5 p.m. Another woman, played by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, is admitted to a prison to visit her son. She tries to tell him she has brought him bread and apples. A guard forbids her to use her mountain language, the only one she knows. For her attempts to use it, he beats her son, during a stage blackout, and she dies of shock. <PERSON> Makkena </PERSON> sees her husband, a sack over his head, held by two guards. Recordings play their thoughts of springtime at a lake. `` It's my right to see my husband,'' she says. A guard throws her to the floor. She has no rights. `` The Birthday Party'' is fortunate in having <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> to play <PERSON> Meg </PERSON>. As a frowsy, dim housewife, who sounds like her <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> in TV's `` All in the Family'' but actually is very different, <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> is hilarious. She makes serving her husband corn flakes a true comic turn. Are they nice? She asks her husband. Yes, they are, responds <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moor </PERSON>, her perfect foil. He also gives his character some spine and dignity in an attempt to stand up to two bullies who obviously have might on their side. Two men arrive and menace <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, the couple's boarder, played gray-faced and timid by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strathairn </PERSON>. The sense of fear the audience feels comes from not knowing why <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> is being threatened or even if it's deserved. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riehle </PERSON> plays <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, the thug of the pair, who indicates that perhaps <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> has defected from the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> knows immediately why they're there. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegert </PERSON> plays <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>'s boss, whose smoothly civilized speech is meant to mask the deeper evil. <PERSON> Riegert </PERSON> diminishes the play's sense of fear and dread by not making his evil believable. <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> makes up for it by making Act 1 remarkably funny. This does n't overbalance the play; it makes a strong contrast between mundane but valuable everyday life and existence in the terrible shadow of force. <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON> wrote `` Mountain Language'' and `` The Birthday Party'' three decades apart. It's obvious they are related. They're directed by <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Perloff </PERSON>, artistic director of <ORGANIZATION> CSC </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Judge Allows Suit Against Parents of Laurie Dann</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The victims of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s shooting rampage can go forward with their lawsuit against her parents, a judge ruled Wednesday, saying the couple may be partly responsible for their daughter's violent behavior. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> stormed an elementary school in north suburban <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> in May 1988 and fired on a second-grade classroom, fatally wounding 8-year-old <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> and five other children. She wounded a seventh person at a nearby house where she barricaded herself before killing herself. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>'s ruling Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>' parents and others charging that Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, were negligent. The suit alleges the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION>, who lived in <LOCATION> Glencoe </LOCATION> at the time but now live in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, knew their daughter was dangerous but failed to get her help. The suit says that although the couple knew their daughter had a history of violence, they failed to take away guns she owned, gave misleading information to her psychologist and helped her get an illegal, experimental drug for her emotional problems. The judge said that if the allegations are true, there is evidence the Wassermans were not just `` merely permitting'' her to pose a risk to society. `` We are dealing with allegations of a continuing course of conduct that fostered ongoing violent, aberrant conduct on the part of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. He noted allegations in the lawsuit that the couple `` knew about the possession of arms and ammunition, in fact they fostered that ... by providing money'' for her to buy them. He also noted allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> were aware of reports that Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had stabbed her ex-husband and complaints that she had made death threats against other people. In refusing to dismiss the case, the judge rejected arguments by defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reifenberg </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> had neither the ability nor the legal authority to control their adult daughter. `` There was nothing that the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> could have done legally to remove those firearms,'' <PERSON> Reifenberg </PERSON> said. He said they would have had to steal them. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> acted to somehow confine <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> or constrain her against her will ... the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> could, under a certain set of circumstances, be liable for false imprisonment,'' <PERSON> Reifenberg </PERSON> said. `` Hospitals, jails and penal institutions have the expertise to control a violent person,'' he said. `` The same can not be said for the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION>.'' The attorney for <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s victims said the defense was `` really missing the point.'' `` It's precisely because the Wassermans are not strangers, not institutions, that they did n't need guards to take control,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofeld </PERSON>. He said that because of the parent-child relationship, the Wassermans were in a position to `` do things that institutions may not be able to accomplish because they deal with people at an arm's length. It was the second time that <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> turned away an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Wassermans </ORGANIZATION> to have the case dismissed. The couple did n't attend Wednesday's hearing. The judge has ordered them to appear in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by mid-December to give depositions in the case.

The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> as saying 12 families applied thus far and a surge of additional applications was expected after Christmas. Ads in West German newspapers suggested <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as an attractive alternative for refugees who have trouble finding jobs or housing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The population growth rate among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites is stagnant, while the black population of 28 million grows steadily.

<TEXT>
 Members of communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s dreaded secret police will be put to work in industry to stem a growing economic crisis caused by an exodus of workers to the West, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said 385 members of the state security forces will be transferred at once to factories and regional transit systems due to the `` urgent demands of the economy.'' They will drive trucks and replace bus drivers who fled. Pro-reform demonstrators repeatedly demanded at recent street protests that security officers stop snooping on workers and rejoin `` productive society.'' The West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the new communist government planned to fire 15,000 secret police and put them to work in factories and fields. Nearly 200,000 East Germans have gone to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. East Germans have long feared and despised the `` stasi,'' and routinely ridicule them.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, struggling with alcoholism and chemical dependency, was hospitalized because she drank a small amount of rubbing alcohol and experienced a `` severe reaction,'' her doctor disclosed Wednesday. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said in a statement that the wife of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she swallowed the liquid `` in a state of exhaustion, with flu symptoms and depression.'' He did not comment on whether or not she was knowingly trying to hurt herself. <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>, the governor's spokeswoman, said she believed the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> family had removed all alcoholic beverages from their home after Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> entered a treatment program for alcoholism last February. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said the family and Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were deciding what steps to take next. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, who said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been taking anti-depressants prescribed by her psychiatrist, was `` completely out of danger.'' Tests indicated no other drugs or alcoholic beverages were involved, he said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, another spokeswman for the governor, was asked if the incident amounted to a suicide attempt. She said, `` All I can tell you is that you can read the statement.'' She also would not say how much rubbing alcohol Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had ingested. `` Kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and struggled with depression for many years. These two problems often are related. Autumn has been a particularly bad season for her,'' said <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>. Rubbing alcohol is most commonly sold as isopropyl alcohol, according to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, Director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. It is more toxic than ethanol alcohol, which is in liquor, and is irritating to the stomach. About 10 ounces of rubbing alcohol, which often contains about 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, could be lethal, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> said. A woman who answered the phone at the Alcohol Abuse 24-Hour Hotline said it was not uncommon for people with drinking problems to drink rubbing alcohol if nothing else was available. `` Usually it's somebody with a severe alcohol problem,'' said the woman, who declined to give her name. `` They'll drink anything, even hairspray.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was brought by ambulance Monday night to <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> and Women's Hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were `` flu-like symptoms.'' She was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent tests Tuesday, one year to the day after her husband lost his presidential bid. She was admitted to the intensive care unit but moved Wednesday to a private room. <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> on Tuesday refused to answer many questions about her condition. The governor spent Monday and Tuesday with his wife, canceled all appointments, but also refused comment. The health of Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who turns 53 on Dec. 26., is of intense interest because of a high visibility she has never avoided Her ready disclosures about her addictions to pills and alcohol were applauded as courageous and refreshing. During her husband's run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underwent neck surgery. Then, a week before the presidential election, she entered a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> hospital suffering fever and chills. Earlier this year, she underwent four weeks of treatment for alcoholism. She has previously admitted to a 26-year addiction to diet pills. The Dukakises were married June 20, 1963, and have always lived in suburban <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. The couple has three grown children and a granddaughter. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 86-year-old mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also was hospitalized Monday. She was in satisfactory condition Wednesday at <LOCATION> Beth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she was admitted Monday after a bout of fainting spells.

 A state lawmaker's wife was killed by an arrow wound in her chest before dawn at their farm home Wednesday, and sheriff's deputies arrested the couple's 19-year-old son. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>, 51, was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:53 a.m., nearly an hour after the couple's 14-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Shana </PERSON>, called law enforcement officers, said <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. State Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>, 56, suffered cuts to the hand and face, said <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> was treated at <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and released. The couple's son, <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>, was arrested at the home outside <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, a town of about 2,000 people about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. He was being held at the Dodge County Jail without bond. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>, a freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> who does not live at home, refused to talk to authorities, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. A court appearance was tentatively set for Thursday, said District Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schram </PERSON>. `` I ca n't speculate as to what the charges might be,'' <PERSON> Schram </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said authorities have been called to the <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> home at least twice within the past year because of disputes involving the son. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said authorities were uncertain how the son got into the home, but believe he may have entered while his parents were sleeping. His 84-year-old grandmother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>, lives on the first floor of the <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> home. She said she was surprised to see <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> sitting in the stairwell around 3 a.m. `` He did n't answer me,'' she said. She said she then heard thumping from the second floor, where the couple lived, but figured her grandson `` was just stomping his feet because he was mad about something.'' <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> called authorities around 4 a.m., <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> was found in the upstairs hallway with an arrow in her chest. Deputies recovered a bow and arrow, but <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said he could not say whether the arrow was shot from the bow or whether the wound was inflicted by hand. The sheriff said forks and spoons were found scattered around the second-floor kitchen. According to relatives, <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> is Mrs. <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>'s son and was adopted by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON> when the couple married 15 years ago. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetsch </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, said the couple had argued about their son. `` It was hard for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> raising an adopted son,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry is reeling from foreign competitors who are trying to gain a choke hold on the materials and equipment needed to make computer chips, an industry executive told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` Are we going to sit by and allow foreign competitors to control our destiny in such a critical industry?'' asked <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>. `` The equipment and materials industry in this country is falling prey to targeted efforts by foreign competitors determined to control the supply lines, the manufacturing and the end products,'' <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON> said. He did not name specific competitors he had in mind. <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON> told a joint hearing of two House Science subcommittees that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a 40 percent share of the worldwide semiconductor market, its hold on the markets for critical equipment and materials is below that. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> is a government-supported consortium of 14 companies, established two years ago to help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer chip industry compete in the world market. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million in each of the last two years, and committees in both houses have recommended paying the same amount for 1990. In his testimony before the subcommittees, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., blamed the hands-off business policies of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for the decline of the nation's high-tech industries `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have entrusted the president with the economic health of our nation,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` Trampling that trust by quietly sabotaging <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major high-technology initiatives is a national disgrace.''

<HEAD>Bush Envoy Getting Surplus VA Equipment for Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Veterans Department has made available surplus medical equipment to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s special envoy to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for use in that country, the department said Wednesday night. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed two years ago to ease the way for private groups with expertise in artificial limbs to help Vietnamese war victims. That agreement was in return for <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s help on resolving the question of what happened to missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and recovering remains of those killed in the war. There are 2,331 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen unaccounted for, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The envoy, retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, made his second trip to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in October and reported to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday. The president noted on Tuesday that <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> had reported a `` stepped up spirit of cooperation in terms of accounting for remains'' on the part of Vietnamese leaders. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was looking forward to progress on the MIA issue `` and other humanitarian concerns.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said some veterans groups had expressed fear that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans hospitals might be deprived of needed equipment in a time of financial stringency, `` but I think that stems from a misunderstanding.'' All equipment being turned over to <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> is surplus and first has been offered to installations throughout the Veterans Department system and to other government agencies, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The original cost of the items involved was about $ 250,000, but the monetary value today would be much less if any at all remains, he said. Though the 1987 agreement was aimed at artificial limbs and similar prosthetic devices, `` I do n't think there's much of that in there,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. From the list of items being made available to <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he remembered defibrillators, used to restore normal heartbeat in certain cardiac emergencies, and X-ray equipment. `` If this can help Gen. <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> make progress on the MIA issue, I ca n't imagine the most hard-bitten <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veteran having a problem with it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said he did not know what arrangements <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> had made for delivery.

 Six people were executed in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> for taking part in riots there that broke out at the same time the military was crushing the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a local official said Thursday. The six were sentenced to death at a public rally on Tuesday and were immediately executed, said the official of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, capital of southwestern <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. Executions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are usually by a bullet to the back of the head. He said three were charged with `` beating, smashing, looting and burning'' during the June 4-6 riots in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> and three with theft and murder. At least 12 others, including two in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, were executed previously for direct involvement in anti-government demonstrations and riots that wracked the nation this spring. The previous 12 were all non-students. It was not clear whether any students were among the six executed in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> this week. The national press now rarely reports on arrests or court cases involving participants in the student-led pro-democracy movement. Reports that student leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperate in the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been put to death can not be confirmed. Police attempts to break up a student sit-in on June 4 led to three days of rioting in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, with estimates of 30 deaths. A whole city block, including a large department store, was engulfed in flames in the most serious outbreak of violence in any city outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 Miss <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, accused of pulling a gun after a traffic accident, said the other woman involved grabbed her by the hair and beat her head against the pavement while screaming obscenities. The woman, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, told police that the 21-year-old pageant winner, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>, pulled a gun and began walking toward her after the early morning accident. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> was charged with brandishing a dangerous or deadly weapon, a misdemeanor, after the incident, police said. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, 23, was charged with reckless driving, battery and destruction of property, all misdemeanors, police said. Brandishing a weapon carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $ 200 fine. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> was freed on a $ 200 personal recognizance bond and <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> set free on a $ 350 personal recognizance bond after their arraignments Tuesday night. No hearing date has been set. Several telephone calls to <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s residence were answered by a machine. She had n't returned the calls by late Wednesday. <PERSON> Jodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bice </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s traveling companion and business manager, said <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> told her that she did n't have a weapon. `` She said there was no gun, and I've never known her to have one,'' <PERSON> Bice </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said the two had confronted each other before but enied that she had anything to do with <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON>'s accident. `` I've known her for about two or three years,'' said <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, who works at a local restaurant. `` I've never gotten along with her. It's like every time I see her she gives me dirty looks.'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> denied a published report that said the two might have been fighting over a mutual boyfriend. In her complaint, <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> said the car she was driving hit a telephone pole after she tried to avoid <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>'s car. <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> told police that <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> had been following her and had run her off the road before she hit the pole. `` I pulled my car out of the intersection,'' <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> wrote in her complaint. `` The defendant then pulled her car in front of mine and then she got out and came over to my car. `` She put her hand inside of my sunroof and grabbed my hair. I pulled free and then locked the doors.'' <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> then kicked out her window while screaming obscenities and tried to pull her out of the car by her hair. `` I unlocked the door and got out,'' <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> wrote. `` She threw me on the ground and beat my head on the pavement by holding my hair. `` A witness pulled her off of me. She continued to laugh as she got into the car and drove off.'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>'s complaint was shorter and contained few details. She wrote that <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> pulled a gun on her while <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> was in her car. During an interview Wednesday, <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Bittinger </PERSON> left a Fairmont bar about the same time on the night of the accident. `` She turned around and took off and I followed her because I was going the same way,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said. `` She was way ahead of me going pretty fast. I did n't run her off the road. I was just driving normal. `` Then she tried to turn left and hit the pole. I pulled along side her car and stopped and she started cussing me and I was n't going to take it.

 A federal judge Wednesday denied a petition to free anti-Castro militant <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, whom the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is trying to deport as `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s No. 1 terrorist.'' But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> ordered that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> not be expelled while his attorneys exhaust their appeals of the extradition order, made by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in June. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, considered by some exiles a hero of the anti-Castro struggle, has been held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since February 1988 when he returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. `` This order concludes another chapter in the sad odyssey of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> wrote in a 12-page ruling. `` Once a hero of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> resistance to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s communist takeover, his efforts became sullied by his extremes and eventually resulted in his imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> was convicted of a 1968 bazooka attack on a Polish ship in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and fled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> while on probation in 1974. He was later jailed for 11 years in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in the bombing of a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> airliner, killing 73 people, but he was never convicted in the attack. According to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> documents released by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the 62-year-old Cuban doctor ran successful bombing raids in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the early 1960s. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports have linked <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> to terrorist bombings throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into the 1970s, and he is regarded by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s No. 1 terrorist.'' But his attorneys say that <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> now repudiates violence, and his family believes he'll be killed if he is deported. Some prominent Cuban Americans have asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has said it wo n't comment on the <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> case while it's in the courts. <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantero </PERSON>, planned continuing the legal battle, saying, `` I think it's an issue we can win. It's up to the family to decide whether they want to go through the aggravation of another few months litigating this.'' But <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON>, left the court in tears. `` He's a pediatrician,'' she said of her father. `` He's a lover of people _ and this is how this country pays him back.''

 <PERSON> Mbali </PERSON> <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON> wrote her first poem when she was 8 years old. Her inspiration? The Brownies. `` We had to draw some kind of springtime picture, and instead of drawing a picture, I wrote a poem about the spring,'' she said. But she just as easily could have drawn the picture because <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON>, who has a degree in theater from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is an art therapist at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. As an artist, her influences vary. Her office reflects multiethnic culture with displays of African musical instruments and ceramic sculptures created by her young patients. `` We are all citizens of the world,'' <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON> said. `` We write about our whole life experiences.'' In one of her works, `` Messing With a Poet Is a Dangerous Thing,'' which she wrote for her former husband, <PERSON> Aschak </PERSON>, she writes: `` When you've just got to bug someone `` and do n't know who `` grab a dancer `` or a painter `` but leave the lover of oral expression be.'' The 33-year-old Umoja grew up in <LOCATION> Elkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> Elmyra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. She changed her name while a student in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As a child, she was surrounded by books. Her parents are <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> graduate and former <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the head psychiatric nurse at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Literature was a major part of my environment,'' <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON> said. `` My mother grew up in the segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and went through a segregated school system, which opened her up to the experience of black literature. She used to give my father lists of books to pick up during his travels around the country, and they would read them to us. `` The language of poetry always touched me. My mom can read it really well, and it was the written word that related to me.'' Writers who early influenced her were <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelou </PERSON>. but it was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>'s `` Sympathy'' that really reached her. `` It made sense to me when I was about 11 years old,'' she says. `` I was reading it for what could have been the 50th time and it suddenly made me cry. I really felt it. That was the first time I knew that poetry could do more than just sound good, that it had an impact that could n't die.'' Her poetic direction eventually came from <PERSON> Ntozake </PERSON> <PERSON> Shange </PERSON>, author of `` For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,'' which won a Tony award in 1977 for the play's star, <PERSON> Trazana </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverley </PERSON>. `` She took the woman's perspective,'' <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON> said. `` She finally started speaking honestly, in the face of monumental criticism, to what our lives are as women.'' <PERSON> Shange </PERSON>'s writing also taught Umoja what it means to be a female artist. `` You're fighting all the way,'' she said, `` whether you're black or white, or <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>, Chicano _ it does n't make any difference.'' <PERSON> Umoja </PERSON>, whose works have appeared in such anthologies as `` Poets on the Move,'' often wonders what it would be like to be a so-called normal person, one who experiences life as it relates to themselves, rather than as it relates to the greater human experience. `` It would be easier not to be as strong as I am,'' she says, `` instead of functioning as a technicolor character in a black-and-white world. That's how it feels to be me.'' As a high school student, <LOCATION> Umoja </LOCATION> works were strident and bitter, reflecting her rage and the politics of the time. One such poem, `` America the Beautiful,'' was written in 1972: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` The stench of blood is in the air `` Everywhere `` The heat of hate is rising fast `` A shot for the moon, a kick in my ass `` Kent State students dead `` Sadistic pigs busting heads `` Helping me, well, that's a bunch of bull `` But this is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, yeah, the Beautiful.'' Her writing has mellowed somewhat since then. Now, she struggles with issues many women understand _ safety, loneliness, making ends meet and concern for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children. `` I ca n't believe how we treat children in this country,'' she said. `` We need to stop being afraid of our children and make a difference with them.'' She writes of women as mothers, as individuals and as they relate to men. One poem, `` Widow Madness,'' was written after a close male friend died, but it became a tribute to all women who have lost a loved one. In the poem, a woman thinks of her husband long after his death: `` She was two years past those cravings `` past the late night phone call, smothering cold of death's hand `` in her face. `` life went on.'' But later, the woman dreams of the night she learned of her husband's death: `` she never saw `` only smelled the blur of wide shoulders interrupt her search. `` never heard a strangled cry ... `` She only remembered the french quarter aroma, `` wafting from his collar ... `` she climbed his back `` clung hotly to a memory.''

<HEAD>Casualty Losses Get Limited Tax Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a year marked by a hurricane in the East and a severe earthquake on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, many Americans are coming face to face with the intricacies of the tax laws covering casualty losses. And countless others who were spared any damage this time might well be pausing to consider the situation they would face if they are less lucky in some future calamity. The federal income tax system contains provisions for relief among taxpayers who suffer losses from casualties or theft. But the benefits are limited, and not as generous as they used to be. `` Most people with casualty losses are surprised and disappointed by the tax rules,'' says the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Before the tax code was repeatedly overhauled in the 1980s, taxpayers could deduct all the personal-property losses they could document from sudden or unpredictable events such as fire, storm, theft or riot, minus any insurance claims paid. The only limit was the exclusion of the first $ 100 in losses from each casualty _ a measure intended to keep minor cases out of the system. Now, however, a taxpayer's total casualty loss for the year, after subtracting the first $ 100 in each individual event, does not qualify for any deduction until it exceeds 10 percent of adjusted gross income for the year. So for a taxpayer making $ 35,000, a $ 4,000 loss would produce only a $ 400 deduction. Another primary sticking point: The deductible loss for property stolen or destroyed can not exceed your orginal cost of acquiring it, plus any improvements made over the years. You can not claim the market value of a property or collectible item that has appreciated in value over the years since you acquired it. Furthermore, if you receive an insurance payment, based on recent or present market value, that exceeds your original cost of the item in question, the difference is subject to taxation as a capital gain. The law treats such cases as if you had sold the item at a profit, through a transaction known legally as an `` involuntary conversion.'' Of course, these strictures apply only to the question of taxes. They do not take into account any government or private assistance programs that may provide relief for your loss. For example, in places that are designated by the government as federal disaster areas, people with casualty losses can file claims for deductions against their taxes for the year preceding the loss. This is aimed at giving them a chance to seek refunds immediately in order to have funds available as soon as possible for rebuilding or replacement of their lost assets. Some misfortunes are ineligible for casualty loss deductions _ for instance, damage caused over time by insects, rust, rot or exposure to the elements. Also ruled out are any losses deemed to be caused by your own willful negligence. Even in a case where you have an eligible deduction to claim, experts on the subject caution, you often need to take steps to demonstrate its legitimacy. Thus, they say, it helps to establish that a theft has probably been committed if you file a police report soon after an item is determined to be missing. Says the <ORGANIZATION> J.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in its annual publication Your Income Tax: `` If your return is audited, you will have to prove that the casualty occurred and the amount of the loss. The time to collect your evidence is as soon after the casualty as possible.''

 Playing fictional police roles on television is one thing, but there's an added responsibility in portraying a real-life detective, says actor A <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> who stars in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was born <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> but shortened his name to A, appears in the movie about the killer who terrorized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> between March and August 1985. He plays <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, a detective for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, another detective. `` I've played other cops on ` Police Story' and on ` The Whiz Kids,''' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` It's just different when it's someone you get to meet and form opinions of. It puts a responsibility on you. It's difficult to uphold when the piece is not a character study. `` I found myself wishing I could expand on a scene so I could show more of the man.'' `` Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker'' will be telecast Sunday. It ends with the arrest of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, who was convicted on Sept. 20 of 13 murders, five attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries. The jury's recommendation he be sent to the gas chamber was affirmed by the trial judge Tuesday. `` It's really the story of the investigation,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who also has a starring role on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Santa <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he developed a great respect and admiration for <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>. `` He's remarkable because he remains warm-hearted in a de-humanizing job where he is constantly in the face of human behavior at its worse,'' he said. `` It's difficult to imagine myself handling such a challenge so gracefully. `` My favorite part of the picture was when I could show <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>'s personal life and his family He was a victim, too, because he was separated from his family. I sense a lot of pain in him over that. It's fascinating the way he bears it.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who has two children, said in particular he identified with <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>'s empathy for children. `` The Night Stalker harmed a lot of children, directly or indirectly,'' he said. `` That aspect stood out in bold relief.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was interviewed in his dressing room for `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>,'' which he joined within a week of its debut in 1984. He plays <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, a private detective. `` <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> is the hero, who's in love with a woman from the other side of the tracks,'' he said. The character was recently married to the soap opera's heroine from a wealthy family, <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Capwell </PERSON>, who is played by <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> took off four weeks from `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>'' to work on the Night Stalker movie. During that period, however, he still managed to appear in 10 episodes. `` An hour show five days a week is an intensive grind,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who appears in almost every show. `` It's a small cast so the core people tend to work a lot. Even being away for a weekend tends to upset the rhythm of the show. Sometimes the fatigue is your ally because you do n't have the excess energy to get nervous.'' He also co-stars with <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the feature film `` She Devil.'' He plays Streep's gigolo lover. While on location in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, his wife, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryans </PERSON>, gave birth to their daughter, <PERSON> Devon </PERSON>. They also have a son, <PERSON> Dakota </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, the son of a school principal, grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as the third generation <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. As a child he was known as `` Little A'' and `` A-Bone.'' The name was later shortened to A. He got into acting while at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>. He made his professional debut in the movie `` Born Wild'' and had roles in other films. He was a regular in such series as `` <ORGANIZATION> Cassie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` The Whiz Kids.'' `` The bulk of my work has been in Hispanic or Native American roles,'' he said. `` But within that I've played characters from professionals to illiterates. It's a privilege to make your living as an artist. `` Now that I'm a father my desire for cinematic grandeur has washed away. The irony is that for years I was afraid to have kids because I was afraid it would be an albatross around my neck. It's amazing that the thing you feared is what liberates you.

 A help-wanted sign is going out for the 1990s, expected to be a decade of great change in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Fewer and fewer people will be entering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> job market in the 1990s, and the dwindling flow will change the face of the factory and office _ and of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society _ in the coming decade. Women and minority-group members will account for over 80 percent of all new entrants in the labor force in the'90s, says the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. In the 1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce. In this decade, only 18.0 million did so. And in the 1990s, according to a bureau study, the number is expected to decline to 15.6 million. Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males. The coming change in the labor force will follow a decade, the 1980s, of significant social transformation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, lifestyle changes likely to continue through the coming 10 years. Because improved medical care has extended lifespans, the Americans who greet the year 2000 will be on average older and, if not wiser, at least better-educated than the ones who saw the current century arrive. Other lifestyle trends: people are marrying later and divorcing more, and women have become an important part of the workplace. Forecasting into the next century, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vita </PERSON>, a senior researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, says technology may solve part of the labor dilemma by eliminating the need for some jobs. But many millions of new workers will still be needed, and employers may have to turn to older people or immigrants, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vita </PERSON> explained in an interview. Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feeling the pinch and have begun seeking out retired people to fill jobs. `` Many of the jobs that younger workers do are entry level, so the question is if someone with more experience would want to switch and gain some new skills,'' she said. A second choice for labor-short companies may be immigration, if foreign workers can be found with needed skills. In fact, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Vita </PERSON> noted, some bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to shift the focus and give foreign workers with desired skills, rather than those with relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, higher priority for immigration. The growth of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is expected to slow in the'90s. Americans of the giant post-World War II Baby Boom generation are now becoming parents, producing a relatively large number of offspring. The `` Boomers'' were followed by a Baby Bust generation in the late 1960s and 1970s. As this group reaches its childbearing years during the 1990s, fewer potential parents will mean fewer offspring, unless the `` Bust'' generation sharply reverses the trend of recent decades, during which people have postponed childbearing and eventually had smaller families than in years past. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> notes that the elderly constitute the fastest-growing group in the national population. As of 1987, there were 29.8 million Americans age 65 or older, 12.2 percent of the population. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says this group will continue growing into the next century, and will include one American in five when the bulk of the Baby Boom generation has senior-citizen status, by about the year 2030. Census projections show the elderly to be the only group to continue growing through the middle of the next century. The boom in elderly will have a critical impact on health care and retirement-income programs, observes the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was front-page news when the managing editor of the Key West Citizen annouced he was retiring after testing positive for AIDS. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucci </PERSON>, who started 12 years ago as a reporter at the local daily newspaper, is one of the more visible AIDS stories to hit this sunny tourist mecca, but Key West, famed for a relaxed, relatively carefree lifestyle, is coping with one of the nation's highest AIDS rates. Despite signs that a spiraling number of AIDS cases has taken a heavy toll on health service providers, longtime residents say bigger, richer cities could probably learn something from this community's attitude toward victims. `` I think this town is a lot further ahead than others,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondesen </PERSON>, a gay entertainer at a popular resort hotel who has lived here nearly 20 years. `` There's a lot of education and support'' and compassion, he said. However, concerns raised in published reports on the prevalence of AIDS and on its potential impact on the tourism industry anger community leaders. `` My only concern is the way it's reported, not that it's here,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Defeo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel-Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a lot of competition out for the tourist dollar,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` We're more concerned about the hurricane situation.'' Yet acquired immune deficiency syndrome has had a much more dramatic effect on the people of Key West this decade than any hurricane. Just 243 cases have been recorded since 1982 by the <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, which covers all of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, population about 77,000. But the rate of 121 cases per 100,000 people puts <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> -LRB- population 27,000 -RRB-, in the company of such cities as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> -LRB- 104 cases per 100,000 -RRB-, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- 70 per 100,000 -RRB- and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -LRB- 47 per 100,000 -RRB-. Key West has most of the cases. `` In a little town like this, that much AIDS is relatively a lot,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, the health unit's statistician. One reason for the high rate is a large gay population, which has a higher incidence of AIDS. Some victims diagnosed elsewhere also move here, raising concern about limited resources being strained. `` I think anyone can understand our concern, that people who've contracted AIDS elsewhere and are looking for a sympathetic community will think of Key West, but there is a point where the community will be stretched to the limit,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> However, the greater concern for the future is new cases arising from drug abuse, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. `` Like everybody else in the country, we have drug problems, and where there are drugs, AIDS follows.'' How prepared Key West is to handle a surge in new cases is uncertain, but one doctor who sees most of the AIDS patients at his private practice with two other physicians says the island is n't ready `` The health-care resources are not in place in this community, as they are not in other cities,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. `` This community is not yet prepared to deal with large numbers of new patients.'' The spiraling costs for AIDS-related medical care already have had a dramatic impact at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, the county's only public hospital. During the last fiscal year, it absorbed $ 1 million in unpaid bills left by AIDS patients, accounting for about one-third of its bad debt. That figure was up sharply from the previous year, hospital administrator <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. One AIDS patient who died recently left a $ 150,000 bill for a 45-day stay, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was diagnosed HIV-positive in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1981 and moved to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> five years ago to run a guest house. The 36-year-old man died in March without medical insurance after spending the last nine months of his life at the hospital, according to a published report. Lack of state and federal dollars is a key problem, said <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, adding that Key West's size puts it at a disadvantage in competing for financing with cities like <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We're having to do more on less,'' he said. Much of the burden for helping AIDS patients with basic needs has fallen on local groups, such as AIDS Help, which help with rent, food and medication. The focus also has been put on education, with monthly safe-sex workshops, brochures and condoms distributed at gay bars, and free condoms provided at guest houses, among other programs. A mobile testing van, believed to be the first in the state, will soon hit the streets to provide safe-sex education and conduct AIDS tests, said <PERSON> Norene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofranac </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bondesen </PERSON>, who has lost 30 friends to AIDS, said the epidemic has made the gay community more sexually responsible and resulted in a solid support network for AIDS victims. `` There is n't a sense of gloom but more a sense of determination'' to educate people about AIDS, he said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarracino </PERSON>, 73, a saloon operator in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> section, said Key West is a survivor and will carry on as usual, despite what is perceived as negative media coverage of AIDS here. `` We always seem to overcome,'' said <PERSON> Tarracino </PERSON>, who was elected mayor on Nov. 7.

 Clink. <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> drops a nickel into the jukebox. Plonk. He taps C-1. Whir. The platter twists onto the turntable. WHAM! It's 1958 and _ great balls of fire! _ <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> is on the loose: `` You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain! Too much loving drives a man insane! You took my will! Oh what a thrill! Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!'' <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON>, an ex-cop with a ruddy, boyish face, stares fondly at his 1961 <ORGANIZATION> Rock-Ola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> 200, which has the sleek chrome lines of a'57 Chevy. For a moment, he's transported back to his junior year of high school; the gang is together at the neighborhood bowling alley. Then he snaps back. And while the Killer wreaks aural havoc from behind the <LOCATION> Rock-Ola </LOCATION>'s blue metal grill, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> discusses the 100th birthday of that most American of inventions, the jukebox. An amateur historian, professional tinkerer and jukebox wizard, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> has determined that the first jukebox swallowed its first coin on Nov. 23, 1889, at the <LOCATION> Palais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saloon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It did n't much resemble its flashy descendants, nor did it have the same name _ it was called a `` nickel-in-the-slot.'' But the operating principle was pretty much the same: When a nickel was dropped into a slot, a wax cylinder began to spin, a needle plopped onto it and music blared into crude headphones. The songs were about two minutes long, and there was only one selection per machine. But it was recorded music, and the sound quality was surprisingly good. <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> collects jukeboxes, and the family room of his suburban home is a combination warehouse, workshop and museum, crammed wall-to-wall with vintage jukes, wax cylinders, 78 - and 45-rpm records, advertising signs and a bronze bust of the father of recorded music, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> The collection includes a turn-of-the-century nickel-in-the-slot that still works when a penny is dropped in -LRB- prices were slashed from a nickel in the 1890s -RRB-. Slipping in a penny, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> hands over the headphones and a listener hears the imperial strains of `` <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, Gem of the Ocean'' screech through the rubber tubes. `` It's beyond our age _ we really ca n't recall these _ but these are really dynamite pieces, these early nickel-in-the-slots,'' <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> says. `` People could n't afford a phonograph, yet for a nickel they could go out to a tavern or an arcade and settle into a nice song they remembered.'' <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> had n't been born yet, so 19th century hitmakers made do with what was available. One early favorite: `` Nearer My God to Thee.'' The word `` jukebox'' apparently entered the language in the 1920s. The Random House Dictionary of the English Language traces it to `` jukehouse,'' a Southern dialect word for brothel, which in turn came from a West African word `` dzugu,'' meaning `` wicked.'' Americans embraced the wicked machines. The modern jukebox was born in 1927, when <ORGANIZATION> Automatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a machine that had amplified sound and played a variety of selections. It still looked old-fashioned _ like an old wooden radio _ but it set the stage for the heyday of the jukebox in the 1930s,'40s and'50s. Those were the years when <PERSON> Wurlitzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Seeburg </PERSON>, Rock-Ola and other companies competed to create the brightest, flashiest, most multicolored and spectacular jukes imaginable. Jukeboxes became an integral part of the American experience _ particularly the experience of teen-agers flush with burgers and the first stirrings of romance. It was a time when <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Como </PERSON> crooned of his `` jukebox baby'': `` All your lunchtime money goes down the slot, you could live on air if the music's hot. ... Jukebox baby, you're the swingingest doll in town.'' Jukeboxes hit an artistic peak in the post-war years, when <PERSON> Wurlitzer </PERSON> came out with its Model 1015, regarded by many aficionados as the most beautiful jukebox of all time. It was wrapped in a rainbow of multicolored plastic tubing, was trimmed with pieces of Art Deco chrome, played 24 songs and sounded sublime. It was an American classic. `` The war was over, there were happy times,'' observes <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, who runs the Juke Box Hall of Fame in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Money was more plentiful, jobs were opening up and people were getting out and listening to the jukeboxes.'' And along came something else: rock' n' roll. It's no coincidence that the most popular jukeboxes at Fairchild's Hall of Fame are those that were in use during the'50s. It was a golden age, when music and machine united in a marriage made in teen heaven.

 Fairchild recalls growing up in <LOCATION> Tishomingo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, during the'50s. `` If you was going with a girl, it seemed like the songs they had back then _ it seemed like every song was written about you and that girl. All them by <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>, Fats Domino doing ` Blueberry Hill'... the Coasters doing ` Searchin' and ` Young Blood. Whoo! They had some good artists back then!'' <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> remembers, too. `` I mean, God, I can remember the'50s. We used to listen to Elvis all the time on the jukebox _ it was super _ and ... the <ORGANIZATION> Penguins </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhatter </PERSON>, the Tokens ... a lot of those R & amp; B songs, we used to blast them. `` Normally, kids were n't supposed to know where the volume control was, but we all knew where it was in the back, and you just took your little screwdriver and you just slowly, slowly cranked it up.'' To demonstrate, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> leans behind his 1961 Rock-Ola and makes an adjustment, then slips a coin in the slot. A drum beat sounds and <PERSON> Chubby </PERSON> <PERSON> Checker </PERSON> blasts out a song from the year the jukebox was built: `` Come on, let's twist again like we did last summer, let's twist again like we did last year, woo, woo, woo, woo. Remember when we were really hummin'. Yeah, let's twist again, twistin' time is here.'' That was one of the last good years for the jukebox industry. The industry estimates that 43,000 new jukeboxes were shipped to customers in 1955 and 42,000 in 1960. By 1965, the numbers had slipped to 29,000; by 1975, 17,000; and by the mid -'80s, 10,000 to Jukeboxes were challenged by home stereos, shunned by fast-food drive-ins and threatened with obsolescence by the compact disc and the decline of the 45-rpm single. There's been a modest revival in the past few years. In part, the industry has adapted, producing jukeboxes that play CDs and music videos. In part, it is because people yearn for the old times and are buying nostalgic recreations of the old jukeboxes. `` I would say it is going to continue to increase because you are incorporating new technologies into it, which is attracting new audiences,'' says <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group. `` The oldies' thing is going to continue.'' Not surprisingly, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> is bullish as well. `` I think there is a market, especially for the CDs. The CDs are high quality and high-tech. That's what the public wants; they want good music. And that's what the jukebox has been doing for 100 years _ it's been getting better quality, better sound and better reliability. So there is a place for the CDs.'' Still, he says, he hopes the record industry continues to produce 45s. As he speaks, <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> drops another nickel into his jukebox. `` This is one of my favorites,'' he says. `` Percy Faith. ` Theme From a Summer Place.''' The music wells up. `` You see, I can remember from when I was a kid. It's a little flashback: me and my ife, you know, a'57 Chevy maybe, riding down a highway, listening to something like this.'' The song, unabashedly romantic, fills the house. <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON>'s wife begins to dance lightly around the living room, looking for all the world like a teen-ager gearing up for the high school dance. He lovingly looks at her and smiles. <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hummel </PERSON> is suddenly 17 years old _ and very, very happy.

 One of the hottest books circulating in the nation's capital these days is n't available in any store and you're unlikely to get your hands on a copy unless you have a friend in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> The book is a bootleg translation of `` The <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> That Can Say No,'' co-authored by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a novelist and right-wing Diet member of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The rhetoric is n't what Americans are used to hearing from their Japanese allies. The book characterizes the U.S.-Japanese relationship as a `` fatal attraction.'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> writes that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is in an economic malaise because it thinks only about the next 10 minutes, not the next 10 years as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> calls the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a `` shifty country'' and says if it does n't start playing more by Japanese rules, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> might stop selling it the microchips essential for targeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles and begin selling them to the Soviets. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> aides say translations, produced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence and defense agencies, have been spreading like wildfire through <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office buildings. `` I think this is the first time that these kinds of attitudes have been publicly expressed,'' Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said in an interview in his office as he clutched a copy. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., described the Japanese as `` very shrewd business people and who are very clever in promoting the interests of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He said he is worried that the book outlines `` a plan that they've had for a long time.'' Like <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., also has a well marked-up copy of the 74-page translation <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said his initial reaction was `` you've got to be kidding.'' He said he is especially troubled by <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>'s description of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as `` mad dogs'' and his declaration that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should spurn further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance. `` Mr. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> sounds a little like some of the Japanese ultra-right politicians, ultra-nationalist politicians prior to the onset of World War II, which is somewhat disturbing,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said between reciting passages from the book during an interview. There are some important passages in the book, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said, especially those by <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> dealing with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s success in bringing products to mass markets. `` This part of his message has gotten lost underneath the burden of all these other statements and this inflammatory rhetoric,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. `` This is a message that is awfully important for Americans to know.'' Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., agrees with <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> that some of <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>'s comments `` were right on the mark'' and <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>'s words `` inaccurately reflected some of the issues between our two countries. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said that was why he began passing out copies of the book to his Capitol Hill colleagues. `` I felt this was important,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. `` It was something that they should have the opportunity to see.'' Despite his role as an unofficial distributor, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said media accounts about congressional reaction to the book should not be `` overblown.'' Such reports filtering back to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> already have helped boost sagging sales of the book there, according to the Kobunsha publishing company. Interest is growing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as well. `` We've had people in here every day going absolutely bananas looking for it,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassum </PERSON>, who works at a bookstore in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We're losing our minds trying to track it down.'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> emphasized that he did not commission the unofficial translation, saying his came from the Pentagon. A congressional aide, speaking on condition he not be identified, said that the version <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> obtained was translated by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and that another translation done by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also has begun circulating in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Yet another version is making its way through <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and other American high technology centers At <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, international affairs director <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> office director <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> said the book expresses views that have been aired in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a long time. `` It is n't so surprising,'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said. `` For <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appear shocked is a measure of how little they follow <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in any kind of depth.'' <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> said he thinks he knows why the book has received bad reviews in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a tendency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, maybe in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in terms of various policies toward <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to assume their total dependence on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This book puts a little chink in that armor. This is the first time somebody -LRB- in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- has said, ` Hey, wait a minute, we can go some other way.''' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, a former official in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Commerce departments, said congressional criticism of the book will only make things worse for American companies trying to penetrate Japanese markets. `` The more bashing that occurs as a result of things like this book, the more those Japanese who think like Mr. <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON> are inclined to cast off more on their own and throw us out,'' she said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has voted to impose strict new controls on auto exhaust pollution. The provision, similar in its initial stages to one approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, passed 7-6 Tuesday over the objections of the auto industry and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, who contended consumers would pay an extra $ 500 a car as a result. An initial set of reductions would begin with 1993 models, making all cars meet standards required in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, currently more stringent than those in force elsewhere. By 2003, an additional 50 percent cut in emissions of major pollutants would be required.

 Fixed-rate mortgage rates dropped to 9.85 percent in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a report expressing optimism for the sluggish housing industry. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that its monthly national survey showed October rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages down from 9.93 percent in September and returning to their August level. The rate had been 9.73 percent in July, the lowest since a 9.25 percent rate in March 1987. `` With the prospect of mortgage rates moving somewhat lower during the next few months after significant declines earlier in the year, signs of strength in the housing market can be expected to continue,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, the association's chief economist. Rates for adjustable mortgages, meanwhile, edged up to 8.55 percent in October from 8.53 percent in September and 8.51 percent in August. As the fixed-rate mortgage rates declined, homebuyers have turned away from adjustable-rate loans recently. In September, the percentage of adjustable rate mortgage applications fell to 13 percent, down from 15 percent in August. ARM applications had been 25 percent of total applications in June.

 A new round of layoffs could be coming to <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as financial firms continue to be pinched by the 2-year-old slump in the brokerage business, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> began laying off employees this week in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its work force by year's end `` It's not a problem just for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>; everybody has it,'' said <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think we'll be seeing several cutbacks but in smaller numbers ... to avoid a lot of media attention.'' Shearson and other Wall Street firms, particularly retail brokerages catering to individual investors, have been under increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of rising operating expenses. Most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year due to the stock market's October plunge and the general pressure on takeover stocks, which had been the driving force behind the market's earlier advances. The lingering wariness of individual investors since the October 1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry. `` I would n't sit here and wait for his -LRB- the individual investor's -RRB- imminent return in size,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbury </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroeder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` With business slow and expenses high something's got to give.'' Total employment by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-member brokerages has fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262,173 employees in September 1987 to 229,455 by mid-1989. The firms had added about 120,000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash. The decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the growth of revenue. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group, said overall revenue grew from $ 50 billion in 1986 to $ 52 billion last year. Although revenue rose to $ 60 billion by mid-1989, it was expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> _ second only to <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in terms of the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail brokerage offices _ began laying off some of its 38,500 employees Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph newsletter that more across-the-board cuts were planned, said company spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> cited, among other things, the slowdown of market activity, which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds that generates commissions and trading profits. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of financial services giant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, earned $ 106 million, or 98 cents a share, during the first three months of this year. That was off 3 percent from earnings of $ 110 million, or $ 1.05 a share, in the same quarter last year. <PERSON> Faigen </PERSON> declined to provide details on <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s layoffs and said only that `` several hundred'' employees would lose their jobs in the next few weeks. But a company source speaking on condition of anonymity said as many as 800 people, or 2 percent of the total work force, could be cut. That would be the largest staff reduction on Wall Street this year. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then it has trimmed 300 more jobs. Other Wall Street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this past year. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> laid off more than 100 employees in its taxable fixed-income sales division. The firm announced earlier this year it was selling its entire retail brokerage division of 2,300 workers. Over the past three years it has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10,000. Among the others, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last spring laid off 200 employees, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has let go dozens of bond traders and <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> laid offabout 120 employees, largely in its municipal bond and stock departments. Long said that in addition to gradual cuts, many firms `` are paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring.''

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Additions Slowed in September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reflecting caution about buying cars and other expensive goods, American consumers drastically slowed their borrowing in September, adding only $ 606 million in credit card and other debt. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent in September, down from a revised 4.6 percent rate of advance in August. For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent. August's net debt increase totaled $ 2.66 billion, a sharp revision from the $ 3.48 billion originally reported last month. The pace of net borrowing in September was the second slowest of the year after an actual decline of 0.9 percent in July. That was the first drop since January 1987 when consumer debt fell 3.4 percent. Consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the economy's health because it represents two-third of all economic activity. The economy, particularly housing and manufacturing, has become sluggish in recent months in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to restrain growth and ease inflationary pressures by keeping interest rates relatively high. Auto loans, which had dropped sharply in July, rebounded a bit in August, driven by end-of-model-year sales incentives and higher prices for 1990 models to come. The August sales had the effect of stealing from those ordinarily expected in September. As a result, auto loans in September dropped $ 842 million, a 3.5 percent annual rate of decline, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said. They were virtually unchanged in August after declining 6.9 percent in July. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report may not accurately reflect the amount of consumer debt since people have other ways to borrow, such as home equity loans, that are not included in the survey. But she said consumers are becoming more cautious in their spending, particularly for autos and other durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years that often are financed by loans. The category of debt that includes credit cards slowed to a 4.7 percent annual rate of growth from a 21.2 percent advance in August. Total revolving credit increased $ 756 million, compared with a gain of $ 3.37 billion in August. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by $ 785 million, a 4.8 percent annual rate of growth. That compared with a decline of $ 29 million, or 0.2 percent, in August. Mobile home debts continued to fall, down $ 91 million or a 4.8 percent annual rate of decline. This category has fallen for eight consecutive months, including an August drop of $ 692 million or 35.1 percent. The various changes left total consumer debt in September at a seasonally adjusted $ 703.6 billion.

<HEAD>Braniff Employees Gather To Reflect on Airline's Fate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dozen <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees gathered Tuesday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Minsky </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lounge near <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, reflecting on the fate of the carrier on which they had spent thousands of hours of their lives. They had come from all over the country to be part of the airline's expansion, under which <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was a major hub. But as <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> watched the television news of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s sudden cancellation of its flights, tears began to well in her eyes for the second time in about a month. `` We're a family,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, a 16-year <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant. `` It just breaks my heart.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, who recently bought a house, said work in the airline industry was now over for her. `` I'm fatigued. I want to try something else,'' she said. For many <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees, the bond among workers was a key reason they stayed with the carrier, even after their jobs were put at risk by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s filing for bankruptcy court protection in September. `` That's why we've gone through what we have,'' said J.T. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who has worked as a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> customer service agent for 17 years. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and some others said they remained optimistic that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> would fly again. `` Once again, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees hold their heads high,'' he said as he raised a glass. But for many of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s workers, the stoppage of flights late Monday seemed to confirm their previously unspoken fears that little hope remained for their carrier or their jobs. Some spoke harshly of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s investors, who have been accused of reaping riches at the expense of the company and its workers. `` This may be the final straw for me,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant who spent Tuesday interviewing for other work. `` It's very stressful to wait around for this sort of announcement.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Goduti </PERSON>, a vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think a lot of pilots were waiting for the other shoe to fall.'' He added that some pilots were now starting to look for work elsewhere. Neither union officials nor <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> workers knew late Tuesday what would become of their jobs. They said they were left in the dark, just as they were a month ago.

 Embattled <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> closed its corporate offices and refused further comment after grounding its last 46 daily flights while it seeks investor cash or an outright buyer. `` I do n't expect any further announcements,'' airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at the airline's <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> headquarters said Tuesday after the abrupt cancellation of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s schedule. Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and other executives were busy arranging details to mothball the carrier's fleet and notify most of its remaining 1,800 employees that they were without jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will determine by Friday the exact size of its remaining work force, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing. `` It could be 150 to 250 or 300 people,'' <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> probably will not honor an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to extend employee health insurance coverage through November. If the airline fails this week to pay premiums to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> or fund the trust that pays employees' medical claims, coverage ends Friday. A severe cash shortage aborted the airline's reorganization plans under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, said <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> in a terse statement at midnight Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for protection from its creditors on Sept. 28, wants to continue its charter services while looking for investors or a buyer. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s regular charter customers include the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> football teams. `` There are no plans at this point to gave consideration to liquidation,'' said <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>. He said discussions are under way `` with potential investors'' whom he declined to identify. The carrier had been operating from week to week by relying on emergency infusions of cash approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. In its bankruptcy filing, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> listed debt of $ 347 million and assets of $ 326 million. Before the filing, the carrier operated 256 round-trip flights a day and employed up to 4,800. `` They pissed away all their cash at the rate of $ 300,000 a day when they should have been preserving their cash for a restart of the airline,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, editor of `` Commercial Aviation Report,'' a newsletter based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` Continental and Eastern could fly through their bankruptcies because they had multi-millions of cash on hand,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> carriers that have undergone bankruptcy reorganizations. Eastern is now flying under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. `` <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had only $ 3 million to $ 10 million in cash on hand,'' he said, noting that the airline needed $ 50 million to $ 100 million to survive. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had as much as $ 31.6 million in February, but was down to only $ 3.6 million by July 31. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> said, a meeting of its unsecured creditors took place Tuesday in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. But the airline would not comment on what was discussed. However, a source close to the case contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, which was retained by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> to explore alternatives for the carrier, made a presentation about the airline's financial condition. No potential buyers were discussed, however. The abrupt schedule stoppage surprised and angered employees and left a few unsuspecting customers frustrated in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and other major airports. Ticket-holders were advised on a toll-free telephone line to check with other airlines `` who may honor tickets in some cases.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> ticket and check-in counters were unstaffed Tuesday, and passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers. Eastern was taking <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> customers on a standby basis, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was giving <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> ticket-holders a 50 percent discount on a full-fare coach ticket, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> also were honoring tickets, with some restrictions. There were no long lines at <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> ticket counters like those that formed in September when the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection, but the few customers who did show up Tuesday were confused and bitter. `` We do n't know what we're going to do,'' said <PERSON> Helaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruglio </PERSON>. She and her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, both 27, were in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> on a seven-day vacation. They were scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Tuesday evening, but went to the airport nine hours early when they heard of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s cancellations. In 1982, a much larger <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection when it was nearly $ 1 billion in debt. Two years later, the airline started flying again as a low-cost, no-frills carrier. The company was acquired by BIA-COR, an investor group formed by <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in June 1988, and shifted most of its flight operations from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Complaints of lost and mishandled baggage received by airlines in September, shown as the number of complaints per 1,000 passengers on the airline. Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of reporting. For example, some airlines count in their complaint data courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other airlines find lost baggage.

<HEAD>Times to Close Plant, Consolidate Operations at New Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said it does not expect to lay off workers when it closes a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> printing plant. Times spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said the bulk of the 1,200 workers employed at the plant in <LOCATION> Carlstadt </LOCATION> would be transferred to the <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> plant where new color presses are to begin operating next summer. `` We do not expect layoffs,'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said, and buyouts are a possibility that would be discussed. The Times said in a statement that the decision to close the <LOCATION> Carlstadt </LOCATION> plant was influenced by a two-year decline in advertising revenue _ `` a trend which is expected to continue in 1990.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the number of jobs that would be lost was `` open for discussion.'' `` We are both united, both the unions and the company _ united for the benefit of getting this up and running without any problems,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said after an afternoon meeting where Times Publisher <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primis </PERSON>, president of the Times, addressed leaders of the 10 unions represented by the council. `` As in the past, the Times will work with its unions to find ways to insure the security of its regular employees,'' <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON> said in a statement. The unions' contracts, which do not expire until March 30, 1993, agree to what the Times statement called `` the orderly, successful and efficient start up and operation of the new plant'' and the use of arbitration to resolve any disputes. Advertising linage declined 5.5 percent in 1988 compared to 1987 and declined 7.9 percent for the first three quarters this year, the Times said. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said that no figures were available to compare the linage decline and the decline in revenue. But revenues were up for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, she said. In the first nine months of this year, revenues were $ 1.29 million, versus $ 1.25 million for the same period last year. The company's newspaper group, consisting of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and 35 regional newspapers, had revenue of $ 1.02 billion for the first nine months of 1989, versus $ 1.01 billion for the same period in 1988. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> said there were no separate figures for the Times. The bulk of the revenue comes from advertising. The Times circulation also climbed, according to <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulations </ORGANIZATION> figures quoted by the newspaper. Circulation reached a record for the six-month period ended Sept. 30 of more than 1 million on weekdays, up 2.8 percent over the same period last year. Sunday circulation was up 1.7 percent during the same period to more than 1.6 million. The automated Edison presses, which will cost more than their original estimate in excess of $ 400 million, are situated on 45 acres of land and will greatly increase production. Automatic Guided Vehicles, or <ORGANIZATION> AGV </ORGANIZATION> robots, are part of the production, which is estimated to be 70 percent complete.

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> defended the integrity of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator cried foul and quit the exchange's board of directors. Former Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> resigned Tuesday, saying concern for `` fat cat'' insiders outweighs the interest of the average investor at the world's second-largest futures exchange. <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> accused the Merc of trying to protect its former chairman, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>, who is before a <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> hearing board this week on charges of failing to stop two employees from defrauding investors. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he admires and respects <LOCATION> Eagleton </LOCATION> but disagrees with the criticism, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> punishes those who break exchange rules. `` I think if you go back and take a look ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- have severely punished the violators that they have found,'' <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home. <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said the board's efforts regarding the former chairman was `` the straw that broke the camel's back,'' and said he had become increasingly disappointed by the board's decisions. `` When a serious decision is made by the board, I have found that consistently it's what's best for the insiders that prevails, not necessarily what's best for the public,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said from his law firm in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Because of its concern for insiders, the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> can not be trusted by the public to police itself, <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said. `` Joe Six-pack sitting in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> can have no confidence that the order he's entering is going to be treated the same as a fat cat's order within the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> said. `` He just ca n't have any confidence in that, and that's a rotten shame.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> issued a three-sentence statement saying <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON>'s resignation was accepted <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the commission had no immediate comment. As evidence that the exchange protects its own, <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> pointed to the willingness of <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> to act as character witnesses in the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> action against <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON> said Tuesday he has decided not to testify on <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON>'s behalf, citing the advice of attorneys who examined the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s code of ethics. Home telephone numbers for <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON>, were not available in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> has an unpublished number. <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> was serving his second two-year term on the 31-member board of directors, one of six board-appointed public or industry members. The remaining 25 directors are elected from among <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> members. `` His service has been appreciated although there have been some differences of opinion in recent months,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Although the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> does not allege that <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> himself engaged in fraud, it contends in an 18-page complaint that from at least January 1986 until May 1986, `` he did not act in good faith and-or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the fraudulent trade allocation by'' the two GNP brokers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, also a former <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> president, has been identified as a potential character witnesses for <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> in the seven-day hearing. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has not yet testified. <PERSON> Monieson </PERSON> is head of <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn was steady to slighty lower after reports that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have entered the market for about 280,000 metric tons of corn. Analysts say corn prices may drift lower in expectation of tomorrow's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report. The report is expected to contain an upward revision in this year's corn production. Prices of soybeans softened on concerns about quiet soymeal trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Debt Comes Due As Exports, Tourism, Foreign Lending Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first big pile of bills from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decade-long economic boom are coming due next year, and the timing could n't be worse Foreign exchange earnings are down: tourism is a major casualty of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and export growth is hobbled by severe shortages of energy, raw materials and cash. Foreign commercial banks, which will be needed to roll over and reschedule some of the debt, are still warily assessing the political and economic fallout from the June power struggle and army crackdown on student protesters. Foreign banks have joined recently in arranging three group loans for Chinese state-owned companies, each involving about $ 50 million. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s government decided in October to grant <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> a $ 7 million interest-free loan to buy a Finnish paper mill. But one Western banker said the message from home offices is still `` go slow with long-term commitments.'' For now, any new loans will cost the Chinese at least half a percentage point more in interest than before June, and bankers want shorter terms and more guarantees. `` There's a crisis of confidence,'' the banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The green light everyone is waiting for is the resumption of new <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans, halted in June because of the confusion in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s major shareholders, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have prolonged the freeze as a political sanction. The <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which also offers low-interest loans, must make a decision before the end of its fiscal year in December on whether to go ahead with loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Its president, <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujioka </PERSON>, said recently that the bank still was preparing loan proposals. Chinese officials, meanwhile, insist their credit-worthiness remains good. Vice Finance Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongli </PERSON> has repeatedly said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will have no difficulty in paying back loans. But he acknowledged for the first time in October that it would be possible only by taking out new loans. He also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might set up special debt-service funds to make sure money is available for repaying debts. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, $ 15.8 billion in 1985, jumped by about $ 10 billion dollars in 1987 and again in 1988 as cities raced to build luxury hotels and offices towers and factories imported modern assembly lines. The total is now about $ 42 billion, with about $ 7 billion in principal and interest due in 1990, the first big repayment year. The government also has a domestic deficit that it is covering by cracking down on tax delinquency and issuing new `` guaranteed value public debt'' notes. The notes are sold in units starting at $ 5.40. Most work places are requiring employees to buy at least one. Workers already are required to buy treasury bonds amounting to half a month's salary each year. The external debt, which must be paid in foreign exchange, presents a greater challenge. Most of it was contracted for projects expected to generate foreign exchange. Eighty percent of the loans went to construction projects, including luxury hotels and office buildings for foreign businessmen. But even before June's violent attack on the student pro-democracy demonstrators scared away tourists and businessmen, real estate experts agreed the sector was overbuilt. Since June, few hotels have been able to achieve 50 percent occupancy. Rentals of newly opening office towers have slowed, and foreign bankers say they are quietly rescheduling loans on many projects. Other foreign loans went to modernize export industries such as textiles, but shortages of cotton, raw silk and energy have hampered growth. Despite the problems, foreign bankers say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s credit rating remains good, and that it is just a matter of time before outrage over June's events fades and their home offices approve a return to business as usual. `` Our experience is quite good. They are strict in their repayment,'' said the Western banker. Assessments are mixed as to whether <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s year-old austerity program, which has drastically tightened domestic credit and slashed new construction, has made the investment climate better or worse. Inflation has dropped sharply: September prices were up just 13 percent from the previous September. But credit has become so short that many companies lack operating funds and in some places business has deteriorated to barter. `` I would n't give a penny to a -LRB- Chinese -RRB- factory as a borrower,'' said another foreign banker. But he said major institutions such as the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> remain good risks.

 The tiny woman whirls around carpet rolls on a motorized cart, approaches a customer and asks: `` Are you finding anything?'' Nearly 96, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> is back selling furniture and carpeting at a new store she hopes will compete with the first one she founded 52 years ago and left last May in a power struggle with her two grandsons. Customers who remember her from <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest individual furniture stores, are finding their way across the street to Mrs. B.'s Warehouse. And it has n't even opened officially. `` I got the devil in me. I'll fight as much as I can,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> said recently as she spun around the store, helping customers and talking about her plans for the future. `` My two grandsons say I'm too old and too cranky. They do n't know nothing,'' she said Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON>, a 4-foot-11 Russian emigrant who began selling furniture in the basement of her husband's secondhand store, built <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> into a business that had more than $ 150 million in sales last year. The store is known throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for its policy to `` sell cheap and always tell the truth'' and ships furniture to customers throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. B sold the business for $ 55 million in 1983 to <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but remained chairman and ran the carpeting department until May 3 of this year, when she walked out in a dispute with two grandsons. She said her grandsons, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON>, thought she paid too much for carpeting and charged too little. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON>, the president, said he views his grandmother's nearby store as competition `` We're not going to treat any competitor differently,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> has a long way to go to threaten <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Furniture Mart, but she is trying. One woman in the store recently walked over with three samples of the carpet she ordered from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Furniture Mart. Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> quoted the woman prices slashed down from the marked prices. `` I'll guarantee you to save $ 350 maybe $ 400,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> said. `` I do n't need no money. I want to get even with them. ... I'm going to give them all the hell I can. A mother of four, grandmother of 12 and great-grandmother of 18, Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> sometimes tells her customers what they want, or should want. `` I always stuck in my nose and saw that they bought right,'' she said. <PERSON> Cherene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> knows that firsthand. Mrs. <PERSON> Lantis </PERSON>, 27, who bought carpeting from Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> a few years ago, was in Mrs. B's Warehouse recently to buy more carpeting. `` I'll come to her first,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lantis </PERSON> said. `` She gives you a good deal. She does n't cheat you. I love her. She's real honest.'' She remembers Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> arguing with her in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Furniture Mart that she did n't need as good a quality of carpeting in her bedrooms as in other areas that had higher traffic. She also remembers Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> giving her 3-year-old daughter a ride through <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Furniture Mart on her cart. Mrs. <PERSON> Blumkin </PERSON> said she cried every day for two months after she quit before deciding to take some of her earnings and start over again. Her day is long. She gets up at 6 a.m.. She is at the store by 9 a.m. and works until 5 p.m.. She then often goes with a driver around town, checking out parking lots and stores of competitors, until as late as 9 p.m. `` To me, it's the biggest punishment when I'm home,'' she One of eight children born to a rabbi and his wife in a small town near <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, she learned to read and write but had little formal education.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today signed a bill raising the government's borrowing limit to $ 3.1 trillion, averting a government financial crisis and allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to replenish its empty coffers. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had approved the legislation raising the national debt ceiling the night before. The bill allows the government to avoid a default on paying its bills for the first time in history. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that with the higher limit in place it would resume borrowing immediately. An auction of $ 16 billion in three-month and six-month bills, originally scheduled for Monday but reset for later today, will permit the government to redeem the $ 13.8 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills that mature on Thursday. Its passage also sets the stge for pressurized confrontations between the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a range of issues _ such as how to stem the tide of red ink that has led to the nation's huge debt burden. `` It provides momentum,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. Lawmakers will focus on wrapping up some long-contentious issues because `` there really is a chance to conclude the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before Thanksgiving,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by voice vote, and then the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, by 269-99, sent the debt bill to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday night. The measure increases the borrowing limit by $ 300 billion to finance government operations well into 1991. Despite such highly touted efforts as the Gramm-Rudman law, government spending continues to outpace revenue, recently at a rate of $ 150 billion a year. As a result, the government has been forced to borrow more and more money. The new statutory debt ceiling, an increase from the $ 2.8 trillion already borrowed, is more than three times what it was at the beginning of the 1980s. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> had said that unless they were allowed to issue new debt, the government would have been unable to pay its debts on Thursday. It would have been the first-ever default by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, a calamity for the world financial markets and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prestige The debt bill was passed following days of complex negotiations between the two parties on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the president's representatives As a result of the talks, divisive issues such as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax cut and a move to repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic illness law were kept off the debt bill rather than risk default. The debt bill did carry one legislative sweetener: repeal of a provision in the 1986 income tax law known as Section 89. The provision prohibited employer-financed health insurance plans from discriminating against lower-paid workers. Business said it was an onerous burden, and its repeal was widely supported in both parties. As part of the deal allowing the debt bill to speed through Tuesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was expected to pass for a second time a measure to repeal the catastrophic illness law. The repeal was attached earlier this year in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to a deficit-reduction bill that is still pending. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> countered with a plan to scale back, but not completely repeal the catastrophic law. The White House and congressional leaders have now agreed to consider catastrophic separately from the deficit bill. That decision was made easier because the repeal would increase the deficit, at least in the short term. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week agreed to drop his push for a capital gains tax cut this year. He changed his focus to pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a strong deficit-reduction bill. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, annual government spending in fiscal 1991 was automatically cut $ 16.1 billion dollars beginning Oct. 1. If a deficit reduction bill is passed and signed by the president, those cuts would be at least partially reversed. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are currently negotiating apackage of cuts in entitlement spending and selected tax increases which would help meet the deficit-reduction goals.

 <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> today announced a $ 1.7 billion buyout offer for <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest utility, from its financially troubled parent <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Pinnacle West also is the holding company for <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION>, a federal savings bank that has suffered increasing losses and is under federal mandate to increase its capital reserves <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> said it was offering to purchase all outstanding common stock in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> utility for $ 1.7 billion. Pinnacle West holds all of <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 71 million common shares, a <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said the cash buyout would enable Pinnacle West `` to strengthen its other businesses.'' Pinnacle West executives and spokesmen did not immediately return telephone calls. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s public information manager in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said: `` Our intent is for a friendly merger.'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> became interested in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> utility after acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We have gained significant experience in what types of mergers would be beneificial for our customers,'' he said. Under <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> customers would be subject to no more than 2 percent annual rate increases over the next four years. He said that customers would face `` significant rate increases'' if Pinnacle West maintained ownership. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> supplies elecricity to some 1.6 million people in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, according to industry figures. It is a part owner of the three-reactor <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> Nuclear Generating Station, located about 50 miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Other part owners include the Salt River Project in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and additional utilities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Pinnacle West's <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> unit has been hurt by general weakness in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> real estate market, which has increased the number of its non-performing loans while reducing revenue from loan origination fees, analysts say. Federal regulators are demanding that Pinnacle West pump an additional $ 180 million into <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> to guarantee against insolvency. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in July temporarily capped the amount of dividends that <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> could pay to Pinnacle West. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 209 million in 1988 and $ 85.7 million in the third quarter of this year, and a 13,000-member group of stockholders of <ORGANIZATION> Pinnacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> urged in June that <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> be spun off. <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> officials on July 18 announced a turnaround plan for the savings bank, including layoffs, sales of subsidiaries and repossessed real estate, and tight restrictions on loan-making. While the plan is expected to reduce annual overhead to $ 80 million from $ 148 million within five years, <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> still expects to continue to lose money because of non-performing loans until the real estate market recovers. Pinnacle West bought <ORGANIZATION> MeraBank </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986 for $ 426 million.

 When <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> decided in 1986 to sell the grocery store chain bearing his name, he told his sister, who told her daughter, who told her husband, who told his stockbroker, who used the information to buy the company's stock. Broker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> was convicted of charges related to insider trading in a case experts say demonstrates the vagueness of federal securities laws. Although small by the standards of other <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky-era </PERSON> prosecutions, the <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> case sent a man to prison, caused turmoil in a well-known family business and raised issues possibly destined for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Factually, it's as straightforward as you could imagine,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotz </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney on the case. `` It involved one tip in one instance and one set of trades and then a pattern of coverup for several months afterward.'' Prosecutors say the case happened this way: On the Friday before Thanksgiving in 1986, <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> agreed to sell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 1921 to the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ better known as <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P _ for $ 50 a share, or $ 28.7 million. The following Sunday, he told his sister, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Witkin </PERSON>, about the deal, stressing that the information had to remain confidential until it was announced publicly. <PERSON> Witkin </PERSON> went to a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> bank with one daughter to remove her Waldbaum stock certificates and later informed another daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, who in turn told her husband, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> then told stockbroker <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON>, who bought 11,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 25 each, making overnight profits of $ 250,000 for himself and several clients, including <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, alerted to the trading by routine post-merger stock market surveillance, filed civil charges. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> cooperated with investigators. <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> was charged criminally and convicted by a jury last March on 31 counts. The Waldbaum case was n't a big-money swindle. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, who with his wife legitimately made $ 1.6 million on family shares from the A & amp; P deal, earned $ 22,000 from the illicit trades, which occurred just 12 days after <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> admitted to the largest insider trading ring ever. The case expanded securities law interpretation to encompass disclosure of secrets down a lengthy chain of tipsters. No prior criminal case had involved confidential information passed among several family members. At issue is whether confidentiality carries down from a corporate inner sanctum. Does a family member who works outside the company have any duty to the corporation? Does that duty transfer to an outsider who profits from nonpublic information? `` The problem here is information is inherently leaking,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` At some point it becomes a market rumor. This is in that zone where it is a little bit more specific than a market rumor.'' <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> took over six <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> grocery stores in 1947 after his father died, expanding <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> into a 137-supermarket chain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The family owned more than 60 percent when <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> was sold to A & amp; P. Testimony at the federal court trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> last spring revealed that <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> ran the company tightly but that the family was n't particularly close. <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> had trouble telling his two nieces apart and visited his 90-year-old mother just a few times a year, testimony showed. The business nonetheless was a family affair, so <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> got word out about the company's sale _ a legal disclosure under securities law. All family members were told to keep the information secret. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> testified he called <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and his broker since 1982, on the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 26. `` I told him that <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s is about to be sold and it would be substantially higher than it was currently trading at,'' he said. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> did not cite his source or say the information was confidential. Brokerage records show <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> bought 3,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION> stock for himself that day and 8,000 for <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> and other clients, at prices ranging from $ 24.62 -LCB- to $ 26 a share. The sale to A & amp; P was announced after the close of the market. By the end of the next business day, <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION> stock had surged to $ 49 a share. <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> denied talking to <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> on Wednesday morning. The timing of <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON>'s stock purchases, lawyers said, was a `` staggering coincidence.'' He bought the shares because <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION> trading volume was high and the company was sound. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> testified that shortly after the sale he became nervous and even asked <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> if he could rescind the trades. After learning of an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> inquiry, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> admitted to lying to a <LOCATION> Waldbaum </LOCATION> lawyer about the trades. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> a list of buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION> stock that Wednesday including <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierchio </PERSON>, another nephew by marriage. `` I would say I was rather surprised,'' <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> paid the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 45,000 in alleged illegal profits and penalties. <PERSON> Sierchio </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities lawyer, paid a total of $ 123,000 and was not prosecuted. <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON>'s conviction hinged on whether <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> had a duty to the Waldbaum company via the family and whether <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> knew he was breaching it. The government argued that <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> had a duty to his wife, who had a duty to her mother, who had a duty to <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>, who had a duty to the company. But <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Elkan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> said: `` That's too flimsy to be the basis for criminal action.'' `` There was no pre-existing relationship of trust and confidence established beyond the fact that these people were related,'' <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> argued before the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told the three-judge panel that all family members were intertwined in a legal bond, and <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON> knew it. `` He's taking the rap for the breach of a family relationship,'' Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said in questioning <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. `` No, he's taking the rap, your honor, for taking stolen information and trading on it,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Chestman </PERSON>, 42, began serving a two-year sentence shortly after conviction, rather than wait for the appeal to finish. He is eligible for parole from a minimum-security prison in <LOCATION> Allenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in February. Civil charges are pending. <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> said his client, whose wife and three children live on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, felt he could n't get a job until the case was behind him so he decided to serve time as soon as possible. He said the Chestmans were devastated by the case. `` I've never had anybody as affected by the criminal process as this particular family was,'' <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> said. `` Dreadful.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday announced they have called off negotiations on <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s possible takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>, a carrier that has lost business due to the problems at <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Risley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s vice president for corporate affairs, said the companies mutually decided to end negotiations Tuesday and that <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has withdrawn its cash plus stock offer for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Basically both parties negotiated in good faith for a good deal of time and there were just a couple of issues that could not be agreed upon,'' he said. <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> declined to discuss specifically why the airlines terminated the negotiations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, also declined to discuss why the negotiations broke down. `` Both parties negotiated in good faith. When you're working on a definitive merger agreement there are a lot of points. We just could n't agree on some of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said he did not know whether other companies were waiting to approach Air Midwest with takeover proposals. Air Midwest's board in June rejected <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 31 million buyout offer. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> on Oct. 12 sent a letter to <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> asking to enter into an exclusive agreement that would lead to an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s negotiating suggestion of $ 6.34 per share of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> stock, based on the market price at the time the letter was sent, calculated to more than $ 24 million <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> would have given <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> flights that travel from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Air Midwest has 42 airplanes and serves 39 cities in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The airline was hit hard by the recent bankruptcy reorganization attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which on Tuesday announced it was grounding its last 46 daily flights and laying off its remaining 1,800 employees. Air Midwest provided connector flights to <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s hub in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and about half of its revenue was from ties with <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> is trying to sell seven <ORGANIZATION> SAAB </ORGANIZATION> 340 aircraft that became surplus planes when the <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> feeder flights ended. Air Midwest laid off 165 workers on Oct. 5, on the heels of a 30-worker layoff earlier that week. The cuts were intended to save about $ 200,000 a month. The airline has not laid off any more employees since then. During the second quarter of this year, the latest period for which figures were available, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.6 million, nearly four times the earnings for the same quarter in 1988. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has 16 airplanes serving 25 cities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Skyway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>, has six airplanes serving 15 cities in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> acquired Skyway in April. <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> does not own any <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> stock. <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> owns more than 13 percent of the airline's stock, or about 509,000 shares. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> on Aug. 4 reported net income of $ 101,546, or 6 cents a share, on revenue of more than $ 5.8 million for its third fiscal quarter that ended June 30. The company reported net income of $ 3,492 on revenue of more than $ 4 million for the same period that ended June 30, 1988. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> last month rejected a merger proposed by a smaller carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Stateswest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, which serves communities in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> said he could not comment on whether <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> was looking to acquire other specific airlines, but said the company is `` always looking for good investment opportunities that would allow us to expand beyond what we have now.''

 Collective bargaining agreements covering 3 million workers will expire or be subject to renegotiation in 1990, including 2.1 million workers in private industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The department's forecast of 1990 bargaining activity said the upcoming negotiations would involve 884,000 of the 2.5 million workers under major contract agreements in state and local governments. The 2.1 million private-industry workers whose contracts are up for bargaining in 1990 represent 35 percent of the 6 million workers in that sector covered by major collective bargaining agreements. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> defines major agreements as those covering at least 1,000 workers. In private industry, the largest groups affected by the negotiations will be construction workers, with contracts covering 409,000 up for bargaining, and in transportation equipment, with 595,000 workers affected, most of them at automobile manufacturers.

 The stock market rose sharply today, extending Tuesday's rally on signs of a new move toward a more stimulative <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> credit policy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 14.96 on Tuesday, climbed 32.79 to 2,629.92 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.

News accounts this morning quoted unnamed government officials as saying that inference was correct.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> headed today toward a final vote on a compromise plan to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour, which some Republicans claimed would hurt the economy and cost young workers their jobs. `` There is unanimous agreement, except among politicians, that this is not the thing to do,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. C, citing studies that a higher minimum wage likely would fuel inflation and make marginal businesses less likely to hire new `` So what do politicians do? They go ahead and do it.'' The opposition of <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other Republicans notwithstanding, the compromise plan agreed to by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats was expcted to win final passage by day's end. The vote originally was planned for Tuesday but negotiations on a plan to raise the federal debt limit stalled the minimum-wage debate. That logjam was broken late Tuesday and the minimum-wage bill was the first order of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> business today. Several GOP senators were mulling amendments, despite an attempt by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to persuade them not to offer any. If offered, none was expected to pass but debate on them would delay a final vote, still expected later today. The compromise, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week, would raise the wage floor for the first time since it reached $ 3.35 an hour in 1981. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, in a letter Tuesday, reminded senators the administration supported the compromise approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and `` accordingly I ask for your support of this same bill now before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with no amendments attached.'' Aides to Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said he planned to offer an amendment to exempt small businesses from the increase in the minimum wage. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said today he also might offer an amendment but did not offer details. The minimum wage, paid to an estimated 4 million Americans, would rise to $ 3.80 next April 1 and to $ 4.25 a year later under the legislation. It also would create a subminimum for workers 16 to 19 years old new to the job market. All workers in that age group could be paid the subminimum for their first three months of work experience and up to six months provided they were in certified training programs for the final three months. The subminimum would be $ 3.35 when the minimum wage rose to $ 3.80. It would rise to $ 3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $ 4.25. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

 Grain and soybean futures were mixed in sluggish trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn futures closed within a one cent range as traders settled back to wait for the release Thursday of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s crop production report.

<HEAD>Net Farm Income To Fall, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARROLL, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> net farm income will decline steadily through 1996 from its current record heights, researchers said Wednesday. The projections include forecasts of falling government subsidies, declining soybean prices and generally stable prices for cattle, hogs and corn. The Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> predicted a 27 percent drop in net farm income by 1996, but said that still would leave the income figure higher than in any year before 1986. When adjusted for inflation, however, the drop is steeper. Net farm income represents agriculture's contribution to the gross national product. It measures the return to farmers for their labor and management of farms and households. The projections were released at the institute's fall agribusiness outlook and policy conference in this west-central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farm community. The institute is a joint program of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Westhoff </PERSON>, a research associate at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> center </ORGANIZATION>, said the forecast is designed as a reference point for policy makers as they prepare a new federal farm program for 1990, when the 1985 law expires. One basic assumption is that current domestic and foreign agricultural policies are continued. The impact of any policy changes then could be measured against the projections, <PERSON> Westhoff </PERSON> told the conference. The institute predicts: _ Net farm income will rise to approximately $ 49.2 billion this year from $ 45.7 billion last year, then fall to about $ 36 billion by 1996 After adjusting for inflation by measuring net farm income in terms of the buying power of the dollar in 1967, the forecast projects a 43 percent slide, from $ 14.6 billion in 1989 to $ 8.4 billion in 1996. _ Government payments to farmers will fall from an estimated $ 10.5 billion in 1989 to almost $ 5.8 billion in 1996 _ Cash receipts from sales of crops and livestock will rise 16 percent, to $ 180.4 billion from $ 155.6 billion Production expenses will rise 24 percent, to $ 170.4 billion from $ 137.4 billion. _ Corn prices will average $ 2.18 per bushel in the marketing year that ends next August, and $ 2.19 per bushel in the year that ends in August 1996 In the meantime, prices range from $ 1.99 per bushel in the 1991-92 marketing year to $ 2.20 in 1993-94. _ Soybean prices should average $ 5.78 per bushel in the current marketing year and $ 6.34 in 1995-96, dropping as low as $ 5.26 in 1990-91 _ Prices of slaughter steers at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> should average $ 72.33 per 100 pounds this year, rising to $ 79.32 in 1996, with a low of $ 69.48 in 1995 _ Prices of butcher hogs should average $ 42.30 per 100 pounds this year and rise to $ 45.40 in 1996, with a low of $ 40.74 in 1992 and a high of $ 45.95 in 1994

<HEAD>Short Supplies Forcing Milk Prices to Record Levels This Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought, dropping production and changes in consumer tastes are forcing Americans to pay more for milk at the supermarket and creating shortages for some dairy processors. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail milk prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> averaged $ 1.27 per half gallon in October, the highest level this decade. Prices for milk, cheese and other dairy products have been increasing this fall at a pace 50 percent faster than the overall Consumer Price Index during that time, the bureau said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an agricultural economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said retail milk prices probably would continue to increase through the end of this year, although consumers may see lower prices in the spring. In parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> reported that milk now costs as much as $ 2.55 a gallon. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>, executive director of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has warned that the increases might make milk too expensive for lower-income families `` It's becoming a very expensive commodity,'' said <PERSON> Kessel </PERSON>. `` I think that when you recognize the fact that milk is probably the most important staple for any American family, you see the rising prices of milk at the retail level is very disturbing.'' Dairy industry experts say American consumers still are paying for the drought of 1988, which scorched farmland in parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the Northeast. The quality of feed grown during that summer was inferior to previous crops and the milk production of cows feeding on those grains has been below average. According to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, American farmers produced 1 percent less milk in August than they did in August 1988. In September, milk production was off 2 percent from the same month last year. Fewer dairy cows are producing milk in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now than in the mid 1980s. Some 1.6 million head of dairy cattle were taken out of milk production under the federal buyout program designed to trim <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> milk surpluses. The production decline has been accentuated by an increase in the amount of milk being used for making cheese, which reflects increased consumer demand for that product, according to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, an agricultural economist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, director of regulatory affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said tight milk supplies also stemmed partly from commitments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> processors to supply nonfat dry milk to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other foreign countries. When American milk production unexpectedly began to tail off midway through this year, some processors had to scramble to get enough milk to produce as much cheese, nonfat dry milk, butter, ice cream and other domestic dairy products, <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. Plants that might be operating normally at 90 percent to 95 percent of capacity might have to operate at 75 percent if they were unable to buy as much milk as they wanted, he said. `` Is that a shortage? I do n't really see that as a shortage of milk,'' he said. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said about half the milk produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is sold fresh in stores. There will be enough milk meet that demand for the next several months, he said, until the traditional spring production surplus wipes out any short supplies. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicts prices will plunge dramatically by spring, when milk prices traditionally reach their lows of the year due to peak supply and slack demand. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cropp </PERSON>, a farm economist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Platteville </ORGANIZATION>, projects that the upward price trend will last until about mid-February, when a decline will start as the traditional spring milk `` flush'' approaches. The beneficiaries of the recent price increases are the American dairy farmers who've struggled to make money for most of this decade while milk prices have been stable _ or even dropped _ and production costs have increased. The base price for milk produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, determined by processors in the leading milk-producing states of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, has increased from $ 10.98 per hundred pounds in March to $ 13.87 per hundred pounds in October. That price is boosted further by regional premiums added by federal milk-price regulating boards around the country. The Minnesota-Wisconsin price in October was $ 1.99 per hundred pounds higher than the base milk price in October 1988.

<HEAD>Walter Industries Refinancing Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> wants to refinance $ 624.3 million in debt before Jan. 1, when interest rates on the junk bonds are scheduled to be reset. The move, announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is designed to buy time for the construction and building-supplies company. If the holding company fails to restructure the debt before Jan. 1, when the interest rates are reset some bondholders are likely to demand high yields that could saddle <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> with interest costs it ca n't afford. <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> announced a plan to ask its junk bondholders to swap existing bonds for a package of new bonds and varying amounts of cash. The new bonds would carry a slightly higher interest rate of around 18 percent and be accompanied by cash payments of $ 3 or $ 5. Interest rates on those bonds also would be subject to future adjustment _ but not until Nov. 1, 1990, giving the company 10 more months of breathing room. Bondholders have until Dec. 5 to exchange their holdings. The plan is contingent on the willingness of 80 percent of junk bondholders to swap. `` What it comes down to is we're faced with interest rates we do n't think the bonds deserve,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, spokesman for Tampa-based <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is compounded by the fact that the market is volatile.'' <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> said its refinancing package `` would better insulate the company from possible distortions in its capital structure that could be caused by current market conditions.'' The company added that its operations are `` presently strong and performing according to plan.'' The bonds are part of a $ 1.1 billion junk-bond financing package used last year to take <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Corp. </PERSON>, private in a leveraged buyout. The acquisition of the publicly held company was orchestrated by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, and the bond financing was managed by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The prices of junk bonds are depressed, a result of turmoil caused by defaults and near-defaults by some companies that issued junk bonds. <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>'s bond prices also are low because of renewed concern about its asbestos liability stemming from a lawsuit filed earlier this year. A Hillsborough junk bond that was sold last year with a face value of $ 100 was priced at the end of last month about $ 55. Meeting the Jan. 1 bond value would force the company to pay an interest rate of more than 40 percent, said <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Penniman </PERSON>, managing director of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Crisanti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Maffei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> junk bond investment adviser. `` There's no way they can reset these.''

<TEXT>
 Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and <ORGANIZATION> Condor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday amid reports the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board of directors has given its chairman permission to explore the possibility of a buyout or recapitalization of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent. The meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was held only to hear what <PERSON> Condor </PERSON> is planning for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> of the Machinists, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union representing 25,000 of its 70,000 workers. He said the union was not seeking to reach any immediate agreements with Condor, which was formed by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment group that announced last week it had accumulated a 9.7 percent stake in Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> refused to elaborate on the substance of Wednesday's meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, whose opposition contributed to the October collapse of a pilot-management buyout proposal. <PERSON> Condor </PERSON> was established to solicit majority support from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> shareholders for <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to reduce <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board from 16 members to five, three of whom would be <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> principals. With control of the board, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> could direct <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> toward a sale, restructuring or recapitalization. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> _ then the majority shareholder _ helped force a restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, then called <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> Meanwhile Wednesday, published reports indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board had cleared Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> to explore new means of mounting a buyout or recapitalization of the company. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said he was familiar with the reports, but had no comment. `` In any event, there has been no change in our plans'' to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, he said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We've been talking to all interested parties and will continue to do so.'' The reports concerning <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> were confirmed by <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which spearheaded the failed pilot-management bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to elaborate. But <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots are `` continuing to explore any and all options in its effort to gain employee control of the airline.'' The pilots union has held talks with management, he said. `` All I can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership with the current management team,'' but would not exclude an effort with other parties, <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board's action regarding <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> was not surprising or new. He noted the board had issued a vague statement last month suggesting <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> get on with managing the company and indicating it would not consider any offer under $ 300 a share _ the per-share price of the failed $ 6.75 billion bid. <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said he believes <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management has been pursuing another buyout offer or recapitalization since the announcement last month that the pilot-management group was unable to secure financing. `` I suspect that it -LRB- another buyout bid -RRB- has been progressing all along and has moved from Act One to Act Two,'' he said. The announcement of the collapse of the pilot-management deal on Oct. 13 helped trigger a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials. <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said the Machinists' meeting with Condor principals was part of a union effort to discover some way to put <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> back on stable ground and end the bidding war, which the union contends would lead to overwhelming debt for the nation's second-largest carrier. He said the Machinists would not participate in any deal that would give the pilots control of the airline, but had not ruled out a compromise on the magnitude of employee ownership.

<HEAD>Kansas City Wants Late Gate Fees from Braniff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City officials said Wednesday that if <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> does n't pay $ 1.8 million in overdue airport rental and gate fees by Nov. 28 it risks losing its gates at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will file a motion in federal bankruptcy court next week demanding the payment and will resist any effort by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> to extend the deadline, said Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Nordahl </PERSON> <PERSON> Holte </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern that the airport gates would be unused for a long time as <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> moves through bankruptcy court. Airline officials were unavailable for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors on Sept. 28. The <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, Fla.-based airline canceled its remaining flights at midnight Monday due to a severe cash shortage and said it would dismiss most of its remaining 1,800 employees. Under federal bankruptcy law, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has 60 days from its Sept. 28 filing to decide whether to pay the airport fees, give up the gates or seek an extension. If <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> does not pay, a lender that loaned <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> money before bankruptcy would have the option of taking over the leases. If the lender declines to pay the bills by Dec. 28, the city would be free to offer the gate space to other airlines. Seprately, the head of a concern that planned to acquire the airline said those plans had changed since <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s virtual shutdown. <PERSON> Farhad </PERSON> <PERSON> Azima </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> City-based <ORGANIZATION> Aviatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said he still would consider using some of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to operate a passenger airline service, focused principally on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But hopes of renewing service through <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> have ended, he said. `` Based on the present situation, we have to look at it in a different view than as a going concern,'' he said. `` Our plan -LRB- to revive <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is no longer applicable. We will look at its assets but no longer look at it as a going concern.'' The airline's decision to stop air service makes restarting it too difficult, he said. <PERSON> Azima </PERSON> plans to meet with his investment bankers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week to decide whether to become involved in <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization.

 The stock market ran up a broad gain Wednesday, extending Tuesday's rally on signs of a new move toward a more stimulative <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> credit policy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 14.96 on Tuesday, climbed 26.23 points to 2,623.36. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,091 up, 418 down and 463 unchanged. Stocks turned upward Tuesday on evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was taking steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to decline. News accounts this morning quoted unnamed government officials as saying that inference was correct. Analysts said that encouraged stock traders who had been growing increasingly apprehensive about the possibility of a recession. Wall Streeters still expect corporate profits, which came in below expectations for the third quarter, to be disappointing for the next few months. But the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could presumably cushion the impact of an economic slowdown in the future by relaxing its credit policy now. A relatively small <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> bank lowered its prime lending rate from 10 -LCB- percent to 10 percent, helping to stir expectations that bigger money-center banks might soon do the same. Bank stocks were notably strong. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 ~ to 43 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Bankamerica </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to 28 |; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to 37, and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> 1 Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 41 |; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 at 54 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 | at 129 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 \ at 74 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- But <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped | to 96 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> was down 1 -LCB- at 87. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 -LRB- to 58 \ amid some disappointment over the size of the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down -LRB- at 9 -RRB-. The stock traded as high as 12 -LCB- early in the session amid takeover rumors. Then it fell back when the company said it was discussing a possible acquisition at $ 10 a share with a party it did n't identify. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 170.15 million shares, against 163 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 202.37 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 30.38 billion, or 0.93 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.74 to 187.48. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 3.75 to 385.14, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.34 at 338.15 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 4.65 to 454.05. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 370.72, up 2.21.

 Weakness in the heating oil market led petroleum futures prices lower Wednesday in moderate trading. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the December contract for heating oil fell 1.11 cents to 58.72 cents a gallon, while the January contract slid 0.90 cent to 58.69 cents a gallon. Wholesale unleaded gasoline also declined. The December contract lost 0.54 cent to 51.87 cents a gallon and January fell 0.49 cent to 52.29 cents a gallon. The December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 15 cents to $ 19.87 a barrel. January crude moved down 11 cents to $ 19.68. Analysts said softness in the heating oil market stemmed forecasts for warmer weather and from weekly statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that showed supplies rose 1.9 million barrels last week to 120.6 million barrels. Although crude oil inventories fell by 3.9 million barrels overall to 341 million barrels, in some crucial production areas they increased. `` If you digest the numbers, you'll find there was some buildup of crude in two main areas, including <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, ab energy trader with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>.

 Labor officials have put at least two joint programs between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union on hold to protest the automaker's planned closing of a carmaking plant. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 7 at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Jefferson Avenue plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the union was stopping its participation in a quality improvement program and a training project. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced it would stop production of its <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> subcompact cars at the aging plant in February, idling 1,700 workers. The plant was scheduled to be phased out by 1992 to make way for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s new Jefferson North plant. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, echoing other <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> officials, said he felt betrayed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s action. The company has implemented a program to cut $ 1 billion in costs by the end of next year. Last year, the union threatened to pull out of similar joint programs to protest <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts-making operation. The company dropped its sale plans.

 The dollar rose modestly against most major currencies Wednesday, showing resilience in the face of expectations of declining interest rates. Gold prices also advanced. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid for gold at 4 p.m. EST of $ 387.50 a troy ounce, up from $ 384.75 late Tuesday. Currency traders said the dollar showed fundamental strength despite the market's perception that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is relaxing its credit policy, which likely would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress the dollar's value. That perception was fueled by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action in the bond market on Monday and Tuesday, when it unexpectedly injected several billion dollars of reserves into the market. `` The dollar is basically absorbing the lower interest-rate scenario rather well,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a vice president of corporate trading at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's hanging in there.'' He noted that traders are looking toward Thursday's government report on wholesale price inflation in October for further signs of an economic slowdown, which could spur the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease credit further. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 142.97 Japanese yen from 143.63 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it declined further to 142.73 yen. But in trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar recovered and finished at 143.18 yen, up from 142.95 yen late Tuesday. The British pound rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.5860 from $ 1.5810 late Tuesday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.5885, up from $ 1.5865 the day before. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8445 West German marks, up from 1.8430; 1.6168 Swiss francs, up from 1.6165; 6.2515 French francs, up from 6.2470; 1,347.25 Italian lire, down from 1,348.00; and 1.1698 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1712 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8450 West German marks, up from 1.8442; 1.6170 Swiss francs, down from 1.6175; 6.2510 French francs, down from 6.2520; 2.0805 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,349.50 Italian lire, up from 1,349.00; and, 1.1695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1705 Gold bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 384.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 384.50 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the metal was unchanged from Tuesday, closing at a bid of $ 384.00. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 6.23 to close at $ 387.80. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold contracts for current delivery closed at $ 388.80 a troy ounce, up from $ 386.20 on Tuesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave final passage Wednesday to legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.25 by April 1991, the first increase in the floor wage since 1981. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to sign the bill next week. The 89-8 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote came eight days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats agreed on the plan to boost the minimum wage by 45 cents next April 1 and another 45 cents a year later. The measure, passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week, also creates a new, subminimum wage that could be paid to teen-agers for their first three months in the work force and up to three months more for those in certified training or education programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature will not only trigger the first increase in the minimum wage in nearly a decade but also will end a bitter stalemate between congressional Democrats and successive Republican administrations over the politically charged issue. `` The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a key architect of the compromise `` The working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not as much as they deserve.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> promised to return to the issue and seek another increase as the 1992 presidential election nears. Democrats may try to use the issue against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then, but on Wednesday they had praise for the president. `` We all owe a debt of gratitude to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who was willing to stand up and support a minimum wage increase, thereby reversing the policy of the prior administration, which had consistently opposed any increase,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, one of two Republicans who unsuccessfully sought to amend the measure, credited Democrats and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> with a victory over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the compromise talks. `` He's won with the president,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>. `` He got the president to come his way.'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the labor federation was `` delighted that the compromise bill to raise the minimum wage has cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and is on its way to the president's desk. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a raise and this long overdue step will give them a chance to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.'' The final vote came afer <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and a handful of other conservative Republicans long opposed to any increase made a spirited rhetorical effort to derail the compromise by defeating or amending it. `` The fact is that this legislation will not help the people it says it is supposed to help, those people at the bottom of the economic ladder,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho. But even the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders, citing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deal with the Democrats, frowned on the amendment efforts. `` The president made an agreement,'' Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said in urging his colleagues not to support amendments. The minimum wage, frozen at $ 3.35 an hour since January 1981, is paid to about 4 million American workers. But the legislation likely will have a broader impact by driving up the wages of workers who now make slightly more than the minimum wage, particularly those covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such wage inflation was a major concern of Republicans and business interests who opposed any increase in the minimum wage. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promise to support one left them hobbled in their efforts to block a boost, one of organized labor's top priorities throughout the 1980s. Labor, on the other hand, which failed to win an increase during the eight-year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and lost in its first fight with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the issue, was forced to drop its longstanding opposition to any subminimum wage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in June vetoed a Democratic-backed bill calling for an increase to $ 4.55 and, as his veto was sustained, said he would not budge from his offer of an increase to $ 4.25 an hour by January 1992 provided employers could pay all newly hired workers a subminimum for up to six months. The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, under increasing pressure from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into an election year, two weeks ago signaled a willingness to strike a deal, and both sides made concessions leading to the compromise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed to a timetable reaching the $ 4.25 level nine months before he had proposed and also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than he had demanded. The compromise limits application of the subminimum to workers 16-19 years old, requires actual skills training for it to be paid to those with more than three months work experience and prevents it being paid to any worker with six months total experience. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in April 1993. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to all workers, regardless of age, for their first six months on any new job, regardless of past work experience. Labor and the Democratic sponsors of the increase, in addition to accepting the new subminimum, lowered their final target for the increase _ at one time more than $ 5 _ to $ 4.25 an hour. They also gave up demands for a commission to report annually on whether additional boosts were needed. Opponents of any increase feared such a panel would become a lobbying arm for annual confrontations on the issue. All eight senators voting againt the measure were Republicans. They were Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to plead guilty next week to two felony charges of unauthorized conveyance of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget documents, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said Tuesday. The Seattle-based aerospace company has agreed to enter the pleas in connection with obtaining two budget documents, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s planned plea has been widely reported over the past week. A court document states that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which was the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s 10th-largest contractor with $ 3 billion worth of business last year, is scheduled to enter a pre-indictment plea Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> According to another court filing, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is an unindicted co-conspirator of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a former company marketing analyst awaiting trial on charges of obtaining more than 100 Pentagon documents between 1979 and 1985. Many of the documents <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> obtained were classified, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, declined to comment on the case. The documents <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who worked as a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> employee before joining <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of giving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> include material on former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative. Under the terms of the guilty plea being negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could still take steps to bar the company from future defense contracts, according to the sources. The company has agreed to reimburse the government for the cost of the investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON> said a decision on whether to bar <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> from bidding on future contracts would be made as part of an administrative proceeding conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not an automatic thing,'' he said. But a decision to debar <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would apply to all Pentagon procurement, not just <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contracts, he said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, deputy assistant inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said that if a contractor agrees to take adequate corrective measures, `` there's a good chance the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will not take any action.'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> is to go on trial Dec. 4 on charges of conspiracy, conveyance without authority, mail fraud and conversion of government property. He has declined to comment about the case. He is accused of obtaining detailed budget documents for various <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> programs, including a five-year plan for the Pentagon. Such material would help a defense company submit bids for government contracts. Prosecutors allege that while the indictment charges Folwer with obtaining 110 documents for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, he procured more than 600 classified documents for the defense contractor over the six-year period. In doing so, he was able to give <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> `` a comprehensive picture of the internal dynamics'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s planning and budgeting system, prosecutors say in court documents obtained by The Morning News Tribune of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Court files contain a 1986 interview with <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials as part of an internal inquiry conducted at the direction of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said in the interview that he received calls from managers in various <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> divisions asking him to get the Pentagon planning and budget documents. Asked if he was pressured into obtaining them, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> replied, `` No, that's what I was hired to do.'' In another statement, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said he considered it an accepted practice throughout the defense industry to acquire such information. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s classification practices, saying that some papers were overclassified and others were classified for political rather than security reasons. Sometimes information would be classified in one document and unclassified in another, he said. `` I never consciously believed that the data extracted from <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> documents, in spite of the classification, was in fact classified, nor would the data in any way compromise the security of the nation,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Electronics Groups Form HDTV Cooperation Committees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese electronics industry group has offered to share information about advanced high-definition television with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers to allow them to produce components for Japanese-developed HDTV systems, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry officials said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> said it `` would welcome the active participation of foreign-based semiconductor manufacturers'' in HDTV, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. HDTV, which uses large numbers of semiconductor chips to produce images as clear as in movie theaters, is seen by some analysts as a key element of the consumer electronics industry's future. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> office, said the two industry groups agreed in talks Tuesday night to establish committees on HDTV cooperation and technical exchange. He said the committees would `` provide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers with an opportunity'' to supply chips for Japanese HDTV manufacturers. `` We do n't see that there are formal barriers to participation,'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We sense a cooperative attitude.'' He said the talks were not likely to have an immediate effect on sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because HDTV equipment is still at the prototype stage. `` But we hope it will encourage more design activity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers, he said. More <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> designs of HDTV chips for Japanese manufacturers `` should show up in volume business later,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, chairman of the semiconductor group, said Tuesday that Japanese companies and government agencies have stepped up their efforts in recent months to increase purchases of foreign semiconductors, but that foreign chips still have only a 11.2 percent share of the Japanese market. `` I'm optimistic these new efforts and this new openness is going to result in a very real increase in market share for American companies,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pledged in semiconductor negotiations in 1986 to boost the share of foreign chips in the Japanese market to more than 20 percent within five years, but <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> officials say the figure was a goal, not a commitment.

<TEXT>
 The debate over whether computerized program trading is good or bad for the stock market moves to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday with former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> and other Wall Street heavy hitters testifying before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that will hear <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> plans to introduce legislation to restrict program trading during market drops. But a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader said Wednesday that there wo n't be enough time to shoehorn a program trading ban into pending legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for the holidays. Program trading _ rapid-fire transactions through computerized buy and sell programs _ has been a topic of dispute for years but the debate heated up again after the Oct. 13 stock market slide. When the Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average dropped more than 190 points on that Friday the 13th, many critics said the situation was worsened by program trading, especially one form _ index arbitrage _ in which speculators try to take advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other. Critics believe the computerized trading strategy also creates wild price swings, and that, in turn, has driven small investors out of the market. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has called on large, institutional investors to curb program trading while it considers ways to handle the bursts of stock orders it generates. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, a former head of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has likened program trading to casino gambling and told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee last year that index arbitrage was to blame for the 1987 stock market crash. He is expected to express a similar view Thursday to a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, said he called the session `` to hear from those who have firsthand experience with the destructive impacts of such program trading strategies. In addition to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, other witnesses scheduled to appear before the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance include: <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, chairman of the financial newspaper, Investor's Daily; <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tozer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timbers </PERSON>, chief investment officer of <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> is introducing an amendment to pending market reform legislation that would halt program trading in times of extreme market turbulence `` There has been an unprecedented outcry over program trading by the nation's investment community in the days since the Oct. 13 market collapse,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee. But at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the securities subcommittee, said he did n't think there was enough time to add a program trading ban and still get the legislation passed before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` I could not get the bill out with program trading,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> told a press briefing Wednesday. `` There are just too many members of the committee who have strong reservations about the program trading piece.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> added: `` It's important that this Congress not let time go by without expressing its view'' on market reforms. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s amendment would grant emergency powers to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to temporarilly halt program trading during wide market price swings. The amendment would be added to the Stock Market Reform Act of 1989, which is pending before the subcommittee. That bill calls for four major reforms: giving the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> authority to halt trading in market emergencies; requiring reports of large securities and options trades; and rules for assessing the financial stability of the parent companies of broker-dealers. A similar bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Drop With Release of Inventory Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices slid Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders shrugged off news that petroleum stocks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined. On other markets, grain and soybeans and precious metals were mixed, copper declined slightly and livestock and pork futures mostly higher. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 15 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 19.87 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent to 1.13 cents lower with December at 58.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .49 cent to .54 cent lower with December at 51.87 cents a gallon. The selling was spurred by bearish inventory data from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> which showed a 3.98-million-barrel draw on crude stocks to 341 million barrels. `` Most of the stock drawdown occurred on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, while stocks actually increased in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> regions,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Adding to selloff pressure was the weakness in heating oil, which in recent weeks has provided a steadying force in the market. The weakness in heating oil was due to a increase in stocks, <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said. Copper futures prices were higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as uncertainty continues around labor activity at <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s Chuquicamata mine, the world's largest open-pit mine Miners have threatened a strike vote if the government passed a law reorganizing state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Chile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the mine. The reorganization could lessen the influence of the unions, analysts say. Copper was 1.50 cents to 3.90 cents higher with November at $ 1.1545 a pound. Precious metal prices settled mixed on the Comex. Gold prices were up because of strong overseas demand, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Prices were also supported by an expected decline in key interest rates. Silver trading was restrained on reports of high stocks in Comex-approved warehouses, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Gold was $ 2.40 to $ 2.80 higher with November at $ 388.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent lower to unchanged with November at $ 5.265 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures were mixed in sluggish trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn futures closed within a one-cent range as traders settled back to wait for the release Thursday of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s crop production report. The report is expected to contain an upward revision in this year's corn production. News that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> entered the market Tuesday night for about 200,000 metric tons of corn did not provide a stimulus to the market, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Soybean futures prices were little changed from Tuesday, with the buildup of soybean stocks putting pressure on prices. Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop report is expected to show an increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean production, which also weighed on prices. Wheat prices were stable despite the failure of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to show up in the market as has been expected, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.03 -RCB- a bushel; corn was a -LCB- cent lower to unchanged with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 1.42 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with November at $ 5.63 Livestock and pork futures closed mixed in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were slightly higher because of a strong cash market, but price strength was limited by lower wholesale beef prices. Feeder cattle also were higher because of the reduction of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariff on imported feeder cattle from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Hog futures were lower on a weaker cash market, and bellies were higher because of the lighter than expected movement of bellies into storage. Live cattle were .10 cent to .25 cent higher with December at 74.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .25 cent higher with November at 83.12 a pound; hogs were .52 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December at 47.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.92 cents higher with February at 63.47 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had received government clearance to include four railroads controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in its bid to acquire the Connecticut-based paper products company. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said such a clearance by the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is required when the holder of a railroad seeks to acquire another.

<HEAD>Comptroller Wants Thrift's Art Collection Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s top banking regulator tried again Wednesday to push a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> savings and loan into selling its $ 28 million art collection, which includes a $ 13.2 million Rubens portrait. State Comptroller <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> filed a 14-page administrative complaint against <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and its chairman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, to turn over the collection to a qualified art expert approved by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' office. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> contends the art purchases were an unauthorized investment for a savings and loan, and in particular one that has lost millions of dollars in recent months. `` We're taking this action to expedite the sale of the collection,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in a statement from his office. `` By seeking an art expert, it is our intention to see that the institution gets the best possible price for these works.'' The collection, which consists of at least 25 pieces, includes `` Portrait of a Man in Armor as Mars,'' a work by 17th Century Dutch painter <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> which was bought by <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> for $ 13.2 million, according to the complaint. Telephone calls to <ORGANIZATION> Centrust </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday were unanswered. The comptroller's action comes seven months after he ordered <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> to sell the art. In an April 7 letter, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> gave the thrift six months to sell the artworks, but <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' office says only three pieces have been sold. In the new complaint, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase was an `` unsafe or unsound'' business practice because of the speculative nature of art. `` Respondents' purchase of the art collection constitutes practices and conduct contrary to generally accepted standards applicable to a savings association, especially for an insured financial institution that lost more than $ 29 million during the last 15 months,'' the complaint said. The thrift was given 21 days to challenge <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' proposed order. If challenged, the matter would be heard by an administrative law judge, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>. If <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> does not contest the complaint, a final order would be issued by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' office giving the thrift 10 days to turn over the art, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, reported Wednesday a net loss of $ 158 million in the third quarter, as its <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary continued to lose money. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its net income dropped to $ 458,000 from $ 67.4 million a year earlier as passenger traffic continued to decline on its <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> routes. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, parent of both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, again saw profits at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> offset by losses at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in bankruptcy reorganization since it was struck by its three unions on March 4. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said it lost $ 158 million, or $ 4.09 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, widened from a net loss of $ 114.1 million, or $ 3.05 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue fell to $ 1.67 billion from $ 2.19 billion. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of $ 522.8 million, or $ 13.51 a share, widened from a loss of $ 494.3 million, or $ 13.06 a share, in the same period of 1988. Nine-month revenue tumbled to $ 4.96 billion from $ 6.55 billion. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> recorded a third-quarter net loss of $ 185.2 million, widened from a loss of $ 112.9 million in the same quarter of 1988. Eastern's revenue for the latest quarter dropped to $ 305.7 million from $ 912.7 million. `` Eastern continued to successfully rebuild its operations during the third quarter at a rate well beyond expectations,'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said in a statement. `` While losses were substantial, they were well within projections, and reflect the costs of building back our operations.'' Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which reported its third-quarter results on Monday, more than doubled its earnings _ partly because of the sale of some assets. In the quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> had net income of $ 43.5 million on revenue of $ 1.34 billion, up from net income of $ 15.2 million on revenue of $ 1.26 billion in the same period in 1988. In late August, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said he was considering a sale of all or part of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> because its business was being hurt by the long-running strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Foret </PERSON> was named president of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> last week, replacing <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> who resigned after less than 10 months on the job. While remaining as <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, positions which <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> also held. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said its per-share earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to less than 1 cent from 47 cents in the third quarter of 1988. The latest results include a gain of $ 18.4 million from completion of the sale of a division of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which sells security, maintenance and other services to airlines, government agencies and the military. The subsidiary was purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter revenue slipped 1.9 percent to $ 1.02 billion from $ 1.04 billion a year earlier The company blamed the decline on continued falling passenger traffic between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, stemming from the December 1988 crash in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and on increased competition on flights within <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. EuroBerlin, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, started operating in the country about a year ago. The dollar's strength against European currencies during the period also depressed revenue somewhat, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, its largest subsidiary, reported a net loss of $ 21.9 million in the third quarter, compared with a net profit of $ 52.3 million a year earlier. `` Results for the third quarter _ our peak season _ were clearly disappointing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>. `` However, we are encouraged by the declining rate of revenue shortfall and the improving trend of future bookings.'' For the first nine months of the year, the parent company posted a net loss of $ 158.3 million, or $ 1.09 a share, widened from a net loss of $ 21 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same period in 1988. Nine-month revenue declined 2.4 percent to $ 2.66 billion from $ 2.73 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>London Office Rents Highest in Western World, Bank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has the most expensive office rents in the Western world, outstripping those of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Only <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> among the major financial centers has higher office costs than <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the central bank said. In terms of living expenses for the families of top executives, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is cheaper than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in line with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities, it said. The findings were published in the bank's quarterly bulletin. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office rents cost $ 157 a square foot per year, the article said. It put <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office rents at $ 103 a square foot, compared with $ 57 in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and $ 40 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s downtown. Office rents in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> came to $ 54 a square foot and in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, $ 35. Living expenses in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the bank said, are `` not far out of line with its main European counterparts or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, -LRB- and -RRB- considerably cheaper than <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. ...'' Studies of cost of living, staff, overhead, tax and property have shown that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> overall is a cheaper business location than <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the bank said. However, it warned that transportation congestion could make <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> less appealing as an international financial center. `` This congestion is likely to become a serious concern unless major improvements, currently under examination, can be made in the foreseeable future,'' it said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Index Falls</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning trading, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> erased early gains and fell back Thursday morning, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose marginally against the Japanese yen. The dollar ended the morning session at 143.02 yen. It higher at 143.33 yen, up 0.36 yen from Wednesday's 142.97-yen close here, but inched down while ranging from 142.98 to 143.33 yen during morning trading. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the currency closed at 143.20 yen overnight. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 23.42 points, or 0.07 percent, ending morning trading at 35,572.17. The index, which gained 325.13 points Wednesday, added 60.17 points shortly after the opening. The index started higher following an overnight gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average of 30 major issues in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but gradually fell back as market players decreased their buying amid uncertainties over interest rate movement, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> recovered yesterday following a rumor that domestic interest rates would n't go up further, nothing has changed in the Japanese economy,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other dealers said participants sold spot issues in exchange for arbitrage deals in an attempt to collect profits on the price gap between spot and future issues. This, they said, prompted the index's fall. In currency dealings, the dollar was moving narrowly due to uncertainties over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy after the currency's higher start, traders said. The dollar-yen rate will move tightly but nervously ahead of a rescheduled auction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, a dealer from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday rescheduled the quarterly auction of $ 56 billion in securities after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally approved an increase in the federal debt limit. Congressional delay forced the postponement of the auction.

 A judge on Wednesday approved the sale of the Chicago-to-St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> line of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, ending fears of a shutdown during the company's bankruptcy reorganization, its trustee said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> made final a tentative approval he had given last week to the purchase of CM & amp; W's north-south line for $ 21.5 million by <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> The sale was endangered, with the threat of a shutdown in service, late Tuesday when negotiations hit a snag, <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W trustee <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The snag occurred when <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the joint owner of facilities with <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W, demanded at least $ 350,000 from contracts signed before <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W declared bankruptcy in April 1988, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. But that dispute and several other minor ones were resolved Wednesday, he said. `` The closing is in the process of being completed right now,'' he said late Wednesday afternoon. `` We reached a resolution of the dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western after negotiations last night and this morning.'' <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> did not provide details on how the problem was resolved `` There will be continuation of service on the line from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> will take over the north-south line. Service will continue uninterrupted.'' CM & amp; W has 632 miles of track from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, with trackage rights into <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The purchase affects the 282-mile line running roughly from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> had said Tuesday that if negotiations to resolve the dispute were not completed before the parties went before <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> on Wednesday, the judge would probably have ordered the entire railroad shut down at midnight. About 100 businesses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would have been affected by a shutdown. An estimated 300,000 people annually also travel by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> on CM & amp; W track between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The sale of the north-south line to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> came during eleventh-hour negotiations last week. State officials stepped in to mediate the deal and avert a possible shutdown. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W's chief creditors, had asked the court to cancel the CM & amp; W contract with <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> on the north-south line because they said the railroad was continuing to lose money on passenger service and had no prospects for a successful reorganization <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said those creditors appeared to accept the deal and voiced no objections in court. <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 1 million in start-up expenses and assume responsibility for $ 11 million in loans the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> made last year to keep struggling CM & amp; W afloat. The state, in turn, agreed to reduce interest rates on the existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as forgive another $ 2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant. Negotiations continued with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to purchase the CM & amp; W east-west lines that are used to haul freight between <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON> cash proposal was expected to go before <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> on Dec. 4, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said.
