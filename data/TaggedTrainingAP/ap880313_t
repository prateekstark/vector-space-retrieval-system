<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s boss says the veteran salesman was fired because of his unseemly habit of wearing loud and ugly sport coats. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 62, had filed a discrimination suit to prove he was forced out because of his age. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said before he lost his job at <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> in May 1985, the dealership was undergoing a `` new image'' campaign and he was told to start wearing sport coats on the used car lot for a more professional look. The 30-year sales veteran promptly went shopping for two jackets he describes as a pale pink and a rainbow plaid. He said the latter has every color in it and goes well with his gray slacks or green or red or blue. `` I saw nothing wrong with them,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said in a sworn statement in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. At 6-foot-8, he said, he has to buy his clothes at specialty shops that fit tall men. And he wanted coats to go with his different trousers. `` So that's what I bought, you know, because I had gray pants, blue pants, green pants, every kind. So you had to have something to go with all of them.'' But his boss, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said that neither jacket went well with the image he was trying to create for his dealership. `` Rather than promote an image of professionalism, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s selections took the opposite direction,'' an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Darby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> said in court documents `` One jacket was multi-colored ... and the other was a loud fuchsia color.'' In the lawsuit, wryly dubbed `` the dress of a salesman'' in courthouse corridors, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> claims the dress code and other charges against him, including catnapping and snacking in the office, are pretexts to hide the real problem _ age bias. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, the oldest salesman and the dealership's top in used car sales in 1984, was replaced by a less experienced person in his 20s, was never reprimanded and had an excellent job performance record, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnellan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON>, acknowledged that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was among the best in the sales force. As a result, <PERSON> Sizemore </PERSON> said, there was no motive to fire <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> for age discrimination, only for his poor behavior. The case is expected to go to trial this month.

 A wallaroo apparently blinded by the milk of human kindness underwent cataract surgery by two doctors who volunteered their services and usually treat people. In Saturday's three-hour operation, Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, a family practitioner, and Dr. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON>, an ophthalmologist, removed a marble-sized cataract from the eye of the animal, a stocky kangaroo. The doctors tentatively declared the operation a success. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said an improper diet probably blinded the animal, named <PERSON> Menehuni </PERSON>, who apparently had been blind most of its seven to 11 years. Milk sugars collect in the eyes of wallaroos and cause cataracts because the animals can not break them down, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. `` This poor guy's condition illustrates the reason why most people should n't have exotic animals,'' <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> said. `` The people probably had no idea they were blinding their pet.'' State authorities took <PERSON> Menehuni </PERSON> from its owners and gave him to the Wildlife Way Station in the <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that cares for exotic and wild animals that are sick or abandoned. The surgery was performed for free at the station with the help of resident veterinarian <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santinelli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said it was the first time he had to worry about `` moving a patient's tail out of the way.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> was coming downstairs for some tea when she heard five shots in the middle of the night. Right away she thought of police Sgt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, sitting alone in a patrol car a block away, guarding the home of a threatened witness. `` I said, ` Oh my God, he's in trouble,''' she recalled. Now, sitting in her tidy living room in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> _ a middle-age woman afraid to give her last name _ mourns <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, 22, a rookie who police believe was slain on the orders of a jailed drug kingpin. And she mourns for her neighborhood of small wood-frame houses that once must have seemed promising to working-class people looking for a slice of prosperity. It does n't anymore. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> has been overwhelmed by drugs, especially crack, in an epidemic that reached a peak of violence in the murder of <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was guarding the home of a man who had complained about drug dealers. Although police have taken the neighborhood by storm in efforts to ferret out <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s killers and drive away the drug merchants, residents remain cynical and scared. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, solidly black and poor, has been a troubled neighborhood for a long time. It shows in peeling paint, sagging porches, abandoned storefronts. But things have taken a turn for the worse in the past few years and police, clergy and residents blame crack and the people who sell it. `` They have taken over, completely taken over,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spigner </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. `` Everywhere I go, there are complaints. Every community meeting I attend, the inevitable complaint is narcotics.'' The users commit other crimes to support their habits. Children, seeing drug dealers in flashy clothes and fancy cars, are drawn to the drug life. Lawbreakers are drawn to the neighborhood. And dealers engage in turf wars that endanger all around them. `` You hear gunshots here and you hear gunshots there,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who lost a new television set and a videocassette recorder in a burglary he blames on drug addicts. `` If I had the money, I'd move.'' When crack first spread through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> several years ago, experts said it was sold by small-time entrepreneurs who would buy an ounce of cocaine and process it into a flaky, smokable drug. But now officials say a new hierarchy of violent, well-armed drug kingpins is taking over the crack trade in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` It starts in a very low-key way,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who supervises the Street Research Unit of the state Division of Substance Abuse Services. An entrepreneur begins selling drugs in a neighborhood and builds up a reputation. Buyers begin driving into the neighborhood. After a while, the dealer's success comes to the attention of a nearby drug gang. They make him an offer that he ca n't refuse, `` Work for us or get killed.'' `` Once that organized group comes in there, you're dealing with guns and it's not easy to get rid of,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. What makes a neighborhood susceptible to drug infestation, beyond having at least some drug users? <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshers </PERSON>, a demographer at <ORGANIZATION> Queens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, believes that an influx of different ethnic groups into a neighborhood can create a breakdown in the social structure that is conducive to illegal activity. `` You get a loss of communication,'' <PERSON> Beshers </PERSON> said. He noted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> has seen an influx of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and West Indian immigrants who ca n't necessarily communicate well with each other or with the established residents, mostly blacks who grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or in the South. For <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spigner </PERSON>, the reason for the infestation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> is more prosaic: `` The police just allowed it to exist. They just accepted it, and it became entrenched, it became institutionalized.'' The Police Department, shocked by <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s murder, has set out to end such criticism. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> announced plans last week for a new, 118-member Tactical Narcotics Team whose mission is to stamp out drug dealing in southeast <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. And an intense investigation has already led to the indictment of four men on charges of murdering the young cop. But skepticism runs high in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, where some residents are bitter that it took the murder of a police officer to bring attention to their plight. `` What about the kids being killed in the drug wars?'' asked a man who walked down a street a block from the murder site and refused to give his name. `` That's what people ought to be crying about. I know about 10 cases of young kids getting killed in the neighborhood, and nobody ever did anything about that.''

 With signs pointing to another <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary victory by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the vice president came under renewed criticism Sunday from GOP rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and from Democrats <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. Two polls published in Monday's editions of two newspapers gave contradictory indications of how the Democratic voters were expected to cast ballots in Tuesday's primary The poll in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moving into the lead, favored by 32 percent of the Democrats, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> by 29 percent and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 20 percent. Five hundred likely Democratic primary voters were contacted Thursday and Friday and the survey had a margin of error of 5 percent, meaning the numbers could be off that much up or down. However, a poll for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> holding a strong lead with 42 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 33 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 14 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> 4 percent, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> 3 percent and others and undecided, 4 percent. That poll was based on telephone interviews Friday night and Saturday with 287 Democratic voters who were likely to cast ballots. The margin of error was 6 percent. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, dependent on a home-state victory to remain in the race, said he had overcome poor showings in polls during other campaigns. `` If I get my message across to the people of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, they're going to vote for me,'' he said The new <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated slippage in <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support A survey published in the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday said the senator was leading with support from 35 percent of likely Democratic voters, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had the backing of 30 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that of 18 percent. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also traded barbs on the question of whether the Democratic nomination would be determined by a brokered convention next July in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll on Sunday also showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 34-point lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The newspaper did not continue surveying Republicans. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, struggling to revive his presidential campaign, insisted he would fight on `` full bore'' after <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> though he said he had no obligation `` to look ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who hopes to demonstrate some Northern support in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said he would `` almost certainly'' turn down his party's vice presidential nomination <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, at a campaign stop later, also blasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the Iran-Contra affair. `` The Reagan-Bush administration violated the law in a brazen way,'' he said, adding: `` We still do n't know what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role was. Interviewed on the CBS show, `` Face the Nation,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he received telegram from former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who urged him `` hang in there, do n't give up, make <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> your finest hour.'' `` I believe I have some obligation _ not to look ridiculous _ but some obligation to stay in this race,'' said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator. Asked if there was any chance he's drop out after <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` We're going full bore'' on the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, which holds its primary on April 5. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a Polish-language Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hyacinth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on the city's northwest side and described his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year and his meeting with Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` It is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that must keep alive the hope of the Polish people,'' the vice president told a crowd that filled the church and spilled onto the sidewalk outside. After church, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned a day of appearances at shopping malls and restaurants, each event described by his staff as a `` photo opportunity only.'' On the possibility of a brokered convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't imagine anything worse _ the idea of taking the right of the people to elect their president with their votes and putting it in some backrooms in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, predicting no Democrat would be able win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attitude demonstrated `` a touch of arrogance.'' He described the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as saying, `` You either vote for me or you'll have a brokered convention.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also came to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s defense and criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' commercial tries to lump him in with back-room politics of a kind <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has not been associated with.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, fresh from a victory in Democratic caucuses in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Saturday where he won 54 percent of the vote and picked up 23 delegates, said he hoped by the end of the primary and caucus season in June to have received `` a majority of the popular vote.'' Asked about the prospects of running against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Meet the Press,'' `` He certainly has a lot of baggage. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supposed to be over the commission on the drug situation, yet drugs are coming into this country at a rate that threatens our national security. ... To that continuous flow of drugs, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says no and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says nothing.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the Democratyic leader with 460 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> second with 423. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was third with 352. A total of 2,082 is needed for the nomination. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 705 and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 165, with 1,139 need for the nomination. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who received 18 percent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> vote and 6 delegates, said he consideed that `` a very good showing.'' `` I do n't know of anyone weho was surprised to see <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> win a big victory in his home state, his native state,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said on `` Face the Nation.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> denied he dislikes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but said, `` I do believe that he's sort of had a charmed life in politics, he's gotten quite a ways without doing very much Maybe that's a key to success I had n't thought of. The senator renewed his debate challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and raised again the question of a possible tie between the vice president and Panamanian strong man Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who has been accused of involvement in drug trafficking. `` I'd like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to tell us whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was on his payroll when he was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. As for his prospects for a comeback, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` Sooner or later, the voters in one of these states are going to say, wait a minute, we're about to nominate someone who ca n't win in November.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won easily Saturday in his native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Democratic precinct caucuses, giving his already surging campaign a boost just days before the primary in his adopted <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` Just because you're born in the slum does n't mean the slum's borne in you,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> `` I came home tonight to tell <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> there is a way out.'' With 93 percent of the state's 1,788 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 8,114 county convention delegates for 54 percent, followed by uncommitted with 2,853 delegates for 19 percent. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was in third place with 2,777 delegates for 18 percent. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailed far behind with 1,018 county convention delegates for 7 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> with 307 delegates for 2 percent and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with just 36 delegates.

I want to win another gold medal,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, noting his strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. `` I hope to walk away with the majority,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I should be the favorite son from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, congratulated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on his victory, saying `` I thought he would do very well there - it's his home state - and he did. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> called his candidate's performance `` a strong showing'' and added `` we expect to pick up a majority of the uncommitted.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials expected as many as 20,000 voters would participate in the caucuses in which 44 convention delegates were at stake. During a campaign swing across the state Friday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> predicted he would emerge as the leader in the muddled race for convention delegates once the votes are tallied in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which holds a primary on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> trails <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but leads <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the race for delegates to the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has waged an active campaign in the state and a newspaper survey of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairmen statewide found <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> expected to finish second to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have had a penchant for going to the caucuses and voting for uncommitted delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the top candidate four years ago but a plurality of the delegates remained uncommitted at the precinct level. This time around, campaign aides for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, were asking their supporters to remain uncommitted and work to become delegates at county conventions later in the month. But <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> urged supporters during a stop in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Friday to stand up for his candidacy and `` do n't let anyone talk you into being an uncommitted delegate.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides wanted voters to commit to him. The caucuses are the first stage of a three-stage process to select national convention delegates. Voters were to select delegates to the county conventions which in turn selects delegates to the state convention. The delegates are divided proportionally based on a candidates' showing But only those candidates with 15 percent of the vote at the state convention are entitled to national convention delegates. Delegates selected Saturday are bound to their candidates through the county and state conventions. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s assistant campaign coordinator, suggested neither <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would be able to round up the 15 percent of votes to allow them to receive any delegates. The campaigns would ask their people to stay uncommitted in the hopes something could be worked out at the county or state conventions to allow them to secure some delegates, he suggested. Although the caucuses have been overshadowed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Republican primary and the parade of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates it attracted, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> all stumped in the state during the past week <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had the endorsements of former Govs. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>. He promoted his trade policy this week at a campaign stop at a <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> textile plant that will be closed next month. But during the stop, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he hoped to get his campaign back on track by winning the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> primary March 26. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> both campaigned in the state earlier, neither has returned in recent weeks.

 A storm packing winds of up to 60 miles per hour capsized scores of small fishing boats, flattened hundreds of mud and straw huts and at least 15 people were feared dead, police said Sunday. Rescue workers searched the banks of the <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Sunday for survivors of the Friday storm in <LOCATION> Mankiganj </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, officials said. `` We see slim chances that the missing are still surviving,'' said a police official in <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, who spoke in a telephone interview on condition of anonymity. He said no bodies had yet been recovered. The storm along the river was slow in being reported because the wind also damaged electrical and telephone wires in the region. More than 300 mud and straw huts were flattened, and trees and crops damaged, officials said. More than 50 fishing boats were believed capsized or sunk.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Iranian Ground Offensive Repulsed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Sunday its warplanes attacked a supertanker off the Iranian coast, while its ground forces beat back an Iranian offensive in a pre-dawn battle in the central sector of the war front. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported more than 1,000 Iranians were killed in the 3 -LCB- - hour battle which began at 1 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> said two Iranian brigades, backed by tanks and artillery, were involved in the thrust `` Infantry units of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> repulsed the thrust, exterminating the bulk of the force. More than 1,000 Iranians were killed and the others were forced to retreat,'' the agency quoted an unnamed spokesman as saying. There was no immediate word from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on the reported battle. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not say where exactly the battle took place, but judging from the size of the force, the attack did not appear to signal the beginning of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s long-awaited major offensive. The large-scale attack is expected to be launched in the southern sector of the 730-mile front around <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and its only outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last thrust in January 1987, brought Iranian troops to within six miles of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. But Western military analysts say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has had difficulties mobilizing forces needed for a new attack. In a separate dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> INA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military spokesman as saying Iraqi planes `` dealt an accurate and effective blow to a very large maritime target,'' a reference to a supertanker, off the Iranian coast during the night. The report could not be immediately confirmed.

<HEAD>Challenger: Why U.S. Settled With Some Astronauts And Not Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> both were military officers. They trained together for two years to be astronauts. And they died together when the space shuttle Challenger blew up above the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. Though both were servicemen, the government contributed to a money award for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>'s relatives but went to court to avoid paying damages in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> were civilian <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion. The government contributed to a settlement with <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>'s dependents, but refused to contribute to settlements reached with the <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> and <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> families by rocket maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm hoping some of this inequity will lead to legislation to address the problems of the government's negligence,'' says lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s ex-husband. Why did the government settle with some astronaut families and not with others? One crucial difference: the families of <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> hired lawyers to negotiate for them. Their lawyers objected to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> positions in the case, and these three families are not likely to see any money from the government. The government did settle _ along with <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> _ with the four families who hired no lawyers: the Scobees, the Onizukas and the survivors of the two non-government crew members, teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>. These four spouses and six children shared in cash and annuities that cost $ 7,735,000. The government paid 40 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, 60 percent. They had relied on informal advice from the law partner of <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, and they talked only with the government, never directly with the company. Another difference is that once those four cases were settled Dec. 29, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers took an our-way-or-no-way approach to negotiating with the other families. The government sought to apply the same formula for financial benefits to each family. At the same time, it tried to negotiate a legal minefield bounded by two key <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. In one decision, the high court gave the government immunity from being sued for damages for its military and civilian employees who are killed on the job. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers did not want to see that doctrine weakened. In the other decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said a contractor who pays damages for the death of a federal worker can try to get some of that money back from the government, if federal employees shared in the blame. The government did not want to be dragged into court by <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> for a replay of the errors by government officials who spurned the protests of company engineers that it was too cold to launch Challenger. The two decisions left the government with direct liability for two Challenger astronauts and only indirect liability for the five federal workers aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s solution: settle only when the company also was a party. The split between the families had its roots in the government's financial benefit formula, based on the number and age of dependents and their needs and goals Justice spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said `` generous offers based on the same formula'' were made to all seven families. But the families with lawyers rejected them. The formula left out an element common to most court-awarded damages _ a calculation of lost wages. Legal experts say this benefited the <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> family, because the earning potential of public school teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> was dwarfed by that of her fellow crew members, who were engineers and physicists, all but one with advanced degrees. One lawyer involved in the negotiations said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> helped devise the formula and pressed other families to accept it because the government wanted a package settlement. A single settlement covering military, civilian federal and non-government crew members would ease the government's legal problem of having direct liability for some and indirect liability for others, this source said. But the benefit formula did not offer enough money to satisfy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>'s divorced father, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, and her niece and nephew. A 36-year-old, Ph.D. engineer, <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> was the only astronaut with neither spouse nor children. <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> said the formula only provided several hundred thousand dollars for the Resniks _ between a quarter and a half of what the government and company were offering the other families. After rejecting two government-company offers, <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. The company was agreeable to a joint government-company settlement with the Resniks for an amount roughly equal to that of <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON>. Hers was the lowest of the four settlements because the <ORGANIZATION> Jarvises </ORGANIZATION> had no children. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> would even make up the difference between this figure and the government-company offer that <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> had rejected. Checking with <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> and other relatives, <PERSON> Oldak </PERSON> found none who objected to bending the formula this much. But Justice officials heard differently. `` It's not accurate that it would not offend other families,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` One might have said OK. Two might have, but all of them would not subscribe to that Concern was voiced that an offer might not be in line with the formula used for the others, and we could n't do that.'' Last July, <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> wrote the government, `` I do n't believe that the department's position with respect to the <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> claim has been fair either to the <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> claimants or to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>.'' Ulimately, <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> settled alone with the Resniks; the astronaut's father said it came to $ 2 million to $ 3.5 million. <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> also settled with <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>'s widow and two infants. Their lawyer, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Krist </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, says he would not let the family accept a joint government-company offer as low that accepted by the other families. He offered to settle separately with the government for whatever it calculated its share was, and he would take on <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> independently. But the government refused. Justice's <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> explained, `` We could n't settle on behalf of the government alone, because there was no direct government liability. Our settlement offers were all on behalf of both the government and the company.'' But the joint settlements left the question of liability too murky for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>. `` She did n't feel justice was being served,'' her lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> said. `` She feels now that the people whose negligence caused the accident should be accountable for their actions.'' She sued <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, the government and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer responsible for the booster rocket that was blamed for the accident. But last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> expanded its 35-year-old doctrine that military survivors may not sue the government. It extended the government's immunity to a case like the Challenger disaster, where a military pilot was killed while supervised by federal civilian employees. Government lawyers appeared in court and got both the government and <PERSON> Mulloy </PERSON> dismissed as defendants. <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> has filed notice he intends to appeal. `` That ruling says, in effect, that a military person is a second class citizen, that no matter how negligent our government was in this situation that the people in the agencies involved are n't accountable,'' <PERSON> Maready </PERSON> said. `` It's a dangerous thing for the space program to be run by people who are n't fully accountable.''

<HEAD>Despite Summit Agreement, Requests Mounting for More 1988 Federal
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The highly touted budget summit agreement, long since enacted into law, definitively settled the question of how much money the federal government should spend this year. Right? Wrong. Congressional leaders are girding for a fight over whether spending in fiscal year 1988, which is nearly half over, needs to be increased. Whether lawmakers adhere to the summit pact and only provide extra money for what the agreement called `` dire emergencies'' rests on whether they succumb to the urge to spend more _ an urging fueled by the fact that this is an election year. In an era of $ 1 trillion federal budgets, requests for an additional several billion dollars for unforeseen needs are made by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> virtually every year. They are called supplemental spending bills. But the budget pact concluded by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders forbade supplementals `` except in the case of dire emergency.'' The term was left undefined. Lawmakers are already beginning to submit new spending proposals said to be for dire emergencies. One, with 37 co-sponsors, would provide $ 105 million to the financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Another, with 20 co-sponsors, would add $ 263 million in spending for the homeless. `` My experience around here is it's sort of like a pent-up lake and the dam could break very easily,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and one of the negotiators at last fall's budget summit, says of the congressional proclivity for spending money. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said last week that he interprets dire emergencies to include crises such as natural disasters or military operations. `` Aside from that kind of thing, it's not our expectation, nor our intention'' to approve other kinds of new spending, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Indeed, many lawmakers seem to believe that in this election year it could be bad politics to openly preach more spending because of the effect on the deficit. There is another reason for Democrats to be leery of a supplemental spending bill. Many of them believe it could become a way for aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to be restored. `` The administration will ultimately use the supplemental for Contra aid,'' predicts Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif. Despite those incentives, some are pessimistic that lawmakers seeking new spending will be thwarted. `` They'll be caving, and it's unfortunate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and another summit participant. `` It seems like per usual, everybody's got their program they're particularly interested in that's just not getting enough money. Lawmakers will be watching closely this week, when the administration says it will submit a supplemental spending bill of its own. The package is expected by congressional aides to be worth between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion, but administration officials say it will produce no red ink. Instead, they say the spending for veterans, black lung benefits, the judicial branch, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, prisons and other programs will be offset by cuts in other unspecified areas. If legislators believe that some of the spending in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request is not truly for emergencies, some lawmakers might be encouraged to press for money for programs they favor Under any circumstances, some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might try to attach their requests for new spending to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal. Such requests, once submitted, might be hard for other lawmakers to resist, especially with elections coming in a few months. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION>, because it is low on money, has already announced plans to curtail more than half of its drug enforcement patrols and to close several facilities. Members could be hard-pressed to vote against restoring such cuts. Even if such efforts lose, lawmakers lose nothing by introducing them and showing their constituents that at least they tried. `` This is how they start brewing the stew,'' said one congressional aide, who asked not to be identified, about how extra spending gets generated.

<HEAD>Company Says Alarms Faulty On Some Machines Monitoring Babies'
Breathing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As many as 5,000 machines designed to monitor babies at risk of sudden infant death syndrome have faulty alarms that could leave infants vulnerable to death or injury, warns the company that makes them. The devices, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Aequitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are designed to sound an alarm if an infant suddenly stops breathing or has an abnormal heart rate. But the machines have a `` higher than acceptable failure rate,'' the company's president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said last week. The company issued a safety alert, warning dealers about the defect in its new model, No. 9200, which has been shipped to homes and hospitals nationwide since last July. The alert does not affect about 40,000 earlier models. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that no injuries or deaths have been reported, but that the company learned within the last two or three weeks that the alarm had failed in some instances. The device primarily is used in homes to monitor children believed to be at high risk for SIDS. The mysterious malady is the seventh leading killer of younger Americans, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. In some cases, the infants suffer from apnea, a tendency to stop breathing while asleep, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. If the alarm sounds in time, an adult often can awaken the child and restart his or her breathing. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the company is notifying its dealers about the problem by registered letter. The dealers will alert individual customers, who lease the machines for home use.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Drop Fraud Count Due To Defendant's Memory Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal prosecutors say they have dropped a fraud count against a former insurance agent who lost all memory of his alleged crime after suffering a heart attack. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 52, had been charged with pocketing $ 76,386 by filing a false insurance policy claim. Federal prosecutors dismissed the charge Friday, basing their decision on medical opinion that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is unable to proceed in court. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> filled out a bogus life insurance form on Dec. 14, 1983, backdated it and invented a fake beneficiary to receive the money from his former employer, <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> scanned newspapers for stories on violent or accidental deaths and used those victims' names in the fraudulent policies She said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had used the scheme more than once but said prosecutors agreed to press only one count in exchange for a guilty plea. But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' deteriorating health prevented him from ever making a plea, <PERSON> Ranson </PERSON> said. `` We thought ... that he was playing games, and that's why we held off for a long time,'' <PERSON> Ranson </PERSON> said. `` But he really is in bad shape.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was disabled since November 1986, when he suffered a cardiac arrest that included `` one episode of sudden death,'' according to Dr. M.I. <PERSON> Dababnah </PERSON>. The seizure came three months after <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was charged. It apparently caused him to lose his memory, <PERSON> Dababnah </PERSON> said in reports to federal court. That diagnosis was supported by Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a clinical psychologist for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Determination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has virtually no memory for significant events within the last five years,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> advised the court.

<TEXT>
 A man who said his hearing was damaged when a <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> airline attendant spilled hot drinks over his head has won nearly $ 40,000 in damages, a newspaper reported Sunday. The plaintiff, a <LOCATION> Bahraini </LOCATION> lawyer identified as <PERSON> Abdul-Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmas </PERSON>, had filed the suit against the West German airline in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s High Civil Court. The lawsuit alleged negligence and said the flight attendant accidentally spilled four pots of hot coffee and tea over his head, according to the English-language Gulf Daily News. The newspaper said the court awarded him 15,000 dinars, or $ 39,750, which was one-tenth the amount sought. The paper said the accident occurred during a flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, when the plane hit severe turbulence. It gave no precise dates. The man's injuries led to three months' treatment in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The court ruled that it was the airline's responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers, the paper said. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> have refused to comment on the case.

 President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s party increased its already wide margin in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by picking up two more seats in weekend repolling, the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday Voting was held Saturday in nine districts where violence during the main election March 3 had forced it to be called off. At least 13 people were killed and 300 others injured in clashes March 3, and two more people died in bomb blasts in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> during repolling Saturday, police said. The country's major opposition parties, which have been waging a campaign since November to oust <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, boycotted the Parliament balloting. They contend that fair elections can not be held until <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> resigns and have denounced the latest vote as fraudulent. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 249 seats in the 330-member house, according to the latest results. The <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of scores of small groups, won 18 seats. Two minor parties won two seats each, and independents won 25 seats. The results in three districts have not yet been announced. In one district, where a candidate was killed, voting has been scheduled for April 7. Another 30 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are reserved for women, who are chosen later. The major opposition parties contend that less than 1 percent of the nation's 48 million registered voters cast ballots in the Parliament elections. But government officials say the turnout appeared to be more than 50 percent. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> scheduled the elections after dissolving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> 3 -LCB- years before its five-year term was set to expire in an effort to appease his foes. The former army general took power in a 1982 bloodless coup and was elected president in a 1986 election. Major opposition parties contended that vote was fraudulent.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a brash self-styled reformer who unseated a political legend to take office Monday as governor, says he faces `` a difficult and interesting job'' in trying to solve <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s problems. `` I think I'm just a representative of the people in this. I think it's a make-or-break situation for the kinds of things we want,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, 44, said in a recent interview. As Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> leaves office, the state faces the immediate problems of a four-year, $ 1.2 billion budget deficit and a cash shortage that threatens to shut down state government. Fiscal analysts have warned that the state faces as much as a $ 1 billion shortfall for the 1988-89 fiscal year. The state's unemployment rate hit 12 percent in January, one of the highest in the nation, due primarily to the long-running downturn in the oil and gas industry. At the same time, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s education systems are under challenge as second-rate, business interests are demanding a major overhaul of the state's tax system in order to attract new industry, and environmental groups are calling for tougher regulations to protect the air and water. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who plans major reforms in those areas and others such as in campaign finance practices, said the challenge is unlike that facing any other <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> governor. `` We need a combination in the next four years of a crisis manager and a long-term planner,'' he said. `` It's rare that you combine the two. That's what I'm going to have to do as governor. `` But I've got to do both to get us out of debt and build _ education development, economic development, better environment. It's going to be a difficult and interesting job.'' To get started, the Democratic former congressman is planning a low-budget inauguration minus the traditional parade and inaugural night ball. According to his transition office, only $ 48,000 will be spent on the entire event, less than the $ 60,000 Gov. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> spent on the stage used for his swearing-in ceremony in 1980. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who campaigned on the need for a `` revolution'' to turn around the state's declining fortunes, said the first year of his administration will be dedicated to reversing the financial problems and creating a new image for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, often associated with scandal. `` Confidence, attitude and legislative programs _ and then we will slowly fund them over the next four years,'' he said. `` This plan wo n't be magic, it wo n't be instant. We've had to build from the ground up. But I'm very pleased with the progress we've made.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last administration defending himself successfully against federal racketeering charges. As solutions for the state's budget problems, he proposed a statewide lottery and casino gambling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is opposed to both. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he was happy that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was willing to help during the transition between the Oct. 24 election and Monday's inauguration At <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s request <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> department store executive, as commissioner of administration. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> also approved about $ 36 million in budget cuts requested by <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, but shielded the giant <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> from the fiscal ax. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is considering splitting the agency into two departments as part of a reorganization program to be studied by a special legislative session later this month. Short-term budget reductions also will be on the agenda. <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> has spearheaded efforts to minimize the cash-flow problem by pushing back more than $ 480 million in expenditures until the new fiscal year begins July 1. The cash-saving measures include delaying payments to government retirement systems, holding state income tax refund checks for 90 days and pushing one state payday back. In the meantime, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he will cut the budget back as far as he can before the subject of taxes is broached. `` We are not going to raise taxes or change taxes until we cut this budget,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. `` It is out of control.''

<TEXT>
 A top Taiwanese nuclear scientist has disappeared and may have fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with confidential blueprints disclosing that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> plans to make nuclear weapons, newspapers reported Sunday. Government officials repeatedly have denied any plans to produce nuclear weapons and said all nuclear research programs in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are for peaceful purposes. On Friday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei-yuan </PERSON> told the lawmaking <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION> that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-yi </PERSON>, 45, who was deputy director of the nuclear energy research center at the military-run <ORGANIZATION> Chungshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said the warrant was issued because <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> had not asked permission for leave. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> has been missing since January, and officials said they have no information on his whereabouts. But the mass circulation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s daughter, Pei-fen, wrote from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to a classmate at an elementary school in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> last month saying she missed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> The letter gave no return address and the girl gave no indication whether she was living with her father, the newspaper said. Without disclosing the source of their information, several newspapers claimed that <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy and had fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> together with his wife and three children. The liberal newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an unidentified institute official, said <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> earlier had collected `` a whole bunch'' of pictures and confidential information on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s nuclear plans.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will spend five days in this communist country studying economic and social problems that he hopes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can avoid as it embraces reform. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which has jealously guarded its independence from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power for 40 years, presents a picture of prosperity to a visitor from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A crush of private automobiles in the capital and store windows displaying local and Western-made consumer goods of every description make <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s truck-cluttered streets and drab facades seem all the more barren. But the country's system of `` self-managed, market socialism'' is struggling with high inflation, high unemployment, widespread labor unrest and a paralyzing $ 20 billion debt to Western creditors. And <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s leadership must constantly perform a delicate balancing act to prevent the country from being torn apart by nationalistic rivalries within its borders. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrives here Monday for a five-day visit that includes <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the northern industrial city of <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> and the southern resort city of <LOCATION> Dubrovnik </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader, who has just marked the end of his third year in power, is trying to boost the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> out of economic stagnation. He has decentralized control over production and introduced market forces to shake workers and managers out of their notorious complacency. During his tour <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may gain some pointers on his programs of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring of the Soviet economy, and `` glasnost,'' which encourages more open expression of ideas for solving the nation's problems. With the development in recent years of a free-wheeling press and a mixed economy that encourages both private enterprise and central planning, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> offers something of a window on the future for the reform-minded Soviet leader. Runaway inflation and the government's powerless decrees aimed at curing the country's economic ills serve notice that the path may not be an easy one. In recent months, as ethnic minorities have attempted to take advantage of the Soviet government's new tolerance to express their long-held grievances, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has faced challenges from nationalists of several stripes. Despite some rioting and huge mass demonstrations in the southern republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaidjian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, no Soviet ethnic group has the strength that <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> nationalities have used to guarantee each a share of governing power at the expense of the central authorities. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the first Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since the death of <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> in May 1980. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> broke with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1948 and steered a stubbornly independent course outside the Soviet bloc. After being forced by a Soviet-led blockade to open trade with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has since re-established economic ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today is <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner, with the Yugoslavs importing primarily crude oil and other raw materials and exporting manufactured goods, including much-prized shoes, clothing and technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A $ 1.4 billion trade surplus is a subject of concern in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, but there has been speculation the Soviets may agree to pay off their paper debt by building a subway system for the traffic-clogged Yugoslav capital. The present <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leadership, headed by an eight-member state presidency, has continued <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s independent political course, and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> remains an important nation in the non-aligned movement. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to formally acknowledge that special status with the issuance during his visit of a joint declaration guaranteeing full Yugoslavian independence. But in the context of his public statements in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and to fellow <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year, the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declaration may signal more independence for other East European nations as well. The Soviet leader has said his nation has no monopoly on the proper path to socialism, and reform-minded leaders elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected to test his words with experiments aimed at reinvigorating their own economies. Yugoslav deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Ilija </PERSON> <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON>, has said the new Soviet-Yugoslav document would update previous declarations signed by the two countries in 1955 and 1956 and will `` further confirm principles of non-interference on the basis of equality and soveregnty.''

<HEAD>Soviet Deadline Near On Afghan Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Talks aimed at ending the Afghan war are one day away from a Soviet deadline for their completion, but a crucial dispute on who will run the country still stands in the way of a signed settlement. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last month that Soviet troops would begin withdrawing troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by mid-May if an agreement is reached by March 15. But sources close to the U.N.-sponsored negotiations say they do n't view the deadline as rigid. Delegations from the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which is representing the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance, both say they are ready to extend the negotiations. U.N. Undersecretary General <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, the talks' mediator, said he asked both sides to seek `` strengthened instructions'' during the weekend to prepare for Monday's session. Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979. An estimated 115,000 troops have been helping the government fight the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. The latest round, the longest since the talks began in 1982, opened with a confident mood on March 2. Two days later, an accord was announced on an issue that had stalled negotiations for years, with both sides agreeing on a timetable and the basic logistics for withdrawing the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops. Under that accord, the pullout would be completed within nine months after its start, with half of the troops leaving in the first three months. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said later there remained no `` differences of substance'' that would bar tying up a peace package of agreements. The agreements include a bilateral agreement pledging the two countries to not interfere in each other's affairs and arrangements for the return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But the quick pace of the early talks quickly ran into snags. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief representative, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, said the talks were `` inching slowly'' forward, but that he expected them to regain speed this week. He did not elaborate why. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> allies, represented at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, blame <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for holding up final agreement. They fault <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s insistence on linking the proposed settlement to the formation of a transitional government acceptable to the resistance. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said that the makeup of the future government should be decided by the Afghans themselves. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is insisting on a transitional government that would allow for the safe return of anti-Soviet refugees. So far, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> has given no indication that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would drop its demand. But sources close to the talks said <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> still hopes to strike a deal with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, perhaps on the timing of the establishment of a new government. But another issue had cast an increasingly larger shadow on the talks: superpower aid to the two opposing sides. On March 4, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demanded that all foreign military aid to the warring parties must stop simultaneously. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has flatly rejected the demand, saying the accords will leave it free to continue military aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the troop withdrawal. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said the draft agreements provide only for a cessation of military aid to the U.S.-backed guerrillas. In a strong statement on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Afghan rebels will not be halted until the Soviets stopped their assistance to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The Soviets sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to prop up the wobbly Marxist government. The guerrillas, meanwhile, have formed their own government and have rejected any power sharing with the Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> ISLAMABAD </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> -LRB- ap -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s tough stand at the slow-moving Afghan peace talks has touched off a power struggle among guerrilla leaders fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> has been barnstorming the country to drum up support for his demand that an accord on a Soviet troop withdrawal be coupled with a plan for a future <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. In the meantime, the fractious guerrilla alliance, whose factions all want a voice in that new government, has been plagued by upheaval. During the weekend, <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> resigned as chairman of the seven-party alliance, ostensibly for health reasons. But there were numerous reports, unconfirmed by guerrilla spokesmen, that the 69-year-old <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> quit to protest plans to send a resistance delegation to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, which resume Monday. Another insurgent leader, <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON>, pulled his moderate <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> out of the alliance complaining of undue pressure from the body's four-party majority of Moslem extremists. Two days later, <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> returned to the fold, saying he had received `` certain assurances'' from the fundamentalists and from Pakistani officials. He did not elaborate. There has been intense Pakistani pressure on the guerrillas to come up with an acceptable plan for forming a transitional government that would preside over the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops who back <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist rulers. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which for years insisted the Soviet presence was the root of the Afghan conflict, reversed itself this year by declaring it would not sign an agreement that does not address <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s political future <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> speaks for the guerrillas at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks and cares for about 3.5 million Afghan refugees living in camps near the Afghan border. It also channels <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to the guerrillas, who are headquartered in the northwest Pakistani city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have accused <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> of blocking what could be an imminent Soviet pullout, <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s public relations campaign indicates <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s stand has solid public support. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said his troops could begin going home on May 15 if <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> sign an agreement by March 15. The deadline pressure has taken its toll on the guerrilla alliance. While rejecting the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks because of the guerrillas' exclusion, the alliance nevertheless responded with a proposal for a heavily Moslem government headed by alliance leaders. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> protested when the extremists used their majority to vote in one of their own as future president, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ittehad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The moderate factions favor a compromise government that could include some communists now in power in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, possibly headed by former King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mojaddedi </PERSON> insisted that the 73-year-old monarch, currently in exile in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, is the only neutral figure acceptable to a majority of Afghans. <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION>'s resignation, meanwhile, threatened to widen the split because the next leader in line for the rotating chairmanship is <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the Hezb-i-Islami and the most extremist Moslem guerrilla of all. While fending off acusations that his fighters have attacked rival groups inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> recently had taken to upstaging <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> by calling press conferences of his own to promote <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>'s hardline vision of a fundamentalist Islamic regime. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Uaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharafat </PERSON>, press spokesman for the alliance, said there were plans to send a guerrilla delegation to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks to help clear up the confusion over the insurgents' stand. Even that move threatened to cause a rift. <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, leader of the Ittehad party, issued a statement Sunday declaring his opposition to sending a delegation. `` And under no circumstances shall we agree to any kind of direct or indirect talks with the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime or the -LRB- ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' he said. Pakistani officials publicly have urged the guerrillas to soften their stand in the interest of peace. But so far, the extremists among the insurgents have equated compromise with capitulation.

A dispute over control of a region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, where more than three quarters of the population is Armenian, triggered mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in recent weeks and rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> that killed at least 32. <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, who was released from a labor camp a year ago following a government review of political sentencings, said the seminar adopted three resolutions that will be forwarded to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on how to resolve ethnic problems. The first demands broad public discussion of ethnic tensions to correct widespread ignorance of the causes of nationalistic outbursts. Another calls for discussion of limitations on religious freedom and the government's propagation of atheism, which the activists said is the root of some ethnic turmoil. The third proposal calls on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government to let Crimean Tatars return to their historic homeland, the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> peninsula from which they were routed during World War II when dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> accused the entire population of collaborating with Nazi invaders. The Tatars were exonerated two decades later, but they have been banned from returning to the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION>, now the site of some of the best resorts and official retreats. He said the documents produced at the seminar would be circulated among activists so the `` unofficial viewpoint'' on nationalities questions can reach the Soviet public.

 The floods of vacationing students that once deluged this seaside community each spring have gone, leaving some hoteliers broken and the city rethinking its economy. Only 100,000 college students are expected to bask this year on the subtropical sands, made famous in the 1960 movie `` Where the Boys Are.'' There were 350,000 in 1985. The loss of business has prompted 12 smaller hotels that depended on the student crush to auction off their properties together April 7, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMastry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Having paid top dollar for hotels in the early 1980 boom years, many of them now can not meet their mortgage payments. By selling en masse, they hope to gain high prices by offering developers the opportunity to assemble large tracts. The unmanageable hordes of sunworshipping students, who packed hotel rooms by night and patronized businesses on the beach strip by day, divided this resort town. Beach-front nightspots, vendors and student-dependent hotels clamored for continued promotion of spring break. But their cries were overcome by the din of residents and year-round businesses, snarled in springtime traffic and furious about paying for police and cleaning up mountains of trash. Since 1986, when city leaders used strict law enforcement to quell the riotous partying, the city and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have been trying to diversify their tourist clientele. Last year, word of strict police enforcement of parking, drinking, and code regulations discouraged student visitors, costing merchants $ 40 million and 100,000 student customers. The <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the 200,000 student visitors spent about $ 80 million, one-third less than the $ 120 million tally from 1986, in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> area. Police made about 1,300 arrests during last year's spring break, with college students comprising about one-third of them. There were 2,506 arrests in 1986. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> is experiencing a `` shaking out,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Handevidt </PERSON>, who plans to sell his <ORGANIZATION> Orton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> at the auction. `` What's happened is the city has said, ` Whoa! We ca n't deal with this,''' <PERSON> Handevidt </PERSON> said of spring break. `` It was bad in 1985. I do n't know anyone who would say differently.'' The atmosphere of drunkenness, littered streets and the stench from people urinating in the streets drove people away, he said. `` The money's just not coming in, so people are selling out,'' said the manager of a small hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We're losing money every week.'' <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> can not depend on a seasonal tourism, officials said. The beach businesses are beginning to understand that, said <PERSON> Nickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioner and chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want every tourist'' _ from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> fans during baseball's spring training to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION> fans and the teams the <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION> play at nearby <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, she said. But spring break is not dead in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. Many students still come to this palm-dotted shore, warmed beneath 80-degree skies and bathed by 78-degree surf. `` We have a tradition at ` Lyco' that for the last three years we've won first place at the Button -LRB- nightclub -RRB- drinking, wet T-shirt and guys' bikini contests. And we kept that tradition alive today,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, one of 15 Sigma Pi fraternity brothers visiting from <ORGANIZATION> Lycoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Only one `` small'' incident interfered with the fraternity vacation, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said `` We've got another buddy I tried unsuccessfully to bail out of jail today _ and get this _ the charge was throwing dangerous missiles, trespassing and disorderly conduct for picking up a table with cups on it and throwing it over a balcony.''

<HEAD>British Producer Lines Up Witnesses Against Waldheim For TV Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British producer says he has lined up 70 witnesses, including some who served with <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in World War II, to give evidence at a televised `` trial'' of allegations the Austrian president was involved in Nazi atrocities. The list includes some of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s subordinates and superiors when he was an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from 1939 to 1945, says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON>, who is producing the show for broadcast on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and overseas television in June. `` It took a lot of persuasion to get some of them to do it,'' <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> said in a recent interview. With cameras rolling, lawyers will spend nine days beginning April 13 examining witnesses as if they were in a court of law, before a panel of retired jurists, including <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufstedler </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> education secretary and federal <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. The program then will be edited down to four hours, ending with the judges' decision on whether there is probable cause that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> acted contrary to the international laws of war. `` Nobody has any idea how it will come out,'' <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> says. `` There's astonishingly little control over it. That's the beauty of it.'' The show is the latest entrant in what <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> himself has called a new `` cottage industry'' _ investigating whether the Austrian president knew about, supported or took part in atrocities when he served the Germans in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> during the war. Since the investigations began with a probe by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has been denounced around the world, been placed on a list of undesirables banned from entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has become the focus of a bitter debate in his homeland. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied taking part in atrocities. Indeed, <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> says that in preparing for the show, he talked to the Austrian leader for nearly an hour to get <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s side of the story. What did <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> think of being `` tried'' on television? `` He was not overjoyed,'' <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think I'll be getting a Christmas card this year from <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.'' Nor will <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> appear on the program. Work for the show began in May 1987, when producers at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> decided to do to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> what was done several years ago on a program called `` The Trial of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'' That was a mock courtroom proceeding, using real attorneys, judges and witnesses to the shooting of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1963 to determine if <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was guilty of the crime For aesthetic and legal reasons and because the participating witnesses and lawyers would have objected, <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> and his colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and co-producing Home Box Office cringe when anyone uses the word `` trial'' when describing what they are doing to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. They want to avoid comparisons with the daily syndicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> show, `` People's Court,'' where a real judge settles such issues as `` The Case of the Busted Headlight.'' The show will be a `` commission of inquiry,'' with retired jurists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> hearing testimony elicited by a `` presenting counselor,'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Nazi-hunting wing. Lord <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s attorney general from 1970 to 1974, will be the `` challenging counsel,'' trying to rebut the evidence against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. The proceedings will be filmed in a courtroom built for the program. Then the judges will deliberate privately for as long as they think necessary and then deliver their opinions to the cameras a few days before the show goes on the air. Like the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, they may not agree. And like the high court, no one _ not even the producers _ will be allowed to hear the deliberations. The rules of evidence will be similar to those used in grand jury proceedings and the judgment will not be whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> is guilty, but whether there is enough evidence to bring an indictment. `` This is about as close as anyone is going to get to bringing the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> case into a court of law,'' <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> said. `` No matter what we call it, the audience is going to say ` this is the trial of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>' and they're going to sit at home, and decide if he's a fascist,'' the producer said. According to evidence already made public, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was a German intelligence officer familiar with reprisals against civilians to stop guerrilla activities in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Questions have also been raised about whether he was involved in deportation of Greek Jews to death camps and mistreatment of Allied prisoners of war. The controversy has been heightened by the fact that for many years, notably during his years of service as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> omitted all mention of his service in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in his official biography. <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> said a team of investigators hired by the producers scoured archives and searched for witnesses in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. So far, stations in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and Australian have said they will show the program. Negotiations with a West German station are underway. Austrian television has also been offered a chance to buy the program, but there's no sign it will do so, <PERSON> Saltman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers hoping to make <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> the first state to ban the sale of realistic-looking toy guns are stockpiling ammunition to fight opponents, including toy makers and retailers lobbying against the bill. Merchant groups are pushing to have any law take effect in 1991 so they can unload their plastic armories over three Christmas seasons, instead of two. Toy makers argue that any legislative remedies should come from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, not the states, so manufacturers do n't have to make 50 different types of toy machine guns to fit the requirements of each state. `` I think it would be a mass of total confusion if you regulate an interstate industry in a non-uniform manner,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Locker </PERSON>, general counsel for the Toy Manufacturers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Against that backdrop, <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Malhalab </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must deal with the problem soon. `` I urge you to lead the nation. Do n't wait for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Malalab </PERSON> said. `` By the time you come up with something, more children are going to be killed.'' <PERSON> Malhalab </PERSON> brought a cache of the look-alike weapons to show the committee just how realistic the toys can look. He asked for laws requiring markings on the toys to make it easier for police officers to make split-second decisions. `` Make it a different color. Make it red. Make it blue. Make it yellow,'' <PERSON> Malhalab </PERSON> said. The renewed call for a ban on the look-alike toys was sparked by the Feb. 19 shooting death of a 13-year-old retarded boy in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He was gunned down by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police officers who mistook his plastic pistol for the real thing. A week later, 57 <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members co-sponsored a bill requiring the barrel of any toy firearm to be permanently sealed and colored in an `` indelible fluorescent orange.'' But legislators also were considering if the ban were in place how they would prevent criminals from copying the markings on fake guns and possibly tricking police into letting down their guard. Rep. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walberg </PERSON> said he's afraid officers might see a potential cop-killer with a colored gun and develop a false sense of security. `` -LRB- Criminals -RRB- are creative people. I see no problem with them taking a live weapon and painting it orange,'' <PERSON> Walberg </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, became the first city in the nation to ban the sale of any toy that resembles a real weapon last September.

 Two avalanches Sunday crushed houses in this mountanous region under a mass of snow, killing seven people and injuring about 20, authorities said. No Americans were among the dead. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, meanwhile, an Italian skier was killed when he was buried by an avalanche on ski slopes near the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> border, authorities reported. The snowslides in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> followed three avalanches in the same region Saturday that killed three people. Sunday's avalanches roared down Mt. Zwoelferkopf shortly after dawn, engulfing a gas station and several houses before they blocked a nearby railroad track, minutes after a train had passed the area. The avalanches occurred in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, a well-known skiing area that has traditionally attracts Scandinavian and British tourists. The massive snowslides ripped off roofs and crushed or tore off walls of houses, some of which have stood there for 300-400 years, a policeman said. Authorities said five Swedish tourists and two Austrians were killed and about 20 others were injured. The identities of victims and the injured were not released. In <LOCATION> Innsbruck </LOCATION>, the provincial security police headquarters put the fatality figure in this weekend's avalanches in the <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> at 10, saying no more people were believed hidden under the rubble and snow at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION>. Some of the Swedes were said to have been buried by collapsing walls of a boarding house, one of several buildings seriously damaged by the snow. Policemen said the two avalanches had a combined length of about 1,200 feet and a height of up to 33 feet. In <LOCATION> Sondrio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a rescue dog located the body of <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rini </PERSON>, 37, after his wife came down the mountain to report the avalanche, the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Saturday, <PERSON> Per-Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundborg </PERSON>, a 24-year-old Swedish tourist from <LOCATION> Hoerby </LOCATION>, was killed, also near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION>. He was part of a group of five Swedish skiers who triggered an avalanche in an area barred from skiers. Also on Saturday, 17-year-old <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Groenebach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was buried and killed by masses of snow when an avalanche hit seven people near a ski lift in the town of <LOCATION> Biberwier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> province. Two strollers were hit by a 1,500-foot-wide avalanche at <LOCATION> Berwang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> province, Saturday. <PERSON> Eckehard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leupold </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was rescued from the masses of snow, but his wife, <PERSON> Erika </PERSON>, died. In <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> and westernmost <LOCATION> Vorarlberg </LOCATION> province, up to 45,000 tourists, many of them foreigners, were stranded Sunday after heavy weekend snowfalls and a series of avalanches blocked many roads in the region. <LOCATION> Vorarlberg </LOCATION> was completely cut off from the outside after an avalanche disrupted rail traffic on Saturday, and the only exit out of <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> province was the <LOCATION> Kufstein </LOCATION> checkpoint on the border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Motoring clubs said the line of cars traveling northward reached more than 15 miles in length. Traffic conditions were chaotic in most parts of western <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, including the province of <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> where many roads had to be closed after half a dozen snowslides.

 Actress <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> says she and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> wept after deciding to abort a child they conceived out of wedlock and she continued to weep about the decision for another three decades. `` For over 30 years, alone, in the night, I cried,'' she writes in her autobiography, `` <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>: As I Am,'' excepts of which were published in the April issue of Good Housekeeping. `` If I had only one thing to do over in my life, I would have that baby,'' Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> says. She and <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> were attracted to each other during filming of the movie, `` The Fountainhead,'' according to the 62-year-old actress, who was 24 at the time. After filming ended, their love affair began, she said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was living with his wife and daughter at the time. `` Sharing a life with <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> was not complex,'' Miss <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> wrote. `` I knew I had no rights with him. I did not allow myself then to consider the possibility of a permanent relationship. We were not building a future together. We were seizing moments.''

<HEAD>Soviet Paper Hints Police Erred In Ending Hijack</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> MOSCOW </LOCATION> _ A newspaper Sunday questioned whether officials acted properly by ordering a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet to land on Soviet territory, pointing out that nine people were killed, 19 injured and the plane burned to ashes. An 11-member family jazz band from the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> seized the plane on Tuesday as it headed across the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, Soviet reports said. They demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Aeroflot crew duped the air pirates into believing they were landing in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, but set down at a small airstrip near <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The hijackers, led by a matriarch in her 50s who had been honored as a Hero-Mother of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, shot and killed a stewardess when they realized they had been deceived and set off a bomb after two hours of negotiations when a police assault team stormed the plane. Five of the hijackers were killed, Soviet reports said. Sunday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth newspaper, said the hijackers would have faced trial in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> if their demands to be flown there had been granted. `` We are entitled to a question: was n't the price too costly for the decision to detain the bandits on our territory?'' the newspaper asked. `` An answer to this question lies with the courts.'' In calculating the cost of the incident, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said `` the aircraft burned to ashes, nine people, including five of the criminals, were killed, and 19 people, including two on the assault team, were wounded, and many will be crippled for life.'' Previous reports said the hijackers detonated a bomb in the tail section, setting fire to the plane, but the extent of the damage had not been made clear. The report said the police assault team had plenty of time to prepare before the Tupolev-154 landed, but it implied that the preparations were inadequate. Among the 76 passengers on board, three were killed and 32 surgical operations were needed among the 19 wounded, the newspaper said. It said one passenger's face was smashed with the butt of a submachine gun in the melee that ensued on the ground when people began jumping from doors and windows to flee the fire. A criminal investigating team has been assigned to the case, and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency has reported that the surviving hijackers are in custody.

<HEAD>Aspin Blames Air Force For MX Problems, Service Defends It's
Accuracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is `` part of the problem'' in the guidance system for the MX missile, but the service says once again the weapon is reliable and accurate. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his panel's investigation of the 10-warhead weapon shows there are still problems in producing the missile's inertial measurement unit -LRB- IMU -RRB-, or guidance system. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s latest criticism of the MX was contained in a speech he plans to deliver on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor Monday. A text of the speech was released Sunday. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> has previously criticized <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, which is building the IMUs at a <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plant. `` Documents recently received by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> show that while <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is undeniably having its difficulties, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is part of the problem,'' according to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s speech. He said the documents, obtained from persons whom he did not identify, show that the service considered accepting one <ORGANIZATION> IMU </ORGANIZATION> without inspecting it, and also protested the use of a process exempting small components from testing. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Capt. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Defrank </PERSON>, said, `` we stand by the <ORGANIZATION> IMU </ORGANIZATION>'s reliability and accuracy. We've answered many of the charges in his statement. There is nothing new there.'' The MX is the centerpiece of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nuclear build-up. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> originally wanted to build 100 of the missiles and put them in silos in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> limited the total deployment to 50 because of fears about the weapon's vulnerability to a Soviet strike The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> now wants to build 50 more and put them aboard trains. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has said he would like to put all 100 of the weapons aboard trains. The MX weapons tested thus far have shown better-than-expected accuracy, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has consistently defended the ability of the weapons deployed to hit their targets. Thus far, 34 MX weapons have been deployed, but only 22 have the proper IMUs. The other dozen still lack guidance systems, <PERSON> Defrank </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> has promised to accelerate production of the guidance systems, and all 50 of the MX weapons are scheduled to be deployed by the end of 1988. One of the IMUs cited by <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> failed after only 200 hours on alert atop an MX missile, according to his speech. That would mean that it fell far short of the service standard of 3,000 hours allowed between failures, he said. But <PERSON> Defrank </PERSON> said the 3,000 hours is a standard mean time, meaning it is an average. `` To criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for one <ORGANIZATION> IMU </ORGANIZATION> failing is meaningless because it's the mean time between failures that is important, and we're meeting that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Book Discloses Pentagon Bug, Other Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> planted listening devices in an apartment of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> several years ago, but the bugs failed to pick up any meaningful data, according to book excerpts published Sunday. The Noriega bugging story is one detail in a widespread secret effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> that included efforts to rescue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages, aid the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and collect information on potential enemies around the world, according to `` Secret Warriors: Inside the Covert Military Operations of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Era </PERSON>,'' excerpted in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report. The book by the magazine's senior editor, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, says the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> set up several secret units to carry out covert paramilitary operations after the failure of the 1980 attempt under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to rescue American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It says some of the operations were not disclosed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or to senior officials. The lack of coordination that led to the failed mission prompted the new administration to establish Snow Bird, to be run by a group of men in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s new Special Operations Division, says the book. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said his findings are based on a yearlong investigation, including information from hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The Noriega microphones were planted in 1983 by a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> group called the <ORGANIZATION> Quick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reaction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, which specialized in electronic surveillance, according to <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION>. The agents initially tried to bug <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s luxurious residence, but they were scared off by barking dogs and guards who opened fire, the book says. `` Another attempt met with better results,'' the report said. `` QRT agents succeeded in planting a bug in a lavish <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> apartment. But six tapes, each 90 minutes long, failed to yield any significant intelligence on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now applying massive economic sanctions, including a freeze on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s bank assets, in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation. The general also has been indicted on drug charges by a federal grand jury. Other findings from <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION>'s book include: _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials negotiated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and Libyan intermediaries to obtain the release of Americans being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to classified portions of private notebooks of fired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide who was a central figure in the Iran-Contra affair. One plan, which later collapsed, called for $ 10 million in covert payments to <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> organization holding the hostages and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Massawi </PERSON>, the leader of the Islamic Amal militia. At <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> actually transferred some money to <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> to get the hostages out, but nothing happened. _ In 1985, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence identified the location of the house where five of the six American hostages were being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The site was reconstructed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents as part of a portable mini-model used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to prepare a rescue operation. A detailed military rescue mission was planned, but it was scrapped when the Iran-Contra affair began to unfold. _ <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> sources said the man behind the kidnapping of the hostages was a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Immad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mughniye </PERSON> However, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Mughniye </PERSON>'s wife, whose relative was being held in a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> prison for terrorism, was running the show. `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mughniye </PERSON> was n't going to get any sex until his -LRB- wife's relative -RRB- was released,'' says one excerpt from the book _ Pentagon agents who discovered the Soviets had ordered a fleet of <ORGANIZATION> Opel </ORGANIZATION> automobiles in 1983 entered the manufacturing plant at night, took apart a car and embedded a transmitter in the frame Agents were then able to trail the car without being seen. `` The mission was so successful that a number of Soviet agents were identified and several Russian codes were broken.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s trademark Boy Scout smile froze as he peeked from behind the curtains at the Sunrise Musical Theatre. Stretching out beyond the stage he was about to take was a sea of empty seats _ no more than 400 people were at the 4,200-seat theater. He could see some people walking out of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting, following the end of the featured speech by former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> shook his head slowly, straightened himself, then strode out to give his campaign speech. It was a foreboding beginning to the final, three-day push to Super Tuesday, the 20-state set of primaries and caucuses that could have dramatically boosted the presidential ambitions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman. Instead, on Wednesday morning <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> awoke to newspaper headlines that called him the day's big Democratic loser. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the big prizes of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and five other states; civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won five states and the biggest share of the popular vote, and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the candidate <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign officials hoped to see eliminated Tuesday, was stronger than ever after winning six states <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> won only one state _ <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> _ and finished fourth in 13. He was left with one last chance _ the March 26 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses _ to keep his campaign alive. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> arrived here three days before Super Tuesday from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where his campaign's polls had said he was running neck-and-neck with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the lead. Polls in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> also were encouraging, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> seemed volatile enough to take from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s theme of correcting the trade imbalance and spurring domestic oil production with an oil-import fee. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, even though <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had the active support of the popular 87-year-old Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, the condominium community retirees were solidly for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After the musical theater appearance, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and Pepper campaigned at condominium complex. Fewer than 75 people turned out. Next was the annual Strawberry Festival in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. It was raining as <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> walked through the carnival-style grounds, and he attracted little attention. Two days later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would arrive to hundreds of supporters, 500 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signs along the route and a plane flying overhead with a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> streamer. In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was joined by media consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON>, given credit for helping <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> develop the populist theme that played so well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Arriving in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, late Saturday, <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON> was asked if his rare travel with the campaign was a sign of trouble. `` No, no, I just like to get out in the field sometimes,'' said <PERSON> Shrum </PERSON>, smiling around his big cigar. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> began Sunday with a taping of `` Meet the Press.'' The first questions were about his `` flip-flop'' on abortion. Meanwhile, both <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were attacking <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for changing positions on the issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running a commercial depicting a man in a business suit doing back flips, with a voice-over about <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s issue switches. Later, as <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s motorcade with the long black limousine drove into the border city of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, oncoming cars pulled over to the side of the road. A local <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> supporter explained: `` They see the black car and they think it's a funeral procession. It's tradition that you pull off the road for a funeral.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager, the campaign's `` spin'' specialist, was trying to put the best light on the upcoming Super Tuesday voting On Sunday, the spin was that even if <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> shared third place, it would be a victory for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> because his strength would be shown as comparable to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator's Southern stronghold. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s showing, as it turned out, was n't up to the spin. That night in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> invited the traveling press to join him at <PERSON> Casa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, where he had the Mexican special combination dinner and a Budweiser beer, brewed in his hometown of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> talked about his beloved <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> baseball team. Someone asked: `` Why did n't you stop in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and take batting practice with the <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> smiled ruefully, doubtless thinking of rival <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' much-publicized visit to <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> camp in Winter Haven, where the governor donned a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> uniform and took some swings in the batting cage. `` That was a good picture, was n't it?'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had drawn 1,500 people a day earlier, addressing Hispanic crowds in fluent Spanish. No more than 400, many of them tourists, were there as <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spoke in front of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, one day after the 152nd anniversary of the fall of the badly outmanned Texan mission to the Mexican army. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> concluded his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign Monday evening with a visit to the Johnson Space Center, where he detailed his Kennedyesque plan to revitalize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. But media questions concentrated on how he would do Tuesday. Asked whether any candidate could finish worse than third Tuesday and survive, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't know ... I know I'm going to keep fighting to get my message out.'' As the campaign headed to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where its ill-fated Super Tuesday campaigning would conclude, <PERSON> Trippi </PERSON> was talking spin again. He was talking about <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

 Women now head nearly 300 of the accredited colleges and universities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The number of women college presidents doubled from 148 in 1975 to 296 in 1987, with the most rapid growth at public institutions, said the council's Office of Women in Higher Education. But the fastest spurt was in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it said. There was a net increase of only 10 women presidents between 1984 and 1987. There are more than 3,400 two - and four-year colleges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; 2,880 are accredited Eighty-six of the women presidents, or 29 percent, are nuns heading religious institutions. Forty, or 14 percent, are minorities, including 22 black, 13 Hispanic, four American Indian and one <LOCATION> Asian-American </LOCATION> women. Since 1984, the office said, the number of women heading four-year public institutions has increased 22 percent, from 32 to 39. The number heading four-year private colleges and universities grew by 16 percent, from 134 to 156. Women also held the presidencies at 73 two-year public colleges -LRB- up from 72 in 1984 -RRB- and 28 two-year private institutions -LRB- down from 48 -RRB-. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavlik </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said colleges need to search harder and address inequities in hiring and promoting women. `` What's needed is personal and institutional commitment and determination to achieve the goal,'' she said.

<HEAD>Coping With Power Failures, Competing With Vanna White: Dole
Fights On</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When a campaign starts to slide, as <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s surely has, everything goes wrong, even the little things The candidate finds himself struggling to overcome power failures and competing for attention against <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The signs are everywhere that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination. He won a smashing victory on Super Tuesday and appeared poised to keep rolling on Tuesday when <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> holds its primary. Yet, despite the battering he has taken from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent contests, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> clearly sees a loser when he looks at the vice president. `` Sooner or later,'' he said Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show `` Face the Nation,'' `` the voters in one of these states are going to say, wait a minute, we're about to nominate a loser.'' But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s view was n't shared by many Republican voters in the South and does n't appear likely to find much support in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In fact, if anyone looked like a loser, it was the senator from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. After Super Tuesday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> needed a way to turn the race around. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came out of the South with a big lead in delegates _ 705 to 165 _ but the next battleground was the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had trounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had his hands full as he started his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign, still stunned by the magnitude of his loss on Super Tuesday when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took all 16 primaries. Suddenly word got out that the campaign was laying off most of its paid staff and was pulling all its commercials off the air in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Rumors spread swiftly that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was going to throw in the towel and concede the nomination to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That possibility clearly had been discussed and rejected. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said people were laid off because `` a campaign is not a jobs program'' and after Super Tuesday, paid staff was not needed in a large number of states. While that argument made some sense, the timing of the layoffs, right after a big loss, left the unmistakable impression the campaign was folding. The announcement on the television commercials was a case of different people in the same campaign giving out conflicting versions of what was happening. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, the campaign manager, finally said on Friday that all the commercials had not been pulled. He said many had been dropped in favor of a decision to buy 30 minutes of time for a major <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> effort to win voter support. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>'s version, as it turned out, was correct. Some 30-second <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> commercials are running in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. But the former secretary of labor was not around to provide an authoritative version when the word first got out. He was attending ceremonies marking the anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. The 30-minute <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> program, originating from <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Galesburg </LOCATION>, site of one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, turned out to be a showcase of campaign disarray. Eight hours before the program was to air, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> advisers were unable to say exactly what it would contain. Aides were scrambling to fill the 30 minutes. Nearly half of it was filled by a <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> biography filmed months ago for showing at campaign events. The message the candidate delivered was a restatement of campaign rhetoric, his contention that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not discussing the issues. `` The issues are more important than the odds,'' he said, portraying himself as the one who was responsible for getting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It was a $ 100,000 gamble _ and was all the riskier due to the decision to go live instead of taping the program in advance. In the middle of the program, there was an unexplained power failure that resulted in loss of the picture for several minutes. The sound was not interrupted. How many voters saw the program was questionable. It was competing against `` Wheel of Fortune,'' the popular game show in which Vanna White has become a celebrity for her role of turning around the letters on word puzzles. While <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was fighting for attention in one campus building, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was addressing a cheering crowd of more than 1,000 Republicans in the college gymnasium about 200 yards away. Tied as tightly as ever to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> condiently predicted, `` We are going to win on Tuesday because we have the people with us.'' In the battle for Republican primary votes, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is looking and sounding very much like a winner.

<HEAD>Restaurant To Give Homeless Alternative To Soup Line</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Inside an old brick building that once was a drive-in liquor store, a minister and a group of volunteers are putting the finishing touches on a cafe for people who rarely get to enjoy restaurant treatment. The cafe will be for the homeless, who have some of their basic needs met by the city's shelters and soup kitchens but are unable to enjoy the more relaxed and personal atmosphere of a restaurant, said the Rev. A.B. Short. `` I'm thankful for the feeding programs; they -LRB- the homeless -RRB- could n't survive without them,'' said <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, who has been involved in homeless aid programs since moving to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1980. `` But if you feed 500 people in two hours, you ca n't give much personal attention,'' he said. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said the restaurant will be relatively small, serving about 30 at a time, and will emphasize a friendly atmosphere over merely providing food to the homeless. `` People have a need for food, but we hope the interaction and relationships will be our primary product,'' he said. The restaurant will feature counter service as well as tables. The kitchen will be entirely visible from the dining area so patrons can talk to the cooks, dishwashers and other volunteer staffers, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. One of the main differences from the standard shelter kitchen will be that the homeless will be able to choose items from a menu, instead of just having plates of food handed to them. There will be no charge for the food, but a voucher system of tickets distributed by area shelters may be used, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said. A legal aid service as well as alcohol and drug abuse counseling also will be available on the premises, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> added. There are an estimated 7,000-10 ,000 homeless in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area Renovation work began in November with the help of $ 30,000 in federal and state grants. Several individuals and businesses have contributed materials or funds, and some of the work has been done by volunteers, including members of the homeless community. `` The idea seems so unique it has sparked a lot of people's interest,'' <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said, adding that he hopes the restaurant will be ready to open by the end of the month Once it is open, much of the food will be provided by agencies that already help the homeless. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said he also will rely on donations to keep the restaurant going. At first, the restaurant will serve for two hours beginning at noon. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said he hopes he can add a breakfast or dinner period later. Short, 43, a native of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, said the idea for the restaurant grew from his involvement with the homeless, which started when he organized a shelter at <ORGANIZATION> Oakhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, where he is a member. He said his church, which includes many social activists, responded enthusiastically to the shelter project. But he and his wife, who is on the faculty of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, wanted to go a step further. `` We decided that if we were really serious about the homeless issues, what we might ought to be doing is having homeless people live with us,'' he said. They have had homeless people living with them since 1982, and some of them now are working on the restaurant, located near the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for Nonviolent Social Change <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said he does not envision facilities such as the restaurant replacing traditional shelters or kitchens, but he would like to see it become an established part of the homeless aid network. `` It's just another piece of the very important work people are already involved in,'' he said.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official Sunday denied that the guerrilla group called on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> deputies to resign from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Such a call was made in a leaflet circulated in the Israeli-occupied territory and prompted expressions of concern from <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>. But the senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disassociated the organization from the contents of the leaflet, saying it was an adulterated version. The official said the leaflet was part of `` a plot meant to harm our relationship with the Jordanian government.'' In a leaflet issued Thursday and circulated in the occupied areas, underground <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders said Arabs should take revenge `` on collaborators and the lackeys of the Jordanian regime.'' It purported to be signed by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. It also called on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> deputies in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s Parliament to resign and `` return to our people, otherwise they will have no place in our land.'' Delegates of the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose 60 members are from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, refused to comment on the call, saying `` it is untrue and fabricated.'' State-run radio said <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> denounced the resignation call, saying `` it harms the unity of the two peoples in the two banks.. and only serves the enemy objectives.'' It said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> provided <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> with `` the real text of the statement, which does not include such a suspicious call.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war but deputies from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> continue to sit in the Jordanian Parliament.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday that winning in his native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> may give him the momentum in his adopted home state to upset <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the primary here on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won 54 percent of the vote Saturday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Democratic caucuses and 23 of 44 delegates to the national convention Upon his return to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was greeted with the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll indicating he was in a virtual dead heat with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the state's other favorite son. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has `` the inside track'' and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has the money, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a campaign stop at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sylvester </LOCATION>'s, a Roman Catholic church in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Hispanic Humboldt Park neighborhood. `` So here I am again, the underdog with the big bite,'' he said. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count shows <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> now has 423 delegates to 35 for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who sat out <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as well as last week's 20-state Super Tuesday contest. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are battling for the 113 state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> delegates to be elected Tuesday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who hails from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, has full delegate slates in all 22 congressional districts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has slates _ although not all are full _ in all but one of the districts. `` I certainly hope to win the popular vote and the delegate vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I've been a builder in this state for 25 years and I hope the people with whom I stood will stand with me on Tuesday. `` We will get support all over the state,'' he added. To ensure statewide support, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> planned a rally Sunday night in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the state's other major black population center. On Monday he planned to swing south to <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> and travel through the fertile <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmland with stops in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> and finally <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he owns a home. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was buoyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll results. `` That means in the last lap of the race, whoever has the most kick, whoever has the most strength in the last lap down the stretch will win,'' he said. Asked about the possibility of throwing his support to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was too busy running and winning to give it a thought. `` The message is winning _ end economic violence against the farmers and workers, stop the flow of drugs into our country,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is being asked these days about his chances against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the general election, if they were their respective parties' nominees. `` He certainly has a lot of baggage,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of the vice president on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supposed to be over the commission on the drug situation, yet drugs are coming into this country at a rate that threatens our national security. ...

 Some of the few <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Jews who survived <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s death grip on <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> gathered Sunday at a synagogue and at a former Gestapo headquarters, remembering the pain of the past and the shadow it has cast on the present. Prayers and tears mingled inside the city's oldest synagogue, where more than a thousand Jews marked the 50th anniversary of the Anschluss, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` No one can feel our pain, no one can feel our suffering,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> told the congregation. The meeting was the emotional climax of four days of solemn remembrances of the annexation. Political and cultural leaders engaged in an unprecedented public probing of their nation's role as victim and perpetrator of Nazi terror and continued to discuss the problem of President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. For many <PERSON> Vienna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s concealment of his German army service in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> symbolizes the suppression of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, leader of the Jewish community, drew loud applause at another meeting at the former <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> headquarters of the Nazi police when he expressed hope that Jewish suffering under the Nazis would be remembered. `` We can only hope that the high degree of consciousness for these events in recent days will not end next week,'' said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. There were 200,000 Jews in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on March 1938, when <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops swept into his native <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Today, just 6,000 Jews remain, a mix of Holocaust survivors and younger Jews from the Soviet bloc and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They have been exposed to a new wave of anti-Semitism in the past two years that has surfaced with the controversy over the <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II record. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> concealed his role as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> until it was disclosed in the media in March 1986. He has rejected calls for his resignation, saying he will stay in office until his term expires in 1992. A commission of historians appointed by the Austrian government to investigate <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> said he was in a position to know about <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> atrocities and did nothing to stop them. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> backers who argue the president must stay in office to prevent a backlash against Jews if he is forced to resign. He said the Jews could defend themselves. By contrast, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> welcomed Socialist Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> to the meeting as `` our good friend.'' <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>, who is popular with <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s Jews, also warned against losing sight of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. `` In the last few days ... we all tried to make the things that happened seem anonymous in some way, as if we were afraid to make it too personal, too direct,'' <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said. `` You have to call things by their name,'' he said. `` It was not an anonymous horror that descended on a people ... and then disappeared.'' Referring to the former Gestapo headquarters, he noted, `` Let the desperate screams that sounded from the cellars of this site, which we can no longer hear, be a reminder.'' Half a mile away, at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, former Socialist Chancellor <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisky </PERSON> reiterated his call for <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to resign, while Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> looked at the controversial role of the church in the Nazi era. `` The church did not do enough to protect -LRB- believers -RRB- against the temptations of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> regime,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said. On Friday night, neo-Nazis booed a <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> premiere of `` The Deputy,'' West German <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>'s 1960s play on the church's World War II role The only other overt neo-Nazi action came in <LOCATION> Linz </LOCATION>, the city of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s youth, where a recording of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s 1938 speech in the town blared from a hotel just after a monument to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims was unveiled Saturday. Police found no trace of the perpetrators.

 The strike at the Indian Head Mine is in its fifth month, but neither management nor union miners are showing any sign of backing down in their dispute over job security. The miners say they're still united behind the walkout, which began Nov. 1, while management claims the job is getting done safely, on time and at lower cost. `` It is a matter of principle. It is n't a matter of money anymore,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 8880. The union represents 44 striking miners and wants written assurances its members will be hired at other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> mines when work at Indian Head ends in 1992. The company refuses such a guarantee, arguing it would be unfair to its 350 non-union miners in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON> calls <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s tactics `` union-busting.'' But North American wo n't budge from its stance, even for wage concessions, said company spokesman <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. `` It's like the union asking us to give them a trip to the moon. It's just something we ca n't do,'' he said. Each side accuses the other of committing various acts of vandalism, ranging from littering roads with nails to knocking out windows. Talks broke down in early February, and no new negotiations are scheduled. North American negotiators offered a wage package worth an average of $ 18 an hour and more fringe benefits, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. As both sides maintain their stances in the strike, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prepared to hire 10 temporary workers who have n't worked at other company mines, the first such move since the strike started. <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON> said he was n't nervous about keeping his striking miners on the picket lines as the coal company maneuvered to hire replacements to take their jobs. The replacements, who are slated to go to work later this month, have been told they will lose their jobs if the strike is settled, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. The company has mailed letters inviting the disgruntled workers back, but none has accepted the offer, <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON> said. The striking miners planned ahead and saved money to ride out the economic storm of being idled from their $ 40,000-a-year jobs, <PERSON> Neurohr </PERSON> said. The workers, with $ 200 checks each week from the union's strike fund, are paying their bills, he said. But one miner on the picket line said some strikers have been unable to make their house payments. More will search out at least part-time jobs when the weather warms, he said. Meanwhile, the company said it was `` doing fine.'' `` We are making our coal deliveries. We are meeting the demand. ... The cost of production on a per-ton basis is lower than anytime in the last year,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>$3.4 Million Malpractice Award Left Family on Charity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unemployed immigrant and his six children were forced to rely on charity despite winning a $ 3.45 million malpractice suit because attorneys and a hospital caring for his comatose wife split the award. Those involved say the treatment of <PERSON> Linval </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>'s family is entirely legal under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, which does not recognize his 20-year common-law marriage, and does not allow the children to benefit unless their mother dies. `` We were sympathetic. All the judges were sympathetic,'' said <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, the high-powered personal injury attorney who handled much of the case. `` But everyone was locked in a set of legal handcuffs,'' he added. `` The culprit here is the law.'' The tragedy for <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>, 43, an illiterate Jamaican immigrant, began when his longtime common-law wife <PERSON> Maudeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, then 42, entered the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for what should have been a routine childbirth in January 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> ran a small store and had been the only support of the family after <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> ruptured a disk and lost his job as a school janitor. But something went wrong during a Caesarean section to deliver the baby, and Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s heart stopped. In the time it took to get her heart started again, Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s brain suffered damage that has left her comatose. The baby was born in excellent condition. <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>'s sister-in-law eventually called attorney <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON> after seeing his ad on television, and <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON> in turn brought in <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION>. There is dispute over whether the attorneys told <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> he and his children would be provided for under a possible settlement. But whatever <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> was told, quirks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law deprived the family of any benefits from the $ 3.45 million eventually awarded after 30 months and nine volumes of litigation. One quirk was that state law does not recognize common-law marriages, even though <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had been together almost 20 years. That means he had no legal right to benefit from loss of her companionship. The six children, ranging in age from 3 to 19, could have received money except for another twist _ state law recognizes their loss of companionship only when the mother dies. And modern technology is still keeping her alive in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, at the cost of $ 1,000 a day. <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> and the children wound up relying on the sister-in-law, who would sometimes drop off a chicken or a loaf of bread, and charity. `` I went to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and begged for food,'' <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> said. `` Mostly canned food, vegetables and corn. We were living by the mercy of God.'' The sympathetic judge in the case, Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reasbeck </PERSON>, eventually tried to give the family $ 104,000. But Probate Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> forced <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON> to pay it back a few months later. `` There was no legal basis for him to have it,'' said <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>. `` He was n't her legal spouse.'' The attorneys say their 45 percent fee, plus thousands of dollars in expenses, were legitimate and legal. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said the case was very difficult, and called winning it `` a home run.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> won a total of $ 1.8 million, but that money was put into a trust fund to pay for her medical expenses. Attorneys say the hospital bills will be paid out of the interest, and the children will eventually inherit the principle. But the fund's administrator, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Koerner </PERSON>, assistant vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Barnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, disputes that. He said Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s care now costs $ 380,000 a year, and has used up almost half of the principle. `` At the current rate, we estimate the money will last three years or less,'' said <PERSON> Koerner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>'s family was finally saved from destitution eight months ago when the court agreed to parcel $ 2,500 a month out of a trust fund on behalf of the five minor children. The money keeps the children in food and decent clothes, and has allowed them to return to regular classes. <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>, as their legal guardian, could petition the court to pull the plug on his comatose wife, whom he visits almost daily. That would allow the children to have what remains of the trust fund. But he refuses. `` We have been poor all of our lives,'' said <PERSON> Ayton </PERSON>. `` I can do without any of this money. Because to me, this money comes along like a kind of blood money.''

<HEAD>Wildcat Strike At Rome Airport Cancels And Delays Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scores of flights were canceled or delayed at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s main airport Sunday after ground workers staged a wildcat strike because they were unhappy with a tentative accord reached in a six-month labor dispute The strike at <LOCATION> Leonardo </LOCATION> da Vinci airport involved about 90 percent of the check-in counter personnel and baggage handlers. It was called by autonomous groups in defiance of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s major labor federations. <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION> canceled 30 flights scheduled from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Foreign carrier flights took off but only after delays ranging from 15 minutes to two hours. Some travelers were forced to lug baggage onto the tarmac to jet cargo holds. On Saturday, Transport Minister <PERSON> Calogero </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannino </PERSON> and federation leaders for airport ground workers announced a tentative accord in the dispute, which has been punctuated by day-long strikes a few times a month since September. The tentative accord, which would be applied retroactively from January, calls for a monthly raise of about $ 190 over three years and gradually shortening the work week from 40 -LCB- hours to 37 -LCB- hours. A baggage handler's current maximum regular salary is about $ 1,215 a month. Airport sources said the workers who struck Sunday want the salary increases granted over a shorter period. Travelers since fall have also suffered through pilot and traffic controllers' strikes as well as repeated walkouts by railway workers in still unresolved disputes. Railway workers in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> di <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, called a three hour strike for Sunday night.

 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have presented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a proposal for moving 40,000 Cuban soldiers out of the African nation, the Angolan foreign ministry said Sunday. A ministry statement said the proposal includes a specific timetable for a full withdrawal of Cuban troops. It said the proposal was handed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official Saturday after talks here between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials. The proposals for a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal are conditional on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and a halt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African aid to the Angolan rebel movement, the Angolan foreign ministry said. It also includes a proposal for peace in neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting South African rule since 1966. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, meanwhile, The Sunday Times quoted unidentified Western diplomats as saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Angolan government have met in preliminary talks aimed at peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Sources in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, however, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they had no knowledge of meetings between Angolan and South African officials. The sources asked not to be identified. According to Cuban estimates, about 40,000 Cuban soldiers are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to aid the Marxist government in its 13-year war against local guerrillas, primarily the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Cuban withdrawal plan specifically did not mention participation in negotiations by the Angolan rebel movement and its leader, <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. There have been recent suggestions from Angolan officials that talks with group members other than <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> might be possible. The South Africans have insisted that the rebel group be part of negotiations and a postwar government. Government-run South African television reported Sunday night that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had been in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> the previous day. The broadcast quoted him as saying he had been `` meeting with his allies'' because `` something was in the air.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was quoted as saying several African countries, including <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Keyna </PERSON>, were expressing open support for a negotiated settlement to the Angolan conflict and there was increasing pressure on the <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> government to talk to his group. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other East bloc countries also supply <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> with military aid and advisers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplies the rebel group with arms. After talks in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> in January, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had declared its willingness in principle to pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> group arrived in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> Wednesday to explore the possibility of further talks on a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal.

 Hundreds of Armenians gathered Sunday at a cemetery to demand justice from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in a territorial dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and to condemn the Soviet press for being `` criminally silent.'' The fight for control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has brought ethnic tensions to the surface in both southern republics. The Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> last month was the scene of a weeklong demonstration involving hundreds of thousands, and an ethnic riot in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> killed at least 32. Sunday's five-hour demonstration outside a 19th century Armenian church at the <LOCATION> Vagankovskoye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> swelled to as many as 1,000 participants and curious onlookers. It was the second mass gathering in less than a week by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Armenian community. Armenians hoisted banners declaring `` <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> was and will be Armenian'' and `` Shame to the Proponents of Genocide.'' A cluster of Armenian officials and activists, some of whom had traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from the republic to press the annexation cause, vied for a chance to address the crowd. Armenian film director <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baratov </PERSON> told the crowd that the kind of Moslem fanaticism he believes was the catalyst for the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> rioting can not be tolerated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` If this happened to the Armenians yesterday, it can happen to any nationality tomorrow,'' he shouted. The Armenians burst into applause and shouts of approval. <PERSON> Baratov </PERSON> said he was a member of a committee of 600 Armenians from all regions and professions that has come together to keep the public informed and to press government bodies to resolve the dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mountainous region, smaller than <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, located within the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. More than three quarters of the population of the region, which was part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> until 1923, is Armenian. `` The silence in the press over what happened in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> drew me into this committee,'' said <PERSON> Baratov </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Our press has been criminally silent.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency issued a brief report on the <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> rioting which was published by the major national newspapers. But reference to the issue behind the rioting _ the annexation question _ has been made only in small-circulation newspapers in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Soviet television and the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> initially branded the annexation drive an `` extremist action,'' which angered many Armenians who consider themselves moderates and loyal Soviets. Later in the rally, another member of the committee, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Garik </PERSON> <PERSON> Agabekov </PERSON>, urged the crowd to maintain order if they wanted to succeed in getting the government's support. Agabekov credited Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms for allowing the long-simmering dispute over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region to be discussed and decided openly, but challenged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to abide by its slogans and let the region's people decide their fate. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> voted in early February for annexation to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but the party's national <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the appeal in mid-February The rejection touched off mass protests in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s central city, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> Unrest spread to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> in late February when Armenians learned that Soviet troops had moved into the disputed region to quell the protests. The <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> demonstrations subsided after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for calm and promised a top-level review of the annexation appeal. The ethnic rioting on Feb. 28 in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> was reportedly sparked by Moslem extremists angered over the Armenian claims to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Most Armenians are Christian, while the <LOCATION> Azeri </LOCATION> population of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is predominantly Moslem.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Paves Way for Wide Variety of Phone Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The day is near when your home telephone line will be an electronic pipeline to a wide variety of information services. By punching numbers on your phone pad, you will be able to select the programs you want to watch on cable television, leave messages for callers when you're not home and, if you have a computer, tap into a host of databases by dialing just one number. The seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies went to work quickly to move their plans off the drawing boards when they got a green light last week from a federal judge allowing them to offer these services to consumers. Most of the companies say they will begin market trials of some of the services this year and that some services may become commercially available in certain areas by year's end, though nationwide offering is probably several years away. Voice mail, which acts like a sophisticated answering machine, is expected to have the most widespread consumer appeal and will be among the first of the services to hit the commercial market in most areas. This service would provide a telephone user with a `` voice mail box'' in which callers could leave messages when the user's line is busy or is not answered. The user could retrieve messages at his or her convenience. `` It's like a mail box, except the letter is by voice,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Laskowski </PERSON>, vice president of the information provider market for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, one of the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies. `` You can get and receive information but you do n't have to be there to do it. What it really stops is telephone tag.'' Users would not have to buy any hardware, like an answering machine. With the services, all they would have to do is punch instructions to the phone company on their phone pad. Many businesses have this service in their internal phone systems now, but such private phone systems are not an option for most households or small businesses because of the cost. The Bell companies say they have n't decided how customers will be charged for voice mail, but <PERSON> Laskowski </PERSON> said, `` It will have to be low enough for the average consumer to want to use it.'' <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, director of voice mail for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that `` to send a single message might be within the range of a postage stamp.'' A related service is called voice messaging, which allows callers to dial a number and reach dozens of recorded messages. Once they've dialed in, a message would tell the callers to punch a certain key to hear the weather report, for example, another key for a stock report and another for sports scores. Another application of this service would allow organizations to leave messages for members. Both voice mail and messaging by the Bell companies will compete with answering machines and could shut down many small businesses that provide live telephone answering services, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Laseau </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telemessaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We see these small businesses losing 10 to 15 percent of their customers, and that could put them out of business,'' he said. The Bell companies also are moving to begin market trials on services that will make it easier for computer users to send information electronically to other computers and to dial into information databases. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s order, the companies can transmit such information services but can not generate the information itself. They will be allowed to function as `` gateways,'' providing users with a menu of services they can reach. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> is the judge who presides over the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was stripped of its local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies four years ago. That led to the formation of the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies. Dozens of computer information services exist now, but users must dial each separately to gain entry. The Bell companies will now be allowed to provide a single phone number these users can dial to reach many databanks. Companies also will be allowed to enable cable television subscribers to use the touch pad on their phone to tell the cable operator what channel they want to watch. Under such a system, subscribers could choose from among programs on several channels and pay for what they watch, instead of subscribing to all the programs on all the channels. The companies will have to get regulatory approvals for any of the services they offer, and in market trials they will be trying to determine what is easiest for consumers to use. They also will be trying to develop designs that will be compatible from region to region, so that someone who is accustomed to the voice-mail system in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> can make a call in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and use the same keys for the same functions to store and send messages. Compatibility also would allow people to take their computer to another region and still be able to connect to local databases. `` There has to be a lot of industry cooperation,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Handler </PERSON>, vice president of network planning at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which does research and development for the Bell companies. `` Widespread use of these services is going to depend on -LRB- common industry -RRB- standards.'' Handler said <ORGANIZATION> Bellcore </ORGANIZATION> is helping the seven companies coordinate on technical standards, but each of the seven is developing its own products.

 If working with the children's toy Etch A Sketch is a spiritual experience, as artist <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosline </PERSON> says it can be, his murals using up to 278 of the drawing devices must leave him on a cloud. `` Everyone who sees these murals smiles,'' said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> artist who opened a one-man show at The Peace Gallery and Cafe on Saturday. `` It's a fun thing. It stretches the limitations of a child's art toy by putting it in another context, putting it in a gallery. The plastic Etch a Sketch traces black lines on a gray background with turns of the knobs on the front, and the drawing is obliterated when the device is shaken. But the temporary nature of the drawing adds a dimension to the experience, <PERSON> Gosline </PERSON>, 24, said. `` Your drawing is just going to be erased,'' he said. `` A lot of people try to make art permanent, but how permanent is anything?'' One of the murals is called, `` Child's Play,'' and features 72 Etch A Sketchs in a portrait of guru Sri Chimnoy playing the flute. Gosline guts the devices, sprays a fixing agent to keep the images frozen on the screens, then glues the knobs. He mounts the Etch A Sketch to the wall with Velcro. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, the device's maker, donated the toys to Gosline while he was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascale </PERSON> thought an exploding snail had blown his 5-year-old restaurant business to smithereens. Instead, it brought nationwide fame. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prouty </PERSON> was celebrating her 36th birthday with a dinner at <ORGANIZATION> Pascale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Restaurant on Feb 26. She was eating her second escargot when it blew up in her face. Garlic butter caused minor burns around her right eye and blinded her for 90 minutes. <PERSON> Prouty </PERSON> was treated at a hospital and released the same evening. The snail's internal moisture had apparently built up steam that propelled it right out of its depression in a ceramic serving dish, <PERSON> Pascale </PERSON> theorized. <PERSON> Pascale </PERSON> said he pleaded with the local newspaper not to print a story on the incident fearing it would hurt business. But he said the night the article was printed, escargot was the most popular item at the restaurant. Every snail in the building was sold, he said. `` We've won national awards for four consecutive years, and we've been nominated for a fourth star in <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pascale </PERSON>'s brother and partner, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascale </PERSON>. `` But this definitely added to our national reputation.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Sunday was touting his big win in his native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, while officials struggled to count the final ballots after a record turnout at Democratic caucuses. About 45,000 voters turned out Saturday, officials said. Even as he celebrated his victory, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> quickly turned his sights toward the next battleground _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which holds its primary Tuesday. `` This is a 50-state marathon race and we're now moving into another lap,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s adopted home state; the civil rights leader has been based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for years. In a television interview, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that at the rate he's going, he could lock up the Democratic nomination before the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. `` I hope by that time to have a majority of the popular votes. I hope my delegate total will correspond to my popular vote and on that basis I hope to be the nominee of the party,'' he said from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program. With 1,668, or 93 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 1,788 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had about 54 percent of the delegates to attend county conventions later this month. Nineteen percent were uncommitted while <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> collected 18 percent. Masachusetts Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> collected 7 percent and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had 2 percent. In terms of the 44 national convention delegates at stake Saturday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> apparently will collect 23 while 15 will be uncommitted and six went to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. There are also four so-called super delegates from the state. Nationally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s delegate total lags behind that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has 460.5; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has 423.55. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahre </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the estimated turnout of 45,000 easily surpassed the old record of about 25,000 set back in 1976. She said it could be a couple of days before all the figures from the counties are tabulated. `` The problem now becomes the county party priorities are preparing for their county conventions,'' she said, adding state officials must `` beg a lot'' to get all the numbers in. There's no official state certification of the results, she said. The credentials of each delegate will be checked at the county conventions and then again at the state convention. The record turnout for the meetings `` slowed them up and slowed up the reporting. But that's a nice kind of problem to have,'' she added. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said the record turnout was due to `` a flurry of final days campaign activity.'' `` I'm certain the proportion of black voters at the Democratic caucuses was higher than the overall percentage of black voters'' in the state, he said. `` With <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> being <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home state, there was a very strong incentive in the black community. `` Some of it was due to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s showing on Super Tuesday. Some Democrats felt that there was -LRB- another -RRB- candidate out there they could support,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> all campaigned in the state in the days leading up to the caucuses.

<HEAD>Transition In Tactics For Bush As Grip On Nomination Tightens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has virtually locked up the Republican presidential nomination, he is carefully putting some distance between himself and some elements of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record. In a major switch in campaign strategy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also is trying to broaden his appeal to Democrats and independents _ a massive block of voters that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tapped successfully in 1980 and 1984. The vice president signaled this transition in tactics the day after his most impressive electoral performance ever _ a stunning sweep of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries on Super Tuesday. `` The message will have to be fleshed out more, and more definitive,'' he said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said `` we do n't want to get out ahead of ourselves and launch a national campaign before we get the nomination. But I think you'll see him beginning to talk more about various issues.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later departed abruptly from his basic stump speech. He told an audience of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> boosters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Thursday that if elected he would create a special White House office on ethics and devise a new ethics code. It was a concrete proposal on a general campaign theme he has pitched since last fall. `` I am tired of being embarrassed'' by news accounts of ethical misdeeds by government officials, he said. He said his call for a White House ethics office should not be taken as criticism of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He said he was talking about `` how I would do it.'' In another part of the speech, he offered details on how he would try to attack federal budget deficits _ going beyond a four-year, flexible spending freeze proposed earlier. He said he would take a `` hands-on'' role as a participant in negotiations with congressional leaders. The Tower commission set up to investigate the Iran-Contra affair concluded, among other things, that policy-making went awry because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hands-off management style. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said early in his campaign that he intended eventually to talk of `` shades of difference'' in how he would approach things, as opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And that's what happened Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, endorsing Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the next day's newspaper, said: `` Nowhere have the Republican candidates asked or answered the kind of harsh questions the Democrats surely will raise in November about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, whose colors Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been able to wave more furiously than anyone else.'' So, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to hammer away at the theme of lifting the level of ethics in government seems to be an attempt to position the candidate to better cope with the Iran-Contra issue, the investigations of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the convictions of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said `` it was a big mistake'' for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to continue running campaign advertisements questioning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in supporting the arms-to-Iran initiative. `` This has created a lot of resentment in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and other top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists know they have not heard the last of the issue, particularly in view of the continuing investigation of the Iran-Contra affair by special counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could find himself trying to campaign against a Democrat at a time when administration figures are being indicted and tried in connection with the scandal. The shift in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy apparently resulted from a conclusion that the vice president has sufficient strength _ with 705 of the 1,139 delegates needed to win the nomination _ to shift toward a broader-based campaign. A dual purpose would be to lessen his vulnerability to criticism by a Democratic opponent of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's record on ethics and to reach out to blue-collar voters, Democrats, independents and others who have supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the past. `` I do think we'll reach out to ethnic groups and various minority groups,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said of the emerging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategy. `` He has consciously reached out to the Hispanic population in the southwest and to Cubans in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. I think he will work very hard to capture ethnic groups.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also can be expected to touch up his campaign pitch to appeal to workers _ as he did in acknowledging that not everyone has benefited from the economic recovery. He said the face of a jobless man in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> looks just as grim as the face of a man out of work in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Nepalese crowded hospitals Sunday and looked for relatives after a sudden hailstorm caused a stampede at a soccer stadium, killing about 90 people and injuring scores. Doctors at <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>'s main facility, the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said about a dozen unidentified bodies could present a health hazard because there was no place to properly store them. `` We have no room in the morgue. There is in fact no morgue to speak of in medical terms,'' said one doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity. The stampede occurred Saturday when a hailstorm struck during a soccer game at the National Stadium. Witnesses said the crowd of about 30,000 surged toward the one open exit, and many people were crushed or suffocated to death. Government television reported 73 died, and witnesses said at least 20 other bodies were taken away by relatives for cremation. More than 100 people were treated at hospitals. Three people remained in critical condition Sunday. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Niranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> said later Sunday that 70 people perished in the tragedy, including three police officers. He said 94 people had been hospitalized with injuries, and 15 remained in serious condition. <PERSON> Thapa </PERSON> denied reports that police charged crowds outside the stadium when they attacked government cars with rocks. Witnesses said police used batons to club people enraged that other gates to the stadium had not been opened. The government ordered a judicial panel to investigate the disaster and said it would pay compensation to relatives of victims and to the injured. Soccer is <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s most popular sport, and Saturday's game was the final match in a tournament between a team from the national tobacco factory and a team from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Government-run newspapers reported that the crowd surged toward the south exit _ where most people usually enter the stadium _ but made no mention of other doors being locked. They reported that King <PERSON> Birendra </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Aishwarya </PERSON> visited the injured in hospitals. The official national news agency reported that the government declared a national day of mourning Sunday, a normal working day, and ordered all sports events and other entertaintment canceled. At <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, about a mile from the stadium, one patient, <PERSON> Judha </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamang </PERSON> said, `` I got blessing from our beloved king and queen.'' Hundreds of anxious people crowded around one hospital building where pictures of the unidentified dead had been posted. <PERSON> Bhayacha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumale </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Thimi </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, said he lost two of his sons, aged 12 and 16, in the tragedy. A third son had decided to skip Saturday's soccer game. `` I could not even give them a drop of water before they died,'' <PERSON> Kumale </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, it is a tradition for relatives to gather at a dying person's bedside and give him water to comfort him. The stampede was <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s worst sports-related disaster on record. It came just two days after part of a grandstand collapsed at the main soccer stadium in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, reportedly killed around 20 people during a match between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Some of the 60,000 spectators at the 75,000-seat `` June 11 Stadium'' panicked when someone brandished a knife, news reports said. In the worst soccer disaster on record, rioting left nearly 300 people dead and 500 injured on May 24, 1964, in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> beat <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on a last-minute goal.

<HEAD>India Rejects Cease-Fire Call By Tamil Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Indian government rejected the latest call for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> from a Tamil rebel leader, saying his words did not match his deeds, an Indian diplomat said Sunday. He said the appeal by <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>, issued Saturday in the southern Indian city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, was one `` of a series of communications we've received from time to time.'' He noted that <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> had continued to attack rival Tamil militants as well as Indian forces sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last July to enforce a peace accord. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Sri Lankan rebel group, have refused to surrender their weapons as called for in the Indian-sponsored peace plan signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The pact was designed to end the Tamils' nearly 5-year-old guerrilla war for an independent homeland in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce the accord. <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON> has been in hiding since an Indian offensive against his stronghold in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> peninsula began last October. In his statement, <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON> appealed for a cease-fire but said he was skeptical that <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Sinhalese majority would abide by the peace accord. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus and who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> conflicet because of its Tamil minority of 60 million Tamils _ most of them in <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> and surrounding <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state. Although <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce the peace pact, it has allowed the rebel groups to maintain exile offices in <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, 250 miles north of the island nation of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Ceylon </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, Sri Lankan police said 15 Sinhalese had been arrested in connection with an ambush near the eastern port of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> on Friday in which 22 men, women and children were killed. Most of the victims were Tamils. In the northwest, two Sinhalese serving in the Sri Lankan army were shot to death Saturday 400 yards from the Adampan military camp near <LOCATION> Mannar </LOCATION>. Military sources in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said the soldiers were slain by <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas.

 A memo by a longtime friend of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> describes the two men joining in a 10-minute `` briefing'' of Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. The memo by <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, first disclosed in Sunday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> `` literally dragged me off into a corner'' and began discussing the pipeline `` intensely'' at an Israeli embassy reception in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Oct. 16, 1985. The document says that in the crush of activity at the reception, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> then asked <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to wait until after the event to discuss the pipeline further. `` Fortunately, as the time approached, my friend -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s usual phrase for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> -RRB- arrived and there was a three-way discussion which took approximately 10 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s `` He -LRB- Peres -RRB- is very quick and we went right to the point and he was agreeable in all respects. It was n't the kind of briefing I would have preferred, but it seemed to be effective,'' the memo said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' denied the story, while <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to comment on the latest report. The attorney general, asked if the report was correct, responded: `` No it's not. It's the usual thing you expect these days from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, taking a small fact that is well known and trying to blow it up into a new news story.'' `` Many times, at that particular reception I had brief conversations with Prime Minister <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing new to it. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also reiterated that he will not resign his post despite the growing controversy. `` Obviously I should n't step aside because if honest public officials can be hounded out of office by partisan political attacks, by media barrages, then no one as a public official is safe,'' he said. The attorney general said that `` at no time has this -LRB- investigation -RRB- detracted from my ability to do my job.'' Asked if he should step aside for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s sake, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, `` I think it would hurt him. And I think it would hurt the cause of good government more if I did n't stand up and fight these false allegations because to leave would acknowledge that maybe there's some truth to them.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, said that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s account totally exaggerates'' the discussion `` in order to impress his -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s -RRB- client.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was legal counsel to Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the proposed project. Two months before the embassy reception, <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> had paid <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> $ 150,000, which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> directed be sent to an account owned by <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, an investment manager at the time for both <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s money was in effect pooled in several stock trades with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s funds, sources familiar with a criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, asked about reports that he had profited from stock trades involving $ 150,000, said, `` I knew nothing about this money being paid.'' <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s company had a separate financial arrangement with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. The attorney general said that in any event his financial arrangements with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> were set up as a limited blind partnership so that `` I had no way of knowing what was being done or how it was being managed.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> described <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> as `` my friend'' and said he `` never asked me to do anything that was wrong. ... In this case, a lot of people are taking a simple situation where I turned something over to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff and then for political reasons or media attack reasons they're trying to make a big deal out of it.'' In a statement issued Feb. 1, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that his total involvement with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on the pipeline consisted of `` only two contacts ... each was brief and limited and neither was initiated by me.'' A second memo by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, also described in Sunday editions of the Post, recounts a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ a few days after the embassy reception in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ involving <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, then-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the meeting lasted about 15 minutes and that the four discussed two proposed letters for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to sign, the first committing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to disrupt the pipeline and the second dealing with the concepts of using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as insurance for the project. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has said he recalls having met <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> only twice, on social occasions with others present. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> eventually signed a later version of the first letter. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he could not act on a second letter without additional consultation in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo said. The pipeline project collapsed shortly thereafter for lack of an insurance package. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> saw legal impediments to using Israeli aid money. Finally, National security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, on the advise of former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> adviser <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, killed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the project. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with the proposed pipeline is under criminal investigation by Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who launched a probe of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities last May 11. The two memos were obtained from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s files recently by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigators, said sources familiar with the probe. The sources outlined the memos contents following the account in the Post.

<HEAD>9-Year-Old Solos In Ultralight Plane, Claims Youngest Flier Record</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 9-year-old boy flew an ultralight airplane solo for 3 -LCB- minutes Sunday, giving him a chance at being recognized as the youngest pilot to make a solo flight. `` It was smooth throughout,'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> said after piloting a Quicksilver GT Ultralight in calm, sunny weather at <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, while his parents watched. Ultralights, descended from motorized hang-gliders, are not regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which requires pilots to be 16 years old before they can fly solo. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, took off and made a touch-and-go landing on the runway, then climbed more than 100 feet before returning for a landing, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who observed the flight as a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he could n't say exactly how the flight might be classified by the <ORGANIZATION> NAA </ORGANIZATION>, which certifies aviation records. `` I do n't know, to be honest with you,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, noting that typical categories for ultralight records are in terms of speed, distance and time.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired a missile into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Sunday to retaliate for Iranian artillery attacks that killed 21 people in Iraqi border towns. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> vowed revenge, indicating a resumption of the `` war of the cities'' after an uneasy two-day truce. A 12-day missile duel on each other's capitals killed scores of civilians. `` If the Iranian regime continues its aggression, then our retaliation will continue with all-out strength,'' an Iraqi military spokesman was quoted as saying by the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, confirmed that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was hit. It said the missile exploded in a residential neighborhood killing and wounding `` a number of civilians.'' The agency gave no figures. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official spokesman as saying, `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Moslem combatants will severely retaliate'' and he warned <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> residents to evacuate the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. The spokesman, who was not identified, also denied as `` pure fabrications'' the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claim that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had shelled Iraqi border towns. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman, speaking on television, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke the conditions of the city-war truce by shelling civilian areas. He also said Iranian forces launched a ground attack in the central sector of the front. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will retaliate on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for one time, as a warning to the Iranian regime,'' said the spokesman, who was not identified. The Iraqis said a single <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missile, which has a range of 400 miles, was fired at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> 290 miles from the border. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman said 13 civilians were killed and 70 wounded in Iranian shelling of the town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, about 130 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Another eight were killed and nine wounded in other border towns, a communique said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it fired 71 <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missiles in the 12-day war of the cities, including 59 at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired 27 at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported nearly 200 civilians killed and hundreds wounded, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported many civilian casualties but gave no figures. The <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missile is named after a Shiite Moslem saint. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says the missile is manufactured in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but Western military analysts in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said it could be a Soviet-made Scud-B with strap-on boosters to reach <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used unmodified Scud-B missiles, which have a range of 190 miles, to attack <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of the border. The Iraqi News Agency said more than 1,000 Iranians were killed in the 3 -LCB- - hour ground battle in the central sector of the war front The battle began late Saturday and ended early Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not comment on the report, but the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> news agency reported that in a separate raid farther north, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and anti-government Kurdish guerrillas killed or wounded 450 Iraqis. It said the combined forces seized 15 square miles of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> land and 12 `` strategic heights'' in the <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> area 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Iranian troops in the central sector were backed by tanks and artillery. `` Infantry units of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> repulsed the thrust, exterminating the bulk of the force,'' the Iraqi agency quoted an unidentified spokesman as saying. It did not say where exactly the battle took place, but the relatively small scale of the fighting indicated it was not the beginning of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s long-awaited major offensive. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s last thrust, in January 1987, brought its troops to within six miles of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. But Western military analysts say <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has had difficulties mobilizing forces for a new attack. <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military spokesman as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> planes `` dealt an accurate and effective blow to a very large maritime target,'' a reference to a supertanker, off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the night. It did not give the exact time of the raid. It was the fourth such claim in five days. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had reported ships attacks on Friday and Saturday, but the last confirmed raid was on Wednesday when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes hit the Maltese-flag, 41,195-ton tanker Tenacity. Before the attack Wednesday, the `` tanker war'' had been dormant as the two belligerents hammered each other's capitals and major cities in a resurgence of the `` war of the cities.'' Scores of civilians were killed in both countries in the unprecedented missile duels, which began Feb. 29. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired a total of 71 missiles at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shot 29 missiles.

 More than 3,000 people carrying <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanting slogans marched to the White House on Sunday to protest Israeli policies in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Many of the protesters carried signs saying, `` Israelis: Stop Killing Babies'' and `` Palestinians Deserve Statehood.'' They condemned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, chanting, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, you will see _ Palestine will be free.'' The demonstrators called on the White House to freeze <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until the Israeli government supports and participates in the peace process. They also asked for a moratorium on miliary aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until there is a political settlement and urged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to establish direct contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who strongly opposes a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is due to arrive in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday for talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. Meanwhile, about 300 pro-Israel demonstrators rallied near the offices of ABC News to protest the network's coverage of the clashes between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and Arabs in the occupied territories. `` American viewers expect the whole story, not half-truths,'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Roumani </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, told the crowd gathered about a half block from the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> offices. The demonstrators later marched past the network's entrance before returning to their makeshift podium. Protesters carried banners saying, `` Half the Truth Equals a Whole Lie,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>,'' and `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> _ PLOs Man on TV.'' Many in the crowd wore yellow pieces of cloth to signify yellow journalism. A spokesman from ABC News was not immediately available for comment. Speakers urged the crowd to write or call the network to protest the coverage, while organizers sought signatures on petitions calling upon the media `` to report the entire story.'' `` We believe ABC News, along with the other major media, has been presenting a significant amount of news from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in a manner that is biased against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the petition said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposal to provide health insurance to every <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> resident by 1992 was endorsed by a key <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Sunday after it stripped the bill of an exemption for small employers. A final version of the bill, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has championed in his Democratic presidential campaign as a model for the nation, could be on the governor's desk by the end of the month, said Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are now three-quarters of the way toward having solved what is really a 40-year fight in this country to come up with a degree of coverage in health care that some of the other industrial countries have had for a long period of time,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olver </PERSON> told panel members. The committee adopted the bill 7-2, sending it to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, the governor's chief of staff, said the administration was pleased with the committee vote and was optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would produce a final bill the governor can support. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the proposal's earliest advocate, said she hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could begin debate Monday, so the bill could be passed and sent to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to work out differences. There are an estimated 600,000 uninsured residents in the state. It is expected that employers will pick up the tab for many of them through a series of tax breaks and pooled insurance proposals outlined in the bill. The House version pegged the state's cost over the four-year life of the bill at around $ 1 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version estimates the state's share at about half that. About 90 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version agrees with the measure passed overwhelmingly by the House two weeks ago, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. The two versions differ mainly over a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> amendment to exempt businesses of nine or fewer full-time employees from having to pay a unemployment surcharge tax if they refuse to insure their workers by 1992. The surcharge is intended to help pay for health care coverage for the uninsured. The House-backed exemption of small employers, which does not exist in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, would affect an estimated 86,000 employers.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Down, But Drop is Slowing, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drop in gasoline retail prices has slowed and may end as early as next month, an oil industry analyst said Sunday. The latest nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey found pump prices dropped .37 of a cent between Feb. 19 and Mar. 11 to an average of 95.75 cents per gallon for all grades and services, including taxes. That was a slower rate of decline than in previous weeks and the smallest drop since last November, analyst <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` This drop was barely over one-third of a cent, and several indicators point to rising prices during the next few weeks if crude -LRB- oil -RRB- prices hold,'' she said. Other factors contributing to a possible increase include refiners' need for profits, reduced profit margins for dealers and seasonal increases in consumption beginning in the spring and peaking in the summer, she said. According to the latest survey, prices at self-service stations were 86.39 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 101.53 cents for premium unleaded, and 82.94 cents for regular leaded. Self-service accounts for 80 percent of all sales, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Full-service prices were: 116.98 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, 127.27 cents for premium unleaded, and 112.75 cents for regular leaded.

Speaking with journalists after the Mass, he said of the car bombs: `` What we're seeing is a qualitative leap in terms of terrorist tactics, and this is extremely dangerous.'' He said such bombings could turn <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> into another <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where car bombs have killed hundreds of people in the civil war between Christian militias and Moslem factions that began in 1975.

 Passengers packed into trains and traveled under ground and sea to the island of Hokkaido on Sunday as the world's longest undersea tunnel opened to rail service Some riders had waited in line more than a week to ensure a seat on the first train that took them on the 99-mile trip from <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION> at the tip of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest island, <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Hakodate </LOCATION> in Hokkaido, the country's northernmost main island. The Seikan Tunnel is 33.4 miles long and 14.4 miles is under water. The Aomori-Hakodate trip takes about two hours, with 30 minutes inside the tunnel. Excavation techniques developed by Japanese civil engineers for the tunnel are to be used in the construction of the planned <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> tunnel between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, guest of honor on Sunday's first Hakodate-bound train, told Japanese reporters after crossing through the tunnel: `` It is a technological feat without parallel in the world It is a myth come true.'' Next month, with the official opening of the <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohashi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, a series of 11 spans totaling 7.6 miles linking <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION> with the island of <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>, transport officials will complete a decades-old plan of linking all four of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main islands by rail. But the cost of the Seikan Tunnel, which took 24 years to build, has fueled debate in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in an era of declining rail service. Overall construction and personnel outlays cost taxpayers about $ 8.5 billion at current exchange rates, well above the original forecast of $ 1.54 billion. The project also claimed the lives of 34 workers and ran 10 years behind schedule due to technical delays and four major floods. <PERSON> Yukinari </PERSON> <PERSON> Shojiguchi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hokkaido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which will lease the tunnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the new undersea rail line will operate at a loss. `` But it's worth it because more people will be coming through to Hokkaido and utilizing the region, which has long been cut off from developments on the mainland,'' he said. Figures released by <ORGANIZATION> Hokkaido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> indicate that about 2.3 million passengers and 5 million tons of cargo are likely to pass through the tunnel each year. <PERSON> Shojiguchi </PERSON> said a final estimate of operating costs still was being prepared, but did not deny reports pegging the annual level at $ 23.1 million. An 80-year-old ferry boat service between <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hakodate </LOCATION> halted operation on the eve of the tunnel's opening. Thousands of ferry fans visited the region for one last four-hour crossing over the churning <LOCATION> Tsugaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, site of a ferry accident that killed more than 1,100 passengers in 1954. `` A lot of people are sorry to see the ferries go. I do n't think many will be interested in riding through a dark tunnel,'' said <PERSON> Etsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomokane </PERSON>, a university senior from <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> touring Hokkaido during a school break. But Japanese critics charge that government officials erred in approving construction of the tunnel because of the low volume of traffic across the strait, and are skeptical of claims that the tunnel will spur regional development. `` As far as the current railway service goes, it's not likely that the new tunnel will help develop the region by attracting new companies,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, transportation analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. While a possible extension of the `` bullet train'' high-speed line up through the tunnel could bring a turnabout, some critics say the huge additional cost of building the line, which uses different tracks, would only increase the deficits. <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Takada </PERSON>, who operates a souvenir shop in <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION>, says merchants on both sides of the tunnel are worried that it will hurt business. `` Surveys show that the number of customers in <LOCATION> Aomori </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hakodate </LOCATION> will decline because train passengers on their way to <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION> -LRB- in Hokkaido -RRB- from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are less likely to disembark and shop around,'' he said.

A <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll of 500 Democrats likely to vote in Tuesday's primary shows <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 32 percent of the support and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 29 percent. But the poll, by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> has an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points, making the race a statistical dead heat. The latest poll, taken Friday and Saturday, updates one done earlier last week and published in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. That poll, with a similar sample and error margin, showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> holding 35 percent of the support to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 30 percent. `` I'm not saying every poll is inaccurate,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said while campaigning Sunday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>. `` All I'm saying is if I get my message across to the people of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, they're going to vote for me.'' Among other Democrats in the new poll, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was third with 20 percent, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> had 5 percent and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 4 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said 9 percent of the voters were undecided and 1 percent preferred none of the candidates. The newspaper did not update its Sunday poll of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters, which found Vice Presient <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the overwhelming favorite among Illinois Repbulicans over rivals Kansas Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and former TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The new <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support strongest in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which represents nearly half of the state's likely Democratic primary voters. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> did best in counties closer to his <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> home of <LOCATION> Makanda </LOCATION> and in the rest of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Support for the two was split among racial and sexual lines. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was strongest among blacks and men, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support was heaviest among whites and women, the poll results show. Among occupations, blue-collar workers supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> far more than other job classifications, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support was nearly even among all occupations.

 `` The Last Emperor'' brought <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> the Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s feature film award, the second jewel in what may be a triple-crown season for the Italian movie director. <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, who in January won a <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> for directing `` The Last Emperor,'' picked up the <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> award Saturday night in ceremonies held jointly at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> honor boosts his odds of winning an Oscar. Only three times in the 40-year history of the award has it failed to coincide with the Academy Award direction winner. Other top <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> winners were <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, who received the TV comedy directing award for an episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Family Ties'' called `` ` A' My Name is Alex''; and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Herskovitz </PERSON>, who won the nighttime dramatic series award for his pilot for <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething. In all, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> shows won three of the television direction awards, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> won two, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and PBS each won one. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had come in first in the number of nominations with eight. <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s competition was <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> for `` Empire of the Sun,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> for `` Broadcast News,'' <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> for `` My Life as a Dog'' and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyne </PERSON> for `` Fatal Attraction.'' In accepting his award, <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> expressed his belief that `` cinema is the most international and the most classless of expressions.'' The Italian director, who won permission to film `` The Last Emperor'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, also observed that `` cinema is living in shyness _ I might even say fear _ of television. `` Too many movies have been intimidated by television and have tried to imitate the rhythms and the language of television. Maybe I'm an idealist, but I still think of the movie theater as a cathedral where we all go together to dream the dream together.'' Other winners were: Dramatic show, daytime: <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochberg </PERSON>, `` Just a Regular Kid: An AIDS Story,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Afterschool Special. Musical variety: <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemion </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> ... Sound of Christmas,'' an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> special. Documentary-actuality: <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannes </PERSON>, `` The Kingdom Divided -LRB- God and Politics -RRB-,'' on PBS. Sports: <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, Syracuse-Indiana <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball championship game, on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. Dramatic special: <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, `` Foxfire,'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. Commercial directorial: <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, for three commercials: `` Trouble'' for <PERSON> Arnott </PERSON>'s Biscuits; `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Demby </PERSON>'' for <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>; and `` Apt. 10-G'' for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>. There also were several special achievement awards. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, director of `` The Sound of Music'' and `` West Side Story,'' received the <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Award, the guild's highest honor. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, longtime <ORGANIZATION> DGA </ORGANIZATION> treasurer, was named recipient of the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON> Award for service to the guild. Former guild national executive director <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who guided the organization through several important labor negotiations with producers, received an honorary life membership.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> choked off gasoline supplies to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Sunday after Palestinian protesters set fire to two fuel trucks and pelted others with stones. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday to meet with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The army confirmed an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> died after being shot in the eye in a clash last week but denied reports that a 5-year-old boy perished from burns caused by a tear gas grenade. The army said the boy had been playing with a kerosene stove when he was fatally burned. A spokesman said the parents initially blamed soldiers but later retracted the allegation. A police spokesman said more than half of the 850 Arab policemen in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> had resigned in response to a campaign led by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said at least 91 Palestinians have been killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories. Sunday night, police and organizers estimated from 200,000 to 250,000 Israelis gathered in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to back <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s refusal to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace proposals. At the protest, demonstrators held signs that read, `` Peace now, pay later,'' `` Yes to peace, no to withdrawal,'' and `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the Indians.'' The rally came one day after Peace Now demonstrators _ estimated by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspapers at 40,000 _ protested in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, urging <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, at an airport news conference early Monday before leaving for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he felt `` at peace with himself'' in his decision to reject the plan. He added he hoped his talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would advance the peace process. After two fuel trucks were set ablaze in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and others stoned, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> banned fuel trucks from entering the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army reported. A senior official in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government said fuel would be delivered to stations that serviced hospital ambulances and certain other vehicles. `` We will arrange for fuel deliveries only to places where it is vital for public services,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The army confirmed economic restrictions had been imposed on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION>, where an alleged pro-Israeli collaborator was hung from an electrical pole last month after shooting a child to death. The village will be barred from exports to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and will be unable to receive visitors from abroad, an army official said. <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION> is also without electricity, he said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> last month said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might have to resort to economic restrictions against the 1.5 million Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> if strikes and violence persisted. Police ministry spokesman <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> said 450 of 850 Arab police officers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> had handed in their papers after underground leaflets called for their resignations. He said Israeli police might be called to help. Former police officers wearing civilian clothes could be seen leaving a district headquarters building in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> after making their resignations official. One of them, <PERSON> Rames </PERSON>, 33, who declined to give his last name, said he was influenced by last week's brutal slaying in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> of a police officer who was accused of being a collaborator. `` The killing made me decide very quickly,'' he said. Dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> tax collectors also have resigned, and Palestinians have been called on to stop paying taxes. But a senior Israeli official said tax receipts were down only about 10 percent for January and February. A military court, meanwhile, indicted a soldier from the elite <ORGANIZATION> Givati </ORGANIZATION> brigade for manslaughter. An army spokesman said the soldier was en route to an army base when his car was surrounded by stone-throwers. The soldier drew his weapon and shot a Palestinian who cursed him, the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for the deportation of three more Palestinians after rejecting an appeal and lifting a temporary restraining order that had barred their expulsion. The three were detained before the current unrest. Nine other Palestinians were handed deportation orders Jan. 3, and four were flown to southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Jan 12. The move drew strong international protests as a violation of Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians in occupied zones. The divided Cabinet debated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace proposals, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the 24-member body would vote on the plan after he returns from his eight-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected several key elements of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan, especially its call for an international conference. But he apparently held out hope of getting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agreement for changes. The plan also calls for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that he would propose revisions to the plan.

 Forming the world's longest conga line with almost 120,000 dancers was no problem Sunday for members of the crowd that filled the streets of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> for the Calle Ocho festival. `` It's very easy: Just face toward downtown, grab the shoulders of the person in front of you _ and dance,'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, organizer of the event. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed a record had been set at 119,986 dancers, shattering the old mark of a 10,442-person chain formed last August in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` There's no way it could fail. As soon as the music plays, we just grab on to somebody and hang on,'' said <PERSON> Nuvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, one of about 1.5 million who turned out for the food and fun of what is billed as the nation's largest Hispanic festival. The river of people along 23 blocks of Eighth Street _ <LOCATION> Calle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocho </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ began to move when <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> blared their hit `` Conga'' from loudspeakers. On the street, 96 volunteers with bullhorns attempted to direct the traffic of dancing feet, while Ms. <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> shouted to the crowd: `` Is everybody ready? Let's conga!'' A special computer program helped count the dancers, and 30 observation posts were set up. Since the street was clogged, forming a single line was difficult, and untold thousands of people formed in a bevy of smaller lines in addition to the mega-line that made the Guinness tally. `` I've never seen this many people in one place in my life,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, who was vacationing from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` There's more people on this one street than in all of the Maritime Provinces.''

<HEAD>Medicaid Recipients in Nursing Homes Face Increased Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of thousands of low-income people who are elderly or disabled may have to pay an average of $ 50 to $ 75 a month more for nursing home care under a new rule issued by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, a published report said. The government said the rule, which takes effect April 8, would enable states to `` shift more of the financial responsibility for the cost of nursing home care to the recipient,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday editions. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said the new rule will save the federal government and the states from $ 160 million to $ 615 millon over three years, according to the newspaper. The change could affect 20 percent to 50 percent of Medicaid recipients in nursing homes or other institutions, the department said. Under the new rule, states will be allowed for the first time to eliminate or curtail the deductions they must now permit Medicaid recipients for medical costs not covered by the state <ORGANIZATION> Medicaid </ORGANIZATION> plan _ such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, physical therapy and prescription drugs, according to the Times report. Medicaid recipients currently deduct these medical expenses from their income before determining how much they must pay for nursing home care. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated the rule will require additional payments averaging $ 50 to $ 75 a month by each Medicaid recipient in a nursing home who has income from a pension, Social Security or other sources, according to the Times. In a statement published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, the administration said the purpose of the rule was to `` reduce administrative problems for states'' and to give them `` maximum flexibility in operating their Medicaid Program costs,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who represents nursing home residents as a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told the newspaper: `` The new regulation reverses a longstanding policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. There was no congressional action or judicial mandate calling for such a reversal.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could pass legislation to override the rule change, but has apparently not focused on the issue, the Times said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early Monday, saying he felt `` at peace with myself'' as he prepared to tell President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> he opposes a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who leaves behind a deeply divided coalition government, expressed hope for results in the peace process from his talks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` The state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was and is always ready to stretch its hand and to participate in negotiations on establishing peace in our area. No other people desires peace like us,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said at an airport news conference. `` I am at peace with myself. I know I will be able to convince my interlocutors and then all the others will say: ` Amen.''' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, supports the peace proposal worked out by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour earlier this month. `` Leave in peace and come back with peace,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> at the departure ceremony at the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, discussed the plan with Cabinet ministers for the third time Sunday but said he would not call for a government vote until after his trip. `` After I come back with a summation of my talks with representatives of the American government, the Cabinet will meet immediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a matter of about a week.'' Newspapers reported some 40,000 Israelis attended a rally organized by the Peace Now movement in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> Saturday night and called for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals and to end the 20-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Sunday night, thousands of Israelis gathered at the same square in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> for a counter-rally backing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Police and organizers estimated some 200,000-250 ,000 people were at the rally The demonstrators held signs that read, `` Peace now, pay later,'' and `` Yes to peace, no to withdrawal.'' A Shamir deputy, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, told the crowd that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> adopts the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace proposal, `` it will have to go to war in the future.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan is `` fraught with danger'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, repeated his opposition Sunday but said he would propose his own ideas for peace in the region. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal calls for taking two steps this year: enacting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and starting talks on the final status in the territories. Those negotiations would be kicked off by an international conference. For his part, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will suggest implementing Arab self-rule in the terroritories on a step-by-step basis, holding peace talks under Soviet-American auspices instead of an international peace conference and using a more flexible time schedule to start negotiations, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> Monday and will meet with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday, officials in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator and former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> also left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday, saying he hoped to make it clear to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials that the conservative prime minister represents only half the Israeli government. The other half, he said, would like to see <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> involvement in the peace plan. `` We ca n't appear as a country that refuses every chance for peace,'' Labor legislator <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Edri </PERSON> said on the radio. `` The time has arrived for him -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> -RRB- to return to reality.''

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political turmoil has been a wrenching experience for three Panamanian diplomats who are defying the sentiments of most of their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> colleagues by remaining loyal to embattled strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Two are described by acquaintances as showing signs of emotional stress as a result of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ordeal while a third has remained holed up in the country's consular affairs office since the crisis began more than two weeks ago. Most Panamanians attached to diplomatic offices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> closed ranks around Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who refused to recognize the February 26 change in government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and continues to support ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has declined to relinquish control over the embassy despite efforts by the Noriega-controlled government to replace him. A number of Panamanian diplomats elsewhere have broken with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as well. The latest known case involves the consul general in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, who notified <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> on Thursday that to continue supporting the present leadership `` would contribute to the disintegration of the Panamanian family.'' The three Panamanians in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who have stuck with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have close personal ties to the defense chief or his inner circle, according to friends and colleagues, all of whom insisted on anonymity. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for years, is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and is the highest ranking of the three <PERSON> Leyton </PERSON> is described by one acquaintance as having lost weight and has been keeping an unusually low profile. He has refused to return a reporter's phone calls. His principal deputy at the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Febrega </PERSON>, broke with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a month ago after being ordered to deliver an anti-U.S. speech which he felt contained misrepresentations. He said he also was troubled by evidence of corruption in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It was n't until two weeks later that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis came to a head. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> attempted to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but was ousted himself within hours in a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> power play that included a late-night vote by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the country's congress. Since then, <PERSON> Alejandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmiento </PERSON>, a consular affairs officer, has remained confined in the building where she works adjacent to the Panamanian Embassy. According to acquaintances, Ms. <PERSON> Sarmiento </PERSON> is worried that if she departs the office, she will not be allowed to return. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has taken no action to evict her. Ms. <PERSON> Sarmiento </PERSON> is said to be a friend of <PERSON> Nander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitty </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassador who is now a top aide to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The military attache at the embassy is Capt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Motta </PERSON>, the only embassy official who reports to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and not to the ambassador. As a professional soldier, <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> is not called on to make political judgments and believes that his role is not affected by political shifts back home. But a Panamanian diplomat who has been in contact with <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> said the captain has been under a doctor's care recently for high blood pressure, a condition which worsened after the crisis erupted. His appearances at the embassy have been more infrequent lately, and he often stays only for a few minutes before departing. The relationship between <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> and others at the embassy is said to have become strained. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has told <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> that he wants to keep lines of communication open in the event that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> wishes to send messages to the ambassador through <PERSON> Motta </PERSON>. Thus far, no communications have been sent. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> has been in contact with defense officials in an attempt to learn what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is doing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` He's trying to figure out what's going on ... so he can report back to his boss,'' the official said. `` But he's not in any position of trying to broker a deal. And he's not contacting us nearly as much as before.''

 Men in civilian clothes fired guns outside a church service Sunday and attacked two TV cameramen after roughing up a woman who was selling an anti-government newsletter. No one was injured. The attack came at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rey </ORGANIZATION>, long a center of government opposition activity, just as its pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, was beginning a late-morning Mass. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter and photographer said eight to 10 men first attacked a woman selling pamphlets at the entrance of the church, in a middle-class neighborhood near the city's center. When several parishoners ran to her aid, the attackers began firing handguns in the air and using large rocks to break car windows. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanini </PERSON>, an Italian camerman for the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said two of the gunman struck him and stole his video camera as he was shooting the scene. `` When they started shooting, I crouched behind a tree and when I looked up, I saw those two men coming at me,'' said <PERSON> Zanini </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` They hit me and took my camera away.'' The attackers also ripped a cable from the television camera of a CBS crewman and tried to seize the camera of <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency photographer, but only managed to rip off the flash device. The men threw rocks at other reporters on the scene. At least one of the attackers was jumped on by a group of churchgoers, but he managed to break free and join the other attackers as they ran for their parked cars about two blocks away, firing as they fled. A policeman watched the attack from a street corner half a block away, but made no effort to halt it. Asked by a woman why he had not intevened, he replied: `` Lady, I have nine children who must eat every day.'' The pamphlet vendor, displaying cuts and bruises on her face and chest, said she had been shoved and struck several times. She would not give her name to reporters. `` There are people here who would like to have names,'' she said in an apparent reference to undercover government agents. The government's opponents have frequently accused it of using hired thugs or plainclothed state security agents to break up its demonstrations. Two people were killed in separate protest marches last year when attackers in civilian clothes fired into the crowd. Anti-government activists have been waging a campaign since June to oust <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. His government has closed all opposition newspapers, radio and television stations. His foes spread their messages through handbills, mimeographed newsletters and photo copies of articles appearing in foreign publications. The opposition campaign is led by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor, political and other groups that was formed last June. Many of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> parishoners are Crusade members. <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> priest who is a well-known government critic, restored order inside the church by leading the congregation in a hymn. In his homily, he spoke of King <PERSON> David </PERSON> uniting the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The people had to suffer,'' the priest said. `` But out of that suffering came unity. ... Thus it will be for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Panamanians have had it too easy. Almost everything has been given to them. Now we are seeing the sense of nationality being forged under suffering. We are forging a new, united <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' As the congregation cheered and clapped, the priest then read a recent communique of the Panamanian Conference of Bishops that called for a return to civilian authority and the restoration of full civil liberties. `` This is the season of Lent,'' the pastor said. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will rise this Easter.''

 Communist rebels killed two soldiers in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s suburbs Sunday, police said. Protesters forced President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to cancel a scheduled ceremony inaugurating a housing project in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Rebel assassins shot dead Sgt. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Salalima </PERSON> as he was walking down a street near his home in suburban <LOCATION> Taguig </LOCATION>, police said. In a separate attack, rebels killed Sgt. <PERSON> Juanito </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Olazo </PERSON> after he arrived in his car for services at a Baptist church in suburban <LOCATION> Malabon </LOCATION>. Police said they found a note near de Olazo's car claiming he had been a member of a Philippine Constabulary intelligence unit that hunts down rebels. Also Sunday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> flew to Cagayan de Oro on the northern coast of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island Sunday to open a sports festival and also lay the cornerstone at a housing project for about 1,000 people, including former rebels who had surrendered. But the housing project ceremony was canceled after some 300 people picketed the site claiming the government was ignoring the needs of the poor. On a television talk show, political and business leaders, including opponents of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, announced they have formed a group that will seek to change the country's political system and economy. Opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said the 30-member Nation Movers For Reconstruction and Survival wants `` to change the structure of the government because it is too centralized.'' Appearing on the television program, he said `` all decisions now come from <LOCATION> Malacanang </LOCATION> -LRB- the presidential palace -RRB-.'' He also caid Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government does not understand the problems of people in the countryside. But the group is not uniting to oppose Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, said its leader, industrialist <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> who was on the program with <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. `` We want people from both the left and the right,'' <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said the Nation Movers want to change the country's economy, educational system and foreign policy, and will study land reform Asked about their position on U.S.-run bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the men said they had not taken a stand. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> operates <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and a naval base at <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, both north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, along with four smaller facilities under an agreement that expires in 1991. It pays the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> $ 180 million a year for the bases. The two sides are to begin a review of the bases pact later this month, and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is expected to ask for a major rent increase.

<HEAD>Porn Actor John Holmes Dies After Reported Battle With AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pornographic film star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who boasted of thousands of sexual conquests during a career that spanned two decades, died at a hospital, a business associate said Sunday. He was 43. Death came about two weeks after police again questioned <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, reportedly gravely ill with AIDS, at his hospital bedside about the unsolved slayings of four people. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> died Saturday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said adult film producer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON>, a longtime friend and business associate. `` It's a real emotional time for me right now,'' said <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON>. `` It's a real shock. He did die. It was last night.'' The hospital refused to confirm the death, and a nursing official hung up on reporters. The case has not been referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coroner </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> said the cause of death was not immediately known. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month quoted anonymous sources as saying <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, star of such X-rated movies as `` Exhausted'' and `` Tell Them <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON> is Here,'' was gravely ill with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It also was reported that he was re-questioned by police detectives about the unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four people in a house in <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was acquitted of the murders during a 1982 trial after jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence, but has never told authorities what he knew about the slayings. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, alleged at trial that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> led the murderers at gunpoint to the house at the orders of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> nightclub owner <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' palmprint was found over one of the victim's beds. Police and prosecutors alleged <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> sought revenge for a robbery at his house days earlier by people who lived at the home. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> was never charged in the slayings, but remains a suspect in the case, said Detective <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. During the re-questioning, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> refused to answer questions about the case, his attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Egers </PERSON>, said two weeks ago. Calls to <PERSON> Egers </PERSON>' law office went unanswered Sunday night. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was the premiere male sex film star of the 1970s and early 1980s, making hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands of peep shows in his career. He was best known for his portrayal of the character `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON>,'' a detective. Movies from the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON> series, made between 1976 and 1980, include `` Liquid Lips'' and `` Blonde Fire.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> once claimed to have had sex with 14,000 women on and off the screen. He also admitted after his trial that he had a $ 1,000-a-day cocaine habit.

<TEXT>
 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party invited opposition parties and groups Sunday to renew stalled talks with the government on national reconciliation. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, reading a statement from top party officials, called for a resumption of talks that would, `` in a serene manner, discuss all the political points that could preoccupy'' the civic opposition. The Sandinista statement also said the government would redouble its efforts `` to reach an effective cease-fire'' during talks with leaders of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels scheduled for March 21-23 in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Talks between the leftist government and its internal opposition are called for in a Central American peace plan signed by five presidents in the region last Aug. 7. The directorate and assembly urged opposition parties, labor unions, trade guilds and media `` not to continue provoking situations that explode the public wrath.'' Government talks began Oct. 5 with 15 opposition parties, but stalled Dec. 15 when the government refused to discuss 17 opposition proposals to modify a new national political Constitution, which went into effect in January. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused opposition party leaders at the time of allowing themselves to be used as instruments by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in its efforts to launch an invasion of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas maintained that any modifications to the Constitution would have to be addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Sandinista delegates comprise a majority in the Assembly. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Sunday that the Sandinista representatives in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> `` would not accept the discussion of the constitutional reforms.'' <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> said that opposition leaders were considering meeting on Monday to study the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal and issue a response. More than 40,000 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since November 1981, when the Contras began fighting the Sandinista government. The Central American peace plan calls for cease-fire negotiations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and a series of reforms to bring greater democracy to the region.

 Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., who underwent brain surgery a month ago to repair an aneurysm in a blood vessel, checked into <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday night so doctors could see if he is suffering from a blood clot in his leg, a hospital spokesman said `` We're going to give him a good looking over,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>. `` We're looking to see if there's a blood clot in one of his legs, and we want to make sure that if there is, it is not moving toward the heart or the brain.'' <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> was relaxing and talking to his wife, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, shortly after entering the hospital, and said there was no immediate condition report on the 45-year-old senator. `` It's not a routine examination, and it was n't planned, but at this point there's really nothing to worry about,'' he said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had undergone surgery Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his brain. He was released nine days later. Doctors found a second aneurysm in <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s brain during the first operation and said surgery eventually will have to be repeated, but that second operation was not expected to take place for several months. `` After surgery you do n't get a lot of activity, and it's possible for a clot to develop,'' <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said `` This was n't a planned thing, but he is awake and fully aware of everything that's going on. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president last June but dropped out of the race in September after he admitted committing plagiarism in law school, acknowledged that he had xaggerated his academic record and was criticized for lifting sections of other politicians' speeches without attribution.

 Weary firefighters worked Sunday to extinguish hot spots still smoldering in a brush fire that charred hundreds of square miles of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prairie. State and federal officials began a damage assessment, and Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>' office was considering whether to issue a disaster proclamation early this week. The blaze, which started Thursday as a trash fire, burned about 300,000 acres in one county alone, raced into sections of four other counties and threatened the towns of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> in northern <LOCATION> Callahan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just east of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> in the north-central part of the state. But hundreds of volunteer firefighters and three tanker airplanes dropping fire-retardant chemicals contained the brush fire Saturday. The fire killed livestock, burned trailer homes and oilfield equipment and closed roads. About 80 people who fled their homes opted to remain Sunday night in a shelter set up in a church across from the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, also with the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the fire consumed from one-third to one-half of grassland in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` The fire is still smoldering in some places but it's a case of flareups within burned areas. There has been no movement in the fire line since yesterday,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Millwee </PERSON> of the state Division of <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` The head fire has been in essence stopped. At one time, we talked about it being a 60-mile-long stretch from Interstate 20 by <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> and north to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>,'' he said. The charred area stretched about 60 miles long and 25 miles wide in parts of <LOCATION> Callahan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Throckmorton </LOCATION> counties. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and federal agencies met Sunday to decide whether to declare the fire under control, but put off the decision. `` The forward advance has been halted,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebarb </PERSON>, head of the fire control department for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lufkin </LOCATION>. `` Now, what we have to do is make sure the fire that's bumping up against our control lines is extinguished.'' `` Many of these big fires have a history of laying there and then coming back out. We do n't want that to happen this time,'' he said. Once the mop-up begins, `` that'll take about two days,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, public information officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll continue to keep an eye on it, because with the strong winds and low humidity, just a spark could start it up all over again.'' `` We've pretty well got fire guards around the complete fire,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McKennon </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> fire chief. `` We will have <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> crews out and some local fire units out, just more or less patrolling.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said about 70 percent of the total damage was believed to have occurred in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the flames covered about 300,000 acres of rangeland, or a little more than half of the county's 915 square miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> approved aid Saturday to help reimburse the state for expenses of fighting the fire in <LOCATION> Throckmorton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> counties, said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchoki </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It looks like the <LOCATION> Baird </LOCATION> area is well controlled,'' said <PERSON> Millwee </PERSON>. `` They had isolated fires last night _ mostly burns within the main burn _ and there was a little more of that kind of activity, hot spots to contend with, in the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area.'' <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, the county seat of <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> located 31 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, has about 2,500 residents. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> has about 1,700 and <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> about 350. <PERSON> Millwee </PERSON> said no figures on loss of livestock or crops were yet available and a monetary damage estimate had not been made. `` The county -LRB- agricultural -RRB- agents are working through the system, looking at any prospects for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> or other disaster declarations,'' he said. Mnay firefighters suffered smoke inhalation and minor burns, said <PERSON> Millwee </PERSON>, but no residents were hurt. `` It is amazing that a fire could burn that far and for that long and not do more than it did,'' he said.

King <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a popular campus figure, was chosen to replace <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, a hearing woman, who resigned early Friday after protests from students seeking a deaf leader had virtually paralyzed <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s campus. `` We will no longer accept limits on what we can achieve,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 250 students at the downtown hotel where the board had met earlier. ` I am confident we will walk boldly into a future without artificial limits.' School officials also announced that board of trustees Chairwoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON>, who came under fire from protesters for her handling of the crisis, has resigned. She will be replaced by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, one of four deaf members on the board. In a near-total victory, <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> announced that the board would form a task force to study composition of the board in response to student demands that deaf people comprise a majority of the 20-member panel. There also will be no reprisals against student protesters, <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> said. `` I took this step willingly,'' said <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> in announcing her resignation from the board. `` In the minds of some, I've become an obstacle. I am removing that obstacle.'' News of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s selection was received with joy on <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s campus `` We love it. We know now the university is going to be ours,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> graduate student <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who is deaf. `` He's the perfect president, the perfect selection. There was pandemonium in the campus gym, where about 200 students had gathered throughout the day as the board met. `` God made the world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giansanti </PERSON>, a deaf chemistry professor, told the crowd. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a finalist for the position when <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> was selected, stunned protesters by endorsing <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>'s presidency at a news conference Wednesday, but gave protesters an emotional lift when he retracted his backing of <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> the following day. Before becoming dean of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s largest undergraduate department in 1986, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, 44, served as a psychology professor at the school. He becomes the seventh president of the nation's only liberal arts college for the hearing impaired. Another deaf candidate who was considered for the presidency was <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> board member Dr. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Corson </PERSON>, the superintendent of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> School for the Deaf. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s appointment comes after a tumultuous week in which clamor for a deaf president grew from an isolated campus protest to a national platform for deaf rights. Students forced school officials to cancel classes Monday, when they blocked all entrances to the campus and prevented faculty and staff from entering. Throughout the rest of the week, students boycotted classes, and on Wednesday, more than half the school's faculty voted to back the protesters Gallaudet, founded by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1864, offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in 30 fields. Meanwhile, congressional investigators plan Tuesday to scrutinize <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s board of trustees and presidential selection process. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on select education is scheduled to investigate the university's bylaws, which allow the board to pick its own members. Lawmakers also are expected to examine the process by which <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> was chosen. Gallaudet, chartered by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1864, receives 75 percent of its $ 76 million budget in federal funds. The House panel, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s funding.

 The 130 members of a high school band from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> sang the school fight song Sunday to a schoolmate who has been waging his own fight against bone cancer. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Belding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> band and about 95 parents made the surprise visit to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wyler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where they sang the band's theme song, `` Friends,'' to <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> as he emerged from an elevator in his wheelchair. `` There was n't a dry eye in the whole building,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> `` He did n't know they were coming, and it took him a minute or two to figure out what was happening,'' she said. `` Then he started crying like all the rest of us.'' The band was on its way to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, to march in the St. Patrick's Day parade, and the musicians decided to stop at the hospital on the way to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. They sang to <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> because their instruments were packed up for the trip. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s not a band member but he is a good friend,'' said band director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiles </PERSON>. `` We just want to remind him that he's one of us and show our love and concern.'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was diagnosed as having bone cancer Dec. 10, a day after his 17th birthday, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said. Before his illness, the high school junior stayed busy helping at his parents' grocery store and working a part-time job at a hardware store. After the diagnosis, he was able to attend school several days a week between chemotherapy treatments, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said, but schoolwork had to stop when he came to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for surgery. The family had to sell the store, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where she stays when she is visiting <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>. On March 4, doctors at the hospital removed a bone tumor from <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s left leg and implanted part of a femur taken from a cadaver. They also installed a mechanical knee joint. The relatively new surgical technique, called limb salvage, avoids amputation, and should allow <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> eventually to walk normally, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Shuts Down Two Days After It Finally Opens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nine Mile 2 nuclear power plant, which began providing power on a permanent basis Friday for the first time in its troubled existence, automatically shut down Sunday night when a water pump malfunctioned, a plant official said. The $ 6.3 billion facility, described as the most expensive nuclear plant ever built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, underwent what officials term an `` unusual event'' at 5:45 p.m. Sunday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtch </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the problem occurred when the plant lost its main feed water pump, which provides water pressure to the reactor. `` The plant was operating at 99 percent power,'' <PERSON> Burtch </PERSON> said. `` But when that -LRB- the water pump -RRB- tripped, the water level in the reactor dropped and caused the plant to automatically shut down.'' <PERSON> Burtch </PERSON> said the actual problem was corrected within 15 minutes and the water in the plant was quickly replenished. `` But any time there's an automatic activation of an emergency cooling system,'' he added, `` we have to activate the emergency plan.'' The `` unusual event'' is the lowest emergency classification that exists for nuclear plants. Officials declined to speculate when the plant might return to full power. `` We're looking right now to determine the cause, but obviously we're not going to start back up until we know what went wrong,'' <PERSON> Burtch </PERSON> said Sunday night. `` We'll know more tomorrow.'' The 1,080-megawatt plant, which was supposed to have been completed in 1977 at a cost of $ 423 million, began providing power on a permanent basis when plant operators declared it `` on-line'' around 3 p.m. Friday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> claims that <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government forces have arbitrarily arrested, tortured and executed hundreds of unarmed civilians since fighting against rebels intensified in 1984. The London-based organization said that its interviews with more than 70 refugees and statements from independent investigators have produced the names of more than 200 victims, most of whom belonged to minority ethnic tribes including the <LOCATION> Karens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kachins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mons </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kayahs </PERSON> and Shans. In its February newsletter, the human rights organization said the victims were attacked `` apparently because of their non-violent political opinions or activities, their ethnic origins or language.'' The newsletter was available Monday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. It said the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government has not responded to several letters in which <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> expressed its concern. A dozen ethnic groups have been fighting the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government for decades, saying it has denied them the autonomy they were entitled to under the terms in which <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> granted independence to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in 1948. The newsletter said most of the people it blamed for human rights violations were army troops engaged in counter-insurgency operations in zones suspected of being under rebel influence. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the Special Branch and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also were implicated, it said. `` Eyewitnesses describe numerous instances in which Burmese troops shot and killed unarmed villagers on suspicion of association with the insurgent <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>,'' the newsletter said. `` In many cases people were apparently killed on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations from informers.'' `` Other first-hand accounts described summary executions of Karens, who had been taken by army units either at random or as punishment for suspected political offenses or sympathies, to work as porters or guides,'' the report added.

<TEXT>
 Recent political developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have put <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the awkward position of having to choose between pleasing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or maintaining good relations with its top Latin American trading partner. Foreign Ministry officials have withheld an official position on the government installed by military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manual </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> apparently plays for time, hoping to avoid aggravating the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which regards ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate ruler. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s considerable commercial interests in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> give <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> strong incentive to maintain good relations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not only a major consumer of Japanese goods, it also controls the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, a vital link for Japanese cars headed for the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and agricultural products returning to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On Feb. 25, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> ordered the resignation of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The next day, however, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, dismissed <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and appointed <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as president. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked Japanese Counselor for Political Affairs <PERSON> Ryozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> to explain <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s position on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> in turn explained <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Foreign Ministry officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> simply has not decided whether to recognize <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s government. They refused to give any indication of when such a decision will be made. Rumors that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> had in effect recognized the new government by sending its ambassador to <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s inauguration were untrue, said one ministry official. `` The presense of our counselor, instead of the ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION>'s inaugural ceremony is a sign of uncertainty,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We have not yet decided.'' <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> may find it difficult to distance itself from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> several times in recent years in his capacity as head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a $ 3.2 billion trade surplus with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s second-largest trading partner after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In turn, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest export market in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as well as the top recipient of Japanese direct investment in the region. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> absorbed $ 2.4 billion, or 51 percent, of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s private direct investment in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1986 _ one-tenth of all direct investment by Japanese companies. It received 41 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 15.6 billion accumulative direct investment in the region from 1951 to 1985, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese companies have financed economic development projects, medical and educational facilities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that aside from a halt to all banking activities, which has prevented business among Japanese banks operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, recent political unrest has had little effect on Japanese commercial activities in the nation. `` So far there is no cause to expect any major problems,'' she said. Since banks can no longer issue letters of credit, `` In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, everyday is Sunday,'' said <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasebe </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> External Trade Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> JETRO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers including Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, who favors a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, have expressed concern that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> might follow its economic interests in recognizing <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s government <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said a number of legislators hoped to see `` that the Japanese do not become involved in helping to finance and prop up this dictator for their own private economic gain.'' <ORGANIZATION> JETRO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Hasebe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> probably would `` have to cooperate'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and reject <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government _ a move that could have some economic costs. `` There are many banks and manufacturers with businesses in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but no factories,'' <PERSON> Hasebe </PERSON> said. He said some of the Japanese firms are paper companies set up as tax havens. While <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> has given no official indication that it would recognize the government put in place by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a clear interest in ensuring its access to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Japanese ships accounted for 13.1 percent of the 64.5 million tons of cargo shipped through the canal from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in the 1985 fiscal year ending in September 1986, including many of its cars destined for markets in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the same period, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounted for 26.1 million tons, or 35.2 percent of the total 74.2 million tons shipped from <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ships petroleum from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, grain from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and iron ore from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> through the canal. <PERSON> Hasebe </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> JETRO </ORGANIZATION> said there was little concern that the canal, which is jointly operated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, would be closed to traffic. `` All the government can do right now is wait and see, looking at the future of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be about to lose an ally in the case of the missing zeroes, a clerical error on a financial document that could cost the company tens of millions of dollars. In a case that is the talk of the town among bankruptcy lawyers, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> is trying to establish in court that a mortgage lien it holds is for $ 92,885,000. The problem is that someone mistakenly left three zeroes off a form and recorded the lien's value as only $ 92,885 _ one-tenth of 1 percent as much. The lien is on eight huge container ships that belonged to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION>, a giant shipping company whose assets are being sold off to satisfy creditors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> agreed in principle in January not to contest <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s claims about the value of its lien in return for payments from <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> totaling up to $ 5.45 million. But with a hearing to wrap up that agreement scheduled for this Wednesday before Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschman </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> seems to be on the verge of demanding a larger payment from <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> _ and possibly challenging the lien's validity if <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> does n't go along. Because <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> holds a first preferred ship mortgage stemming from a $ 160 milion loan to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> made in 1978, it can collect all the money raised from the sale of the eight ships, up to the amount of its lien. A lawyer for <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lines </LOCATION> last week refused to say whether the company planned to oppose <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> over the missing zeroes, but made it clear he feels the shipping company has leverage over the insurer. `` We believe we're on sound ground that the mortgage can be avoided for the benefit of all <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornberg </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Milbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tweed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hadley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McCloy </PERSON>. The sale of the first five of the Lancer-class ships earlier this month brought in $ 44.1 million, nearly triple what was expected, and other creditors are clamoring that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> deserves a payment from <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> of more than $ 5.45 million. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s law firm, <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gotshal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. Lawyers in the case clearly have little sympathy for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that the dropped zeroes amount to nothing more than a harmless mistake. `` The Federal Ship Mortgage Act is a notice statute that has very strict reporting requirements,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayerson </PERSON>, a lawyer at <ORGANIZATION> Kelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> representing <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which shares a second mortgage on the ships. `` My client actually lent $ 57 million to the debtor, so anything it does to try to obtain the repayment of that is certainly to be expected,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> says the lien was improperly recorded by someone at the law firm of <LOCATION> Haight </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, Poor and Havens. It says if its lien is not upheld it may file malpractice suits against <PERSON> Haight </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and its overall outside counsel on the transaction, <LOCATION> Dewey </LOCATION>, Ballantine, <PERSON> Bushby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. Attorneys for those firms have declined comment on the malpractice matter.

<HEAD>Japanese Chip Shortage Hits U.S. Computer Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A shortage of Japanese computer chips is rattling the domestic computer industry, with prices of some important memory chips doubling in the past year, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that chips selling under contract for $ 2.15 a year ago now are in short supply, and their prices have shot up to the $ 5 range. Some companies are buying chips on the spot market at even higher prices to get extra supplies. `` The price of chips is out of hand,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavuto </PERSON>, editor of an industry newsletter, Micro Publishing Report. `` Chips are the fuel of the computer industry. It keeps us running and there should be an unlimited supply.'' Some industry observers trace the problem to a 1986 semiconductor trade agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The accord set up fair market value prices for semiconductors, such as essential memory chips used in computers. It banned third-country dumping and the Japanese agreed to open up their economy more to American products. But at the time, most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies had dropped out of the memory chip business completely. Only two companies, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, still make dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, an essential memory chip for semiconductors. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has 90 percent of the D-RAM market, according to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> market research company, <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We send our procurement people to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> all the time and use every bit of leverage we can bring to bear to make sure we're getting our share,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Semiconductor makers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> deny they deliberately are short-changing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> They say the time-consuming conversion of factories to develop D-RAMs instead of 256 kilobit chips and increased demand have caused the chip shortage. `` They -LRB- Japanese suppliers -RRB- have to wait and see to avoid oversupply and charges of dumping,'' said <PERSON> Michihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. `` It takes time to put a new production system into orbit.'' <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> predicted Japanese companies would catch up with chip demand later this year.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday it was in discussions regarding a cash buyout of more than $ 75 a share, or about $ 2.35 billion, and its board of directors expected to consider definitive bids at a Wednesday meeting. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> also indicated it would drop its `` poison pill'' anti-takeover plan if more than 50 percent of the company's shares were bought under a formal tender offer <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has offered $ 73 per share, or about $ 2.27 billion in cash for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, has sought removal of the poison pill and demanded more financial information since launching its hostile takeover attempt in February. `` Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> has been provided with the same information as that provided to other potential bidders and has been invited to meet with management and submit its own bid,'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued from its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s lawyers were expecting the information on Sunday and the company likely would have no statement before deciding whether to sweeten its outstanding offer, spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. American Standard rose $ 1 to $ 73.25 a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> dipped 25 cents to $ 17.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, said an offer of more than $ 75 a share would top <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s current offer and would relegates <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>'s own defensive recapitalization plan _ which would pay shareholders a package of cash and securities valued at about $ 71 a share _ to a back burner. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> declined to give other information about third-party offers or to disclose how many bidders were involved in discussions with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, a plumbing and air conditioning manufacturing company. `` This -LRB- $ 75 bid -RRB- emerged from the discussions,'' he said. While noting there was no assurance the $ 75 bid would be accepted, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> cited the new developments in saying it would drop its poison pill, which makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by requiring the surviving company to buy back shareholders' stock at half of market value. `` Noboby could have done it with the poison pill,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> has fought <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s bid for months, rejecting its overtures, developing the recapitalization plan to thwart the takeover and winning a court battle validating its poison pill.

<HEAD>After The Crash</HEAD>

 Their confidence undermined by the collapse of their favorite stocks last October, to say nothing about the destruction of pet theories, some analysts are reaching into history for guidance. And those who do so have a tendency to remain bearish. The reason for this is n't difficult to discern, because a retracing of prior declines, such as in 1929, is n't unusual for subsequent rallies. Often, however, those rallies lead only to further collapses. At its post-crash high of 2,072 points a week ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average had risen more than 320 points, or 20 percent, from its Oct. 19 bottom of 1,738. The comparison with 1929 is as hard to avoid as it is painful to recall. Four-and-a-half months after the debacle of October 1929 the industrial average had recovered 43 percent of its late 1929 decline, and a bit more than one month later it reached its high for 1930. But, <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reminds us, `` within seven months all of that recovery was lost, and the downward spiral which would last until July 1932 was resumed.'' While the year 1929 is imprinted on every schoolkid's mind, the further collapse from early 1930 to mid-1932 was several times larger, and at some points along the way the descent was just as precipitous. But history can also be a treacherous guide; while it teaches, it can deceive, too. The years 1929 and 1987 have certain similarities, especially in regard to economic excesses, but the differences are probably more numerous. To begin with, the economy currently shows few signs of collapse, even in spite of some enormous and unpredictable excesses in matters such as budget deficits, credit extension and trade balances. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and others point out that today's economy is still creating jobs at a strong level, the service sector is growing, manufacturing has been gaining strength, and after years of decline the nation's exports are increasing. There are few signs of recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economic model released today shows gross national product rising only 2.1 percent this year, compared with 2.9 percent in 1987. That's anemic to be sure, but still growth. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, economic adviser at the board _ an independent group supported largely by business _ says the economy has simply entered an inevitable retrenchment, `` but does not seem poised for a recession.'' In the market itself there are signs of heightened activity, especially regarding stocks of companies that are takeover targets. Merger mania has gripped the marketplace once more, and some of the premiums offered for companies seem beyond reason. Less obvious, however, have been areas of underpricing in the market. Business Week magazine calls the over-the-counter market, where many smaller companies are traded, a bargain-hunter's paradise for undervalued shares These stocks, some of which could be tomorrow's blue chips, failed to rise to the sky during the industrial average's long ascent. Moreover, they fell more sharply than blue chips during the October collapse. Now, many of these stocks are selling far below their net cash value and so have begun attracting the interest of what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> suggests are rather sensible investors. It might, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, be a good sign for the entire market. While conceding that such activity might not continue, it suggests to him that for the moment, at least, `` rational investors are regaining some control of the market.''
