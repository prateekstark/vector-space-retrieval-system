 Film legend <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, a six-time Oscar winner for such films as `` The Lost Weekend'' and `` The Apartment,'' on Monday night became the 25th recipient of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> Award. The award goes to `` a creative producer whose body of work reflects a consistently high quality of motion picture production.'' It is given only when the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> decides there is a deserving recipient. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, 81, has had a movie career of nearly 60 years, during which he has been nominated for an Oscar 21 times. `` As I look back, I've lived a charmed life,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said, after being honored by the audience with a standing ovation. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> recounted how he had left <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to escape the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, and was granted a chance to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by a consular official in <LOCATION> Mexicali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who asked <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> what he did for a living. Upon hearing <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> wrote movies, the official stamped his passport and said, `` Write some good ones. `` That was 54 years ago, I've tried ever since,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said. In 1961, he became the first person to win three Oscars at once for producing, directing and co-writing on `` The Apartment,'' best picture for 1960. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s career began in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and continued after he fled the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1933. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. When he arrived in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, he spoke fewer than 100 words of English and took up residence in the ladies' room of the Chateau Marmont Hotel. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> won Academy Awards for both directing and co-writing `` The Lost Weekend'' in 1945.

<HEAD>Scientists Discover New Anti-Clotting Enzymes In Leech Saliva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Israeli scientists have reported discovering two enzymes in leech saliva that help keep blood from clotting and may be used to fight blood disorders and facilitate surgery. `` We found two enzymes never reported before: collagenase, which breaks down collagen, and apyrase, which breaks down ADP -LRB- adenosine diphosphate -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigbi </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said collagen and ADP induce blood cells called platelets to stick together, the first step in blood clotting. He and research partners <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Orevi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldor </PERSON> have been studying leech saliva for three years. Scientists have known of the fluid's anti-clotting qualities for a century. Three decades ago, a German scientist isolated and identified hirudin, a protein contained in leech saliva that now is considered the most powerful anti-coagulent agent available. Progress in research was hampered because of the scarcity of leech saliva until a new technique was developed by by <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galun </PERSON>, a research scientist in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parasitology </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She prepared arginine, a solution of amino acid, and placed it over a membrane of dried calf intestine. She found that leeches took to the solution as an alternative to blood. After leeches drank their fill scientists squeezed them to force out the liquid, which also contained saliva, and the thirsty leeches went back for more. `` The technique gave us two advantanges,'' <PERSON> Rigbi </PERSON> said. `` We start with a much purer material and we can repeat the process several times.'' He found several small molecules that also contribute to the anti-hemostatic process, the researcher said. `` It seems that the leech has a battery of components which inhibit platelet aggregation by a variety of agents,'' he said. `` This is the lesson we are getting. It may also be a lesson for physicians that a certain balance of drugs is necessary in the treatment of patients suffering blood disorders.'' <PERSON> Rigbi </PERSON> said his team found another enzyme called eglin, which he described as `` an inhibitor of elastase, produced by white blood cells,'' and is trying to identify its chemical components to isolate them from the saliva and reproduce them as drugs. `` We have grounds to believe we will discover some unknown compounds,'' he said. The research has aroused commercial interest and <PERSON> Eldor </PERSON>, who is associated with <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, is working on practical applications, <PERSON> Rigbi </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Each of the past four Sundays the ghost of treachery joined Britons at the breakfast table. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, the gentleman traitor who spied for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, granted his first interview to a Western journalist since defecting to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1963 and it appeared in the Sunday Times. Critics say publication of the four-part interview in the Times, which has a circulation of 1.4 million, was a propaganda gift to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet secret police agency still employs <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, now 76. For journalist <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> the evening of Jan. 19, when he entered <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s apartment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, climaxed 20 years in which he secretly corresponded with <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> but the master spy repeatedly refused to see him. When he did agree to talk, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> dropped no bombshells. But the myriad details reveal an English gentleman who despised his privileged background, espoused Soviet communism as a <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels of British intelligence in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s service. Because of his high contacts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> was able to betray the whole Western alliance. He sent many Western agents to their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat who threatened to expose him. The most controversial point in the interview is <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s contention that <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> intelligence let him defect rather than face an embarrassing public trial He told <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> he suffered severe self-doubt after fleeing to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and began drinking heavily. `` Doubt is a terrible thing,'' he said. `` Had I done the right thing? You see, I never swallowed everything -LRB- about Soviet communism -RRB-. I never took it ALL in.'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> said he has found peace and a happy fourth marriage, to a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman, feels at home in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and believes today's <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> would be a foreign country to him. `` No faith? Come, come,'' he said. `` Only a fool would deny me my faith.'' He likes to keep in touch with British gossip, listens to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, does the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> crossword and misses English mustard. Ever the English gentleman, he greeted <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> at his door with a cheerful: `` Come on through, dear chap.'' `` I do n't like deceiving people, especially friends, and contrary to what some people believe I feel very badly about it,'' he said in the interview. `` But then, decent soldiers feel badly about the necessity of killing in wartime.'' The unmasking after <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> had been under suspicion for 12 years climaxed a nightmare episode for British intelligence. It began in 1951 with the defection of top spies <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> and reverberated into the 1980s with the revelation that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, another upper-class Englishman, had been unmasked as a traitor secretly and went unpunished. When <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> defected, Blunt was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for information. He later became art adviser to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Blunt died in 1983 but the scandal continues to shake the intelligence establishment. There are allegations that the late Sir <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, director of the MI5 intelligence service from 1956 to 1965, also worked for the KBG. Some commentators feel things have gone too far. `` These treacheries marked the end of a certain idea which the British upper classes once entertained of themselves. But all that is over now. Its legacy, unfortunately, is increased cynicism and incipient paranoia,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> wrote in The Sunday Telegraph. Others ridiculed <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s notion that he was allowed to defect. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mates </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the defection caused much greater scandal than <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>'s arrest would have. <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> came in for some snide remarks. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> urged his colleagues to forget the traitors and not make `` journalistic pilgrimages to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' The Observer said his story was more appropriate for <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government daily, than a British newspaper. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Loynes </PERSON> of the media magazine <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> Press Gazette, however, said <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> had done `` the kind of thing every journalist dreams of.'' <PERSON> Knightley </PERSON> wrote: `` Why give publicity to a self-confessed traitor? Because unless we understand the motives and compulsions of <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> and his ilk, then we will have learned nothing from the affair.''

 Retailing magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>'s $ 6.6 billion takeover of the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> empire topped a surge in Canadian investment south of the border. The <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> deal last month was the largest Canadian takeover in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, who left his native <LOCATION> Sudbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, with an eighth grade education and retains a slight French-Canadian accent, it surpassed his $ 3.6 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Canadian investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has encompassed prime real estate from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, railways, pulp and paper mills, oil wells, telecommunications and many other industries. Here are some examples: _ The <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> brothers of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> _ control 8 percent of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s office space, including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Battery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, through their Olympic and <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> BCE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, is the second-largest telecommunications manufacturer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 14 <ORGANIZATION> Nortel </ORGANIZATION> plants and about 23,000 American employees. _ <ORGANIZATION> Imasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> owns the <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s fast-food chain and 830 <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> recently bought Tropicana orange juice from <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>; Canadians <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> publish dozens of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers; and the forestry and paper empires of <ORGANIZATION> Noranda </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> MacMillan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloedel </PERSON> extend across the border, as does the industrial might of <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminium </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> form the world's largest trading partnership, and a majority of the Fortune 500 companies long have operated above the 49th parallel. But until recently, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had been relegated to junior partner. As recently as 1975, direct Canadian investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stood at just $ 5.4 billion. By the end of 1986, however, this had soared to $ 29 billion, and the Canadian stake is now closer to $ 40 billion, according to Canadian government statistics. The 1986 figure compares with $ 55 billion worth of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the gap is closing. `` Over the past 10 years, Canadian investment in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is growing faster than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said business management professor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, a specialist in the topic. He cited 20 percent annual growth in Canadian investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 7 percent growth in the other direction. By the early 1990s, the amounts will be equal, he predicted. `` What's happened is that in the past 20 years the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> economy has matured, and our business sector has become world class.'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said 70 percent of Canada-U.S. trade is conducted by multinationals _ 22 based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 21 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ and 30 percent of the volume is from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, and their Canadian subsidiaries. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s overall share of investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> actually has declined from 20 percent to 8 percent in the past 12 years, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said, because Europeans and Japanese have been pouring dollar holdings back into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. Many of those foreign acquisitions have alarmed Americans, but the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> invasion has met little opposition. `` Canadian firms blend in so well they cause little hostility,'' said <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>. Flushed with success at netting <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> _ more than 650 stores in 15 chains, including the tony <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s _ <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` I consider myself a North American. What I like about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a more wide-open private enterprise system where there is less interference by government than there is in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' That will remain the case for Canadians under a bilateral Free Trade Agreement to take effect next January if ratified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Canadian investors will enjoy unfettered access in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment over $ 150 million will come in for scrutiny by <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Other attractions for Canadian investors include a market 10 times bigger and lower taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, 63, the youngest of seven children, runs his real estate and retailing empire from offices in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Father of six, he lives in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> with his second wife in a 11,000-square foot mansion with an Olympic-sized swimming pool. A personal friend of former Premier <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, a fellow French-Canadian, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> became the federal government's biggest landlord after building 40 percent of the government-occupied office space in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. `` He got too big for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said analyst <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigert </PERSON> of investment brokers <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 In deciding to pursue a new courtship with its oil-producing competitors, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is betting that such nations as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are ready for a historic shift in global oil relations. At stake is the future direction of oil prices, which have fallen steadily this year, partly due to increases in supply from non-OPEC nations. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> this week are inviting government representatives from at least seven independent oil-producing nations to meet with five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> keeps its headquarters, on April 23. All 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are to meet two days later. The invitation, announced by a committee of five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers on Saturday, is a clear acknowledgement by the cartel that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil supplies to keep prices up. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, said the cartel simply wanted to discuss `` methods of cooperation'' with non-OPEC producers. But the meeting probably will give rise to talks on oil production cuts intended to boost prices. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has an official target price for its oil of $ 18 a barrel, but little, if any, of its exports is fetching more than $ 15 a barrel. The loose association of oil-producing states has in past years been unable to prevent many of its own members from underselling. For much of the past six years, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has responded to declining prices and a buildup of surplus by cutting its production. Although this sometimes has provided a temporary boost to the market, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> over time has suffered an erosion both of prices and exports. The lower <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output has fallen, the less influence it has carried in the market and the more its poorer members, such as <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, have suffered. Now the cartel is hoping that the prospect of further decline in prices this year will move non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate by sharing the financial burden of restraining oil supplies. Oil production by non-OPEC nations has risen to 28 million barrels a day from 22 million a day in 1979. In that time, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output has tumbled from about 31 million barrels daily to 17.5 million <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has indicated it wants to improve cooperation in restraining oil supplies, but it is unclear how many other independent producers _ particularly the larger ones _ want to cut a deal with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest oil producer, is virtually certain to avoid any sort of cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, as is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, whose <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil makes it a major factor in the market. The world's No. 1 producer, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has shown little inclination to act in concert with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. Those that have expressed interest recently _ including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ are mostly small producers with little room to reduce their production. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> held meetings with representatives of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and several other smaller producers in a vain attempt to agree on joint production cuts. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was told that it must reduce its output first before the independents would consider a response in kind. Other independent producers include <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The problem for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> then and now is that some of its members _ notably cartel leader <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ simply do not want to continue the tactic of reducing production without firm pledges from producers outside <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. The Saudis, backed by their allies on the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, think it's more important to preserve their current share of world oil exports than to defend a fixed oil price most <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members ignore anyway. Even so, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has signaled that it is ready to make a fresh attempt to change global oil relations by drawing independent producers into an agreement. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> told reporters he saw an important difference between the current situation and that of two years ago. `` The major difference is that non-OPEC have, on their own, realized the need to cooperate ... and they have made approaches voluntarily ... to get together with us,'' he said. In this industry of maverick nations, however, many obstacles remain for an internally divided <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> trying to bridge differences with independents.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> won the Oscar as best actor Monday night for his role as a ruthless inside trader in `` Wall Street,'' while `` The Last Emperor,'' a tragic epic of modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, captured seven awards, including one for Italian director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>. Best supporting performers at the 60th annual Academy Awards were <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as the outspoken Italian mother with a wayward husband in `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, as the hard-fisted, incorruptible <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> beat cop in `` The Untouchables.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who also starred in last year's box-office smash `` Fatal Attraction,'' thanked his father, actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, for helping `` a son step out of his father's shadow.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' award was presented by <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, a deaf actress who won last year's Oscar. She has been taking speech lessons, and after signing her opening remarks she named all the nominees to prolonged cheers. `` Emperor'' had the most nominations with nine from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and picked up awards for direction, costumes, original score, art direction, cinematography, sound and editing. The sweeping story of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last imperial ruler had been widely favored to win the most honors, including best picture. `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' a jubilant Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> whooped after accepting the gold statuette. The reference was to her cousin, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s original <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, addressed his acceptance to the audience, his friends `` and a few enemies'' and put in a fervent plea for an end to the strike by movie and TV writers, which has stalled production and disrupted preparations for the Oscar show. The best original movie song of 1987 was `` The Time of My Life'' from `` Dirty Dancing.'' The actress category sparked the most interest this year, with many critics picking <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> for her role as a widow who discovers love in `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> was a strong contender, as was <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, as the faded Czech actress in `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' Also nominated were <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> for `` Broadcast News'' and two-time winner <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> for `` Ironweed.'' The first prize of the night, for best visual effects, went to `` Innerspace,'' a <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg-produced </PERSON> fantasy about a test pilot reduced to microscopic size and accidentally injected into the body of a grocery clerk. The award for best animated short film went to `` The Man Who Planted Trees.'' `` Young at Heart'' was best documentary short subject and `` The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit and Wisdom of the Algonquin Roundtable'' was best documentary feature. Best live action short film was `` Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall.'' More than 1,000 movie fans had packed bleachers hours in advance to cheer celebrities arriving at the Shrine Auditorium for the ceremonies, where much of the excitement focused on whether <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> would triumph as best actress. Many in the crowd wore shorts and T-shirts, ready for temperatures that rose into the 90s. But the most visible of the lot were seven 30ish women with teased blond hair. They carried rubber daggers and wore long white dresses with `` Fatal Attraction'' printed on the chest in red. One had come from <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, another from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` We're pulling for <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> to win,'' one of the women said in referring to the actress's nomination for her portrayal of the vengeful spurned lover in that movie. Comedian <PERSON> Chevy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> was host for the festivities, carried on live national television by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and also broadcast widely overseas.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 600 poor families made poorer by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political and economic crisis have taken over a stretch of seaside landfill and covered it with precarious shacks. The shanty town, a half mile from the ruins of the colonial city sacked and burned by pirate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> in 1671, has swollen rapidly since 60 families `` invaded'' the privately-owned land before dawn on March 25. Their takeover is a headache for the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and a dramatic example of the devastation the nation's crisis has wrought on the poor, most of whom lived hand-to-mouth even in the best of times. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the power behind the civilian government. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, hoping its action and months of civil unrest would oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Although the sanctions have bankrupted the nation's economy, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power. `` We were obliged by necessity to act,'' said <PERSON> Marcelino </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON>, one of five organizers of the takeover. Each of the squatter familes has staked out a 10-by-15 yard plot with rope, wire, ribbon or knotted strips of cloth. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON>, a 29-year-old unemployed tire salesman, lives with his wife <PERSON> Yadilia </PERSON> and their two infant children in a shanty made of mangrove poles, cardboard, a shower curtain, palm fronds and a sheet of corrugated zinc. It, like hundreds of other shacks spread over the seized 30 acres, is built on reclaimed land that until two years ago was a garbage dump. The indigent community is bordered by a foul-smelling tidewater tributary on which float bloated fish poisoned by raw sewage. Part of the camp was carved out of an auto graveyard. The rusted bodies and tattered interiors provide building materials, furnishings and a tetanus trap for the approximately 3,000 children living there. The dump has fostered a local population of raccoons, which have augmented the squatters' diet. Skins were tacked on the walls of several shacks. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON> said camp dwellers dig clams on the edge of their settlement and catch lizards and armadillos as well as the ring-tailed mammals. `` Nothing gets out of here alive,'' he said. `` Whack, and into the pot.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON> said a census shows about 570 families comprising almost 4,000 people lived in the camp as of April 4. They draw water from seven faucets along a dirt road bordering the camp, which sits off <LOCATION> Avenida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cincuentenario </LOCATION> about five miles east of downtown. <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anastasia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> stood around a smoky campfire in front of Ms. <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>'s shack. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> boiled in a blackened pot. `` Arroz ` pelado,''' -LRB- ` bald' rice -RRB-, she said disparagingly, using the slang for the grain unaccompanied by beans or meat. `` We do n't know what beans look like any more. This rice was donated by a nearby church. The three women, all on their own, have 11 children among them. They said many recent arrivals are single mothers. Ms. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> admitted to trying to steal a loaf of bread that morning from a nearby grocery, many of which are owned by immigrant Asians. `` The Chinaman almost took my head off,'' she said, exhibiting fingernail scratches streaking her neck. `` I know it's wrong, but my kids have to eat.'' Almost six weeks into the gravest political and economic crisis in Panamanian history, the women, like most others in the camp, are desperate. They have virtually no money, have been kicked out of the rooms they previously rented and see no prospects that things will soon improve enough to allow them to return to their menial or domestic jobs. They all cursed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Told that a newspaper supportive of the regime had dubbed the settlement `` Not One Step Backward'' _ <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s slogan in his battle with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ they all but spat their disgust. The land is owned by the <PERSON> Chanis </PERSON> family, a clan of doctors and statesmen prominent for several generations. They do not intend to sit by while it is requisitioned by the masses. `` The seizure took us by surprise,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanis </PERSON>. `` We await adequate action by authorities to correct the situation.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracia </PERSON>, whose family had been sharing his mother-in-law's two-room apartment with seven others, said he organized the takeover along with four friends with whom he regularly played volleyball `` In the first days, with just 60 families, we feared a move to dislodge us,'' he said. `` But the news circulated fast, and with the country the way it is, people poured in. It is another thing to disloge 570 families. They'd have to think twice about trying that.'' Any move against the squatters on behalf of the landowners would contradict official propaganda. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime portrays the crisis as a confrontation between good, underpriveleged and nationalistic Panamanians and bad, wealthy `` sell-outs'' conspiring with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to subjugate the isthmus.

 <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's license, expected to garner no more than $ 200, fetched $ 4,150 in the second day of bidding for items from the late pianist's five posh homes. `` It was probably the most personal item we sold,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Butterfield auction house. The amount bid includes the auctioneer's 10 percent commission. The person who bid for the license Sunday was a <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> fan who wanted to remain anonymous, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` There was a tremendous amount of interest in the license because of the picture, because of his signature and because of the very personal nature of it,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` Also because it was something that he daily used.'' About 2,500 people were present at the start of bidding Sunday. Total transactions for the day reached approximately $ 550,000, exceeding the $ 445,300 auctioneers expected. Saturday's transactions hit $ 660,045, higher than the projected $ 525,650 The auction ends Tuesday. King estimated that 25 percent of the crowd actually bid on items, which were bringing in four to five times their estimated value. `` And the flashier the clothing, the higher the bidding,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. A brown-and-white spotted cowhide evening jacket with brown trousers and matching cowhide shoes was expected to fetch up to $ 750 but was purchased for $ 3,125 by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the international auction house, organized the sale of 2,365 <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> items with <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Butterfield for the sale. Among the entertainer's treasures on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was a <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> grand piano, almost every surface of the instrument covered with mirrored squares, going for $ 46,750 to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, bought the first item Saturday, a pendant depicting <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s profile in sculpted silver against a blue lapis lazuli background, within a silver frame. It had been estimated to sell for up to $ 100. The <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>, who own a gem and jewelry show that tours the country, paid $ 3,850. `` He was a master showman,'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said. `` Not only were we fans, but there was nobody else like him.'' While many were bidders who purchased items as investments, many were fans who had come to pay their respects to Wladziu -LRB- Walter -RRB- <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, who died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS. He was 67. Proceeds of the auction will go to the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing and Creative Arts, which provides scholarships at 28 schools and colleges nationwide.

<HEAD>Theater Built By Coal Miners Opens As Fine Arts School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When this old mining town was booming with coal, men put aside their picks to construct a theater. Today, the miners are few but the structure still stands _ now as a school of performing arts. And as a proper salute to the people who worked underground in <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, organizers of the school have dedicated it to a famous coal miner's daughter, country singer <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. `` We want to help promote local talent,'' said artistic director <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>. `` We want to benefit the community. That's what we're here for, to benefit everyone in the arts.'' The three-story building, named the Miners Live Theater and completed in 1918 by members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 264 </ORGANIZATION>, was used for labor meetings and vaudeville shows. The theater's past is intertwined with the region's coal-mining history. According to literature about the building, the first mine in this town of 20,000 residents, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, was established in 1857. The industry led to the town's growth `` and by 1886 a man could walk underground through connecting tunnels between the mines from one edge of the city limits to the other,'' literature says. `` Mining and <LOCATION> Collinsville </LOCATION> were almost synonymous terms.'' The coal-mining industry slowly started to wane, however, and in 1969, Miners Live was sold to a private company, which turned it into a movie house. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> closed the 700-seat theater and it sat idle until February when <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> reopened it and decided to bring in live acts and launch a performing arts school and production company. The building still needs plenty of renovation. The seats have red strands of tape covering cracked vinyl upholstery. A walk up the stairs to the balcony shows walls with peeling paint. Elevated box seats flank each side of the stage and an orchestra pit is located in front. By starting the school and hiring big-name entertainers to perform at the site, Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> believes Miners Live will gain recognition. `` My gut feeling is that it's doing well already, that the sky's the limit,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said the fine arts school will feature instruction in dance, theater, modeling, singing, music, and playwriting. She has assembled a 25-member staff. So far, 50 students have signed up and classes could start this month at the <ORGANIZATION> Loretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, she said. `` It's going to be a launching pad for some professional careers _ hopefully,'' Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. The town is glad to see the doors reopen. Ms. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> was on hand April 1 for dedication ceremonies. `` It was part of <LOCATION> Collinsville </LOCATION> culture for so long,'' Ms. <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON> said. `` Most people think they have to go to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But like I said, there's nothing in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to compare with what's gon na' be happening here.''

 Clothes may make the man, but his tie can reveal his innermost secrets. The color, pattern and style of a man's necktie all provide clues to his personality and lifestyle, says the Guild of British Tiemakers, representing 30 manufacturers of `` the British tie,'' that sartorial symbol of the Old Boy Network. `` As eyes are reputedly the mirrors of the soul, so ties are the talisman of the image, a statement by the wearer of their personality and individuality, an indication of their temperament and mood, a symbol of the social set in which he does or wants to belong, a guide to how the wearer sees himself or would like others to see him,'' according to the guild's survey. To help tie wearers and watchers interpret some of the subtle messages, the guild has issued a guide to `` tiespeak.'' `` If you want to come across as a strong, confident extrovert person with strong opinions, choose a brilliantly colored tie or one with an exaggerated pattern or motif,'' it says. `` A man who wears a tie in a plain light color runs the danger of being a professional Mr. <PERSON> Nice </PERSON>, someone who likes to amuse and entertain, an arranger of matters rather than a doer.'' The `` more glowing'' the color of a tie, the more money-motivated the wearer is likely to be, the guide says. A plain dark tie, on the other hand, indicates a secretive man who keeps more than his tie close to his chest. The guide says a tie with light and dark stripes of equal width is the mark of a fence-sitter. Wide, light stripes on a dark background suggest the wearer thinks the best of people and accepts them at face value, while pessimists generally go for wide, dark stripes on a light background. Multicolored, multiwidth stripes indicate someone who'd love to do something daring _ if only he dared. A striped tie also can blurt out which side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> a man hails from. American tie stripes run from the right shoulder down toward the left, the opposite of those on a European tie. A tie with dark spots on a light background indicates `` a wheeler-dealer,'' while light spots on a dark background suggest `` a sheep in wolf's clothing,'' the guide says. `` Small, neat geometric patterns are taken to indicate a planner, a man who likes to create order out of chaos, probably a good administrator,'' it says. A small paisley pattern suggests an upholder of tradition, while a large paisly print suggests a hedger of bets. Ties give away other secrets. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a man's personal history can be traced through the ties in his closet, revealing his school, club and military background. Every British school has its own design, usually striped with the school colors, which every schoolboy wears as part of his uniform. Upon graduation he moves up to an `` Old School Tie,'' identifying his alma mater. He also may collect a regimental tie, with symbolic colors and crests. The colors of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>'s tie, for example, represent the ingredients of gunpowder _ yellow for sulphur, blue for saltpeter and black for carbon. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> tie represents the brown mud, red blood and green fields of <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION>, the World War I battlefield.

But the 51-year-old singer, who has his own show in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said a course of acupuncture cured him and set him back on the road with a new album and a British tour that starts this month. <PERSON> Humperdinck </PERSON> was quoted as saying he was dealing with `` a few'' lawsuits at the moment _ one price of success in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` People find it an easy thing just to sue you,'' he was quoted as saying. `` Lawyers do it on a percentage of the ` winnings.' They are ambulance chasers over there. `` That's the way they make their money _ off people who are successful, which is absolutely disgusting.''

 Folk singer <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> says he refuses to capitalize on the 12-year success of his self-produced album of children's music by endorsing toys and other kiddie products. `` I just believe that the music is important in and of itself. I do n't want its value to be diminished by doing commercial things that have nothing to do with music,'' <PERSON> Raffi </PERSON> said in an interview published Sunday in The Tennessean. `` Especially with children I have to be careful, because these children feel strongly about me and look up to me and it's so easy to exploit them in terms of what they want to be,'' he said. The former <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> coffeehouse singer's 1976 `` Singable Songs for the Very Young'' made him a favorite with the Sesame Street set. He's best known for such tunes as `` Bathtime,'' `` Shake Your Sillies Out'' and `` Rise and Shine.''

 Good day care is expensive for working parents, admits baby guru Dr. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spock </PERSON>, and he says government and industry are lagging in subsidizing child-care programs. `` There's no reason that the richest country should n't spend money -LRB- on day care -RRB- when they spend trillions of dollars on nuclear arms,'' <PERSON> Spock </PERSON> said at a forum Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Spock </PERSON>, 84, who wrote his first book about child care in the 1940s, said, `` I still emphasize the child's formative years, but I ca n't stop the tidal wave of women going to work. `` But there are things to mitigate it, to make it work out less harmful,'' he said, suggesting flexible hours and shorter work days as possible ways for parents to spend more time with their children.

 A 77-year-old <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> industrialist has been served with an arrest warrant in connection with <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s biggest postwar banking scandal, the 1982 collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>, Italian newspapers reported.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> sounded conciliatory notes Sunday as they campaigned for support in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential primary, a contest in which the active candidates often had to compete for attention with non-candidate <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. Meanwhile, the front-runner in the contest, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, took the day off to celebrate Greek Easter with his family. Also taking a day off was Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose path to the Republican presidential nomination is clear of serious opposition. While <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> remains in the race, the former television evangelist has conceded he has no chance to overcome <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long lead in the race. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> show `` Face the Nation,'' and played down their differences, which have appeared more heated as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign got under way. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said that if elected president he would not meet again with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He said a meeting he had with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> several years ago was `` for the sole purpose of challenging him to change his posture and move toward a mutual recognition policy with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' That meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has been a focus of criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaigned in heavily Jewish neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Sunday and received the endorsement of state Assemblyman <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON>, who told the crowd, many of them wearing the traditional black hats of the Hasidim: `` We want to understand when one of the candidates has embraced <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' At that, the crowd erupted into loud boos. <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON> described <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as `` the only one who has had the courage to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' He said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters were `` telling us we should reward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his silence.'' In his brief remarks to the crowd, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> steered clear of comment about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and told the crowd that in his years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have stood fast in support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> then took a walking tour for about 10 blocks down 13th Avenue, a street lined with kosher food shops and a variety of other small businesses. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said earlier in the week that Jewish voters and other supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would `` have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the primary. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had made one of the strongest direct attacks of the campaign on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when he said recently that the nation was looking for leadership not `` a preacher in the White House.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters bristled at the comment and called it racist. Asked if he agreed, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` That's not my basic position. There are race-based questions; his is not a race-based challenge and I accept it in that spirit, in part, because I respect <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> quite a bit as a person.'' When asked if he thought <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was being unfair, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also demurred. `` No, I think <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has too much character to be categorically unfair,'' he replied. While, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he had no intention of altering the aggressive tone of his campaign, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said he thought all the candidates `` have grown'' during the long debate. As for his approach to the campaign, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, `` I have no plans to change my basic campaign posture at all.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent Sunday morning preaching in the <LOCATION> Abyssinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, where he delivered a sermon called `` A Letter to Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>.'' He recounted the nation's progress since the civil rights leader's assassination 20 years ago, and said much remains to be done. He concluded quoting King's wish that all people would one day join hands and and sing: `` Free at last ... Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.'' Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he could not look up when he read the quote because there is still `` a lot of pain and passion in it all.'' `` All we can do is vow we will continue,'' he told reporters. `` It's not over.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had lunch at a soul food restaurant in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, and walked for several blocks through the neighborhood, hand in hand with his wife <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>. Residents called out to him and rushed up to shake his hand. People called down from their windows, `` Win, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>!'' and `` God bless you!'' as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> gave a thumbs-up sign. Security around <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was intense, with about 20 <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officers escorting him along the sidewalk, along with a phalanx of cameras. Limousines from the motorcade drove alongside. Later, in affluent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called for racial unity. ` Even lions and lambs ... do n't want the forest set on fire,'' he told a crowd in affluent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>. `` If lions and lambs can find common ground, then blacks and Jews, Hispanics and Italians can find common ground,'' he said to cheers from the largely black audience. A young white man waved a sign that said `` Jews want peace with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' The common ground in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as elsewhere in the nation, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, lies in economnic issues and the desire to rid the streets of drugs. Meanwhile, former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Meet the Press,'' commented on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> campaign, saying, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not been on the side of Jewish issues'' while all the other candidates `` ca n't wait but line up for those issues all the way down the line.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is `` appealing to those who are restless, despite prosperity. And that is what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must overcome, and that's why I think it's going to be a close election rather than a landslide.'' The former president, driven from office by the Watergate scandal, said that while he would describe <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` poets,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would better be compared to `` a word processor.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` he's cool, he's intelligent, he's tough, he's good in debates He's going to be a very formidable candidate.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor whom some Democrats have urged to get into the presidential race, took the spotlight from the active candidates on Saturday by announcing he would not endorse anyone prior to the April 19 vote and calling efforts to draft him `` unproductive and unwise.'' Did that end the possibility of drafting the governor? `` I've ruled it out,'' he said in a telephone call to The Associated Press. But spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said the governor meant that a draft should not take place, but was not ruling out acceptance of one if it did occur. On Sunday, however, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said `` I think it is absolutely a reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says it's wrong, it's counterproductive, it's unwise, it should n't be, then that means he rejects a draft.'' When asked if his remarks mean that he would not accept a draft, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, `` I think so.'' Former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON> said Sunday he will suspend his organized effort to draft <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> after receiving a letter from the governor requesting that he do so. He said, however, that if it appears there will be no front-runner at the Democratic convention, the effort would resume. `` It does n't change anything,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, responding to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s latest comment. `` I'm going to win <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, I'm going to win <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and I'm going to win the nomination,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor who had hoped to get <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s backing before the primary.

 An 18-day `` American Design'' exhibit staged at the Museum of Arts and Crafts drew 110,000 people, the highest number of spectators ever to attend a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exhibit in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The 250 artifacts presented were mostly everyday products ranging from household appliances to child-care items, from personal computers to farm tractors. A special unit dealt with objects of `` the motorized way of life'' and `` office work today.'' Exhibit manager <PERSON> Ursual </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the large turnout was due, in part, to heavy media coverage of the American product show, which closed Sunday. `` American Design'' will now travel to the cities of Miskolc in northern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for 18-day stints each.

 A bomb believed planted by Tamil extremists damaged the granite base of a statue of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, in the southern Indian city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. No one was reported injured in the blast on Sunday, the news agency said. There was no damage to the bronze statue of <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, unveiled by his grandson, Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, in December 1987. But chunks of granite were blown out of the base by the explosion. Police told the news agency they found two handbills signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> near the blast site. The group was linked to a bomb blast on a train in the southern Indian state of <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> in March 1987 that killed at least 22 people and injured 150. <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> is the capital of the state. Tamil speakers in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have long resisted efforts by the government to broaden the use of Hindi, the dominant language in the north.

 A new age of television promising sharper, brighter images on a larger, wider screen with sound as clean as compact disc recordings is making <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s TV broadcast insdustry excited and nervous. This new technology called high definition TV, or HDTV, is the biggest development in television since the introduction of color and many American TV station owners are eager to explore its potential. They also want to make sure they do n't get left behind. They are watching nervously as competing American interests work toward developing an HDTV transmission standard for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets while the Japanese and Europeans move independently with their own systems, neither of which is compatible with each other or with existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> TV sets. One of broadcasters' greatest fears is the probability that the Japanese, who plan to offer HDTV in their own country in 1990, will begin exporting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> HDTV receivers and video cassette recorders. Such packages could cut over-the-air broadcasters out of the video equation and threaten their survival. `` We do n't know how much time it will take'' to develop a system that can be used by over-the-air broadcasters, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which is developing a system that improves the TV picture though not as significantly as HDTV. `` We do n't know how the audience will react, and we do n't know how much time we have to develop our own HDTV.'' But one thing is certain, he said: `` We broadcasters will have competition by technically superior systems. `` We're fooling ourselves if we do n't think the people in the video cassette, cable and movie industries are going to take advantage of that,'' he warned in a panel discussion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention, which began Saturday and ends Tuesday. `` Broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if we take too long'' to meet the competition with an improved picture, he said. <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> is the most talked about development at this year's convention A room devoted to exhibits of the competing HDTV systems being developed as well as the Japanese system has provided most of the TV broadcasters here their first opportunity to see high definition television. The Japanese have been working on HDTV for nearly 20 years, and they are moving forward quickly. They plan to give a sneak preview of their system with broadcasts of this summer's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics to <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets in about 50 big-city department stores throughout the country. The quality of the picture on 35 - and 50-inch HDTV screens is noticeably better than on conventional TV sets The colors are brighter and the detail much greater. And because the width-to-height ratio can be greater, the picture has the panoramic appearance of a movie theater screen. The picture on a standard television set in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525 lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines. The Japanese system, however, requires more than the space allocated to TV channels on the electromagnetic spectrum. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the HDTV system called Hi-Vision will be transmitted by satellite to small rooftop antennas, avoiding the bandwidth problem that would be faced by over-the-air broadcasting. But special <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> receivers will be needed to see the enhanced picture. A large part of the debate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is whether a system can be developed that can compress into the standard 6 megahertz TV channel all the electronic information required to produce <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> pictures, or whether additional channel space on another band will be required. Some are advocating a transitional approach in which broadcasters would move first to a system that requires no extra bandwidth and is compatible with existing TV sets and produces an improved picture though not as good as HDTV. Whichever system is ultimately agreed upon by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, many technical questions must be answered and trade-offs examined. Meantime, many TV station executives are nervous. `` If you're not scared by HDTV, then you do n't understand the problem,'' said <PERSON> LeBon </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abercrombie </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> KMPH-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Within a few short years there are going to be high definition systems out there for home use in some fashion,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>, an engineer at <ORGANIZATION> KKTV-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` Broadcasters are most concerned about how that is going to erode their audience.''

 The world's largest tick collection could be headed for a climate-controlled pod in a museum because no one in the government wants to give the 1 million little blood-suckers a home. The Smithsonian Institution and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> ca n't agree on which one should pay the $ 200,000 necessary in fiscal 1989 to keep the government's Acarology Unit in business. The unit is home to 1 million tick specimens _ deceased, in case you were wondering or worrying _ that have been painstakingly collected by researchers over decades. If no agreement is reached by Sept. 30, the ticks will go into the museum equivalent of cold storage and the lab will be no more. It's not your typical tale of government cutbacks, but a potential tragedy nonetheless, according to entomologists and health officials who note the tick's role in carrying disease and the importance of research on the tiny, blood-sucking arachnids. `` The unit and the collection are unique, and are the backbone of tick research in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eickwort </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Acarological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter seeking help from Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. The funding dispute threatens a unique research program overseen by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> taxonomist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON>, who presides over the unit at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION>. Public health officials, veterinarians, armed forces physicians and zookeepers the world over know when they find a tick they ca n't identify, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON> is their man The unit's supporters describe it as the only place on the planet where researchers can send ticks for identification, critical to scientists trying to track the more than 20 tickborne diseases that plague humans: Common diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. More exotic diseases like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and <LOCATION> Kyasanur </LOCATION> forest disease. Other diseases that infect livestock and wild animals. Scientists and a group of congressmen have rallied to the unit's support, urging <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to save the lab for the good of the public health `` The collection and Dr. <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON> have been instrumental in the accurate identification of tick species which serve as vectors of disease, including the identification of a new species, Ixodes dammini, as the principal vector for transmitting Lyme disease,'' <PERSON> Eickwort </PERSON> wrote in his letter to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Suitland </LOCATION> laboratory was created in 1983 when <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> moved its tick collection from the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, to the Smithsonian. From 1984 to 1987, <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON> and his assistant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, received 14,113 tick specimens, most from agricultural and veterinary researchers. `` We have received them pinned, we have received them Scotch-taped, we have received them just dropped in an envelope,'' <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON> said during a recent tour of the spacious and orderly lab. The collection became the world's largest with the addition of the specimens, papers and books of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoogstraal </PERSON>, head of the zoology department at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> research unit in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for more than 35 years. <PERSON> Hoogstraal </PERSON> was the world's pre-eminent tick expert until his death in 1986. <PERSON> Keirans </PERSON> said the 1983 move came when <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> decided to get out of medical entomology, the study of insect-borne disease, and focus on AIDS research. <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the salaries of <LOCATION> Keirans </LOCATION> and a technician for two years; when the agreement expired, it was extended to September 1988. But NIH is no longer interested in having a medical entomologist housed at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> said the museum tried to raise funds for the tick unit, but never said it would pay for the facility and never felt there was `` some deadline where we would take over the staff salaries.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMontagne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>'s director of microbiology and infectious disease program, sees it differently. He said institute officials felt that the ticks belonged at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, and `` the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> originally said that they were interested in it.'' `` It's my understanding now that their assessment of it now is not quite in line with that. I think they get uncomfortable with the public health and service kind of needs that the collection implies.'' <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> officials appointed 11 researchers familiar with the lab to consider the issue. In March, they concluded that the unit should be funded by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, with the <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION> continuing to provide space and equipment. <PERSON> LaMontagne </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> is looking into several options: financial support from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, both heavy users of the unit's taxonomy service; or some fiscal legerdemain, which would move the unit's funding to another part of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> budget. Twenty-two federal legislators, led by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, wrote last month to <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, urging <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> to continue funding the lab. <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> district has high incidences of Lyme disease, which causes temporary paralysis, and tick-borne babesiosis -LRB- a malaria-like fever -RRB- has become one of the tick program's biggest boosters. He says that if <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> does n't want the tick program, someone else should give it a home. `` I do n't really care where they stay,'' he said.

<HEAD>HUD Announces Housing Discrimination Survey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal housing officials today announced plans to find out how many black and Hispanic couples are victims of `` racial steering'' or other discriminatory treatment in their search for places to live. The first major study of housing discrimination in a decade would use hundreds of white, black and Hispanic couples as bogus house-hunters to test the nation's metropolitan rental and real estate markets. `` Racial steering'' occurs when agents steer minorities away from all-white residential areas. `` Despite advances in civil rights, discrimination still exists, in more subtle ways than before, in many areas,'' said Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in requesting bids to conduct the study. The deadline for bidding is May 26, with the study expected to be completed in mid-1990. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said the aim is to increase enforcement against illegal discrimination. Other officials said the study also could determine the need for stronger fair-housing legislation. The last such study, completed in 1979, used 600 black and white couples who tried to buy or rent homes or apartments in 40 metropolitan areas across the country. It included couples with nearly identical backgrounds, except for race, who would respond to the same newspaper ads and then fill out detailed forms reporting their experiences. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary for policy development and research, said in an interview that the new study will use similar methods. The 1979 study estimated that 27 percent of rental agents and 15 percent of house sellers discriminated against blacks. Discrimination then was defined as `` failing to provide important, necessary information to rent or purchase a home.'' The study concluded that black home buyers who inquired about four different advertised homes had a 48 percent chance of finding discrimination in dealing with at least one of them. In the rental market, 85 percent found discrimination in at least one of four inquiries about apartments. <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> said the new study will be expanded to include more-subtle discrimination, differences between discrimination in cities and suburbs, and discrimination against <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> as well as blacks. There is no plan to include <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>, native American or other minorities, he said. Since the Fair Housing Assistance Program began in 1983, discrimination claims have declined from about 5,000 complaints a year to about 4,500 annualy, <PERSON> McRae </PERSON> said. The new study, he said, is needed to determine whether that decline is significant. `` We hope this research will document the existence of housing discrimination in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, or lack of discrimination _ whatever the case may be,'' <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> said. The only broad-based studies of discrimination in recent years have relied on census data rather than the actual experiences of people seeking to buy or rent living space, he said. A study by <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> sociology professor, concluded last year that most blacks still live in segregated neighborhoods while <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and Hispanic minorities have had more success moving into largely white neighborhoods. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> analyzed census date from 1970 and 1980. Last June, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials pledging that its 750,000 members around the nation would provide equal access to housing regardless of race.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who saw his long-shot White House ambitions curdle over the course of 24 hours last week, handled the disappointment with a statesmanlike equanimity that could ease the Democrats' path toward an autumn unity. Now _ win, lose or draw _ <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will set his 1988 legacy in the eight days before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary. The senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> recently voiced some shrill criticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and party leaders have asked him to stop before things get ugly. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> began his negative campaign after suffering a string of miserable defeats, suggesting to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and others that he was acting out of desperation. Desperation politics, as we have seen previously this year, is not generally a pretty sight to behold. Take <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. For one marvelous week of February, he boasted a positive message and a priestly visage and looked for all the world like a Republican giant-killer. The roof caved in in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and before the clock struck midnight, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> struck out at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Within days he was on the air with anti-Bush `` attack ads.'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had no real chance to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination but when his support dissipated, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> nonetheless took it out on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In one of the more amazing accusations of the year, he suggested without proof that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign had leaked word of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s immorality so as to hurt <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> at the polls. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has apparently chosen a more cool-headed course. Following his back-to-back defeats last week In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> kept to the high road, revealing no rancor and making unmistakable gestures to Jewish voters whose suspicions were kindled by the `` Hymietown'' and <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> episodes of 1984. He likes to mock <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the man with money but no message, but they agree on many issues and the barbs rarely have gotten more biting than that. Despite insistent baiting from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> -LRB- who said a Jew would have to be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has kept his serenity. `` We are already in a tender situation,'' he said of black-Jewish relations. `` Responsible leadership must move to heal people and not to extend their fears.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> allowed a surrogate _ <PERSON> Brooklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON>, whose endorsement he had just received _ to attack <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. With the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator at his side, <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON> brought up <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, and praised <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as the only candidate `` who has had the courage'' to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Later in the day, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s statement that if elected president, he would not meet again with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, however, couched his approval in terms that called attention to the earlier meeting, calling that a change in position for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s steady 1988 demeanor has won many admirers. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> calls him a `` poet,'' and `` one of the very best -LRB- candidates -RRB- of the entire century for either party.'' `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has certainly has been a good force in our time,'' says prominent Democratic economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>. `` He has given voice to people who previously did not have voice and is bringing a whole group of new people into the political process.'' Now, Democratic eyes are on <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. It caught party leaders by surprise to see <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> _ so quiet throughout the primary season _ turn up the heat on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In the days before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> landslide, ranking Democrats were content to let nature take its course. Now they are telling <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to pull back. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s people counter that his campaign is doing just what campaigns were always intended to do: point out the differences between his priorities, policies, and record and those of his opponents. `` Nothing personal,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> said late last week. <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> is basically correct. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> taunts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for lacking foreign policy experience and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for having no experience in office at all. It's pretty tame stuff, but it defies the current catechism of the party establishment, which is this: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is too liberal, too inexperienced -LRB- and maybe too black -RRB- to beat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, among others, both had a chance to beat him and thank heaven <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has done it. Now it's time to quiet down, deliver the nomination to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and get on with party unity _ with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both needed to build bridges across the South. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> obviously wants one more chance to emerge as the alternative to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. If the attacks and $ 1 million worth of TV time are working, he'll likely keep it up. But if he does n't see a quick improvement in the pre-election polls, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will probably tone down the rhetoric this week and go softly unto the night. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, just turned 40, is generally thought to be looking ahead at 1992 and beyond _ so common sense says he wo n't want to leave a bad taste in anybody's mouth.

<TEXT>
 Every two hours or so on a normal working day, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> goes to a wooden board on the wall of his office and posts the latest crop prices at the grain elevator back home in <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, R-Kan., is a one-issue congressman: `` The whole thing is agriculture,'' says press secretary <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zillinger </PERSON>, gesturing matter-of-factly to an office festooned with pictures of wheat-growing country and toy models of tractors Only a few steps down the hall are the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing rooms. Handy, since <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> haunts the committee more than most lawmakers. `` The allegation that I'm a one-issue congressman, or a full-time aggie, has at least some bearing in fact,'' says <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who represents the western two-thirds of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, a vast wheat factory sometimes called <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. He has steadily gathered seniority and is now viewed as a force to be reckoned with, especially in view of rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on farm exports. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has pushed hard for a so-called triggered marketing loan for wheat, feed grains and oilseeds, which could boost exports but at a $ 500 million price tag. The plan, part of a sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill, figures to be in the spotlight again as the measure heads for final floor action, perhaps as early as next week. Meanwhile, the drive has furnished a showcase for the rhetorical flourish that <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has brought to the panel. At one point, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told wary budget watchdogs that the subsidy would amount to nothing more than a bargaining chip in international trade talks, never go into effect and thus cost taxpayers nothing. `` We're not asking you to take her home,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're just asking you to dance with her. Then at closing time you can sneak out the back door.'' The crack was typical of the Roberts flair for daubing color on an otherwise gray farm debate. One steamy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> night last summer, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chairman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garza </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, tried to ease a farm credit bill through the panel without long debate. Some lawmakers suggested he was attempting to `` railroad'' the measure. That put <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> in mind of a desperado band that once roamed the high plains of western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` I'm from <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>,'' he declared. `` Out there we stop trains to see what's in'em before we let'em through.'' Another <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> remark mirrored farm frustration in the early 1980s when rural debt was skyrocketing and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was taking a cautious approach to increases in federal payment programs. Air Force One, declared <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, had better not fly too low over <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> or it was liable to get `` a pitchfork in the belly.'' A Marine Corps veteran with bald dome and granite features, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> launches his barbs in flat <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> accents bearing a marked resemblance to those of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ who once represented <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' 1st District. `` There's a lot of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in his style,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., top Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Pat's an old pro. I do n't think anyone around here knows farm programs any better than he does.'' `` He has some of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s incessant desire to be cute and to make his point in a hard-biting kind of way,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> long has been a thorn to environmentalists He sponsored a plan urged by food processors to bar states from setting pesticide regulations tougher than those of the federal government. He also fought for exemptions to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s sodbuster program designed to curb soil erosion. Those same environmentalists say, however, that it is hard to stay mad at him. `` It's nifty to find someone in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> like him who does n't hold grudges because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is full of grudges,'' says <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist She says that once when an Agriculture Committee aide barred her from a hearing on grounds the room was full, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> put aside their numerous past skirmishes and ordered: `` Let her in.'' `` Otherwise I'll have to lie and say she's on my staff,'' he chortled.

 How many days a week do you practice basketball, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> demanded of the young player prodded to his feet in the packed high school auditorium. `` Four to six,'' was the reply. `` When you come home at night do you study for four hours? ... Three hours? ... Two hours?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked. The other kids were giggling now, and eventually the boy admitted to `` maybe'' one hour of studying, with radio on and occasional calls to his girlfriend. That brought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to one of his favorite lectures, on the opportunities that await those who study hard, the importance of pushing for all that life holds, of working to rise above less-than-privileged beginnings. Included is a pointed anti-drug and anti-alcohol message that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been hammering home for years to youngsters at schools across the country. `` What does it matter if opportunity is there ... if you're to drunk to stagger through the door?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked. `` What does it matter if your classmate is black or white if you ca n't get along with anybody?'' The motivational talk is not part of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s regular campaign pitch, but talking to high school students is part of his campaign schedule, as it has been a big part of his lecture tours in the past. And fighting drugs is a big part of his campaign message. In talking to the young people, he always includes a dramatic series of questions: How many people here know someone who has died because of drugs? Please stand. A smattering always stand up. How many know someone who is in jail because of drugs? This sometimes brings about half the audience to its feet. How many know someone who has tried drugs? Virtually the entire audience stands. And then <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asks, `` How many know someone who has contemplated suicide?'' As many as half will stand. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for action against drug use and trafficking gets a more enthusiastic response than almost anything else he talks about on the campaign trail. Lately the candidate has needled his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponents, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying they are following his leadership by making drugs a bigger part of their own campaign messages. ` We've never known a threat quite like drugs,'' he told some 4,000 people at <ORGANIZATION> Iona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Sunday. In the old days, black people were threatened by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> who came at night wearing hoods and carrying lynching ropes, he said. But now, `` We've lost more lives to dope than to the rope.'' The audience cheered when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added his punch line: `` Those who push drugs do n't wear hoods _ they are hoods.'' His standard talk to the high school kids is about more than just drugs _ it's about self-motivation and the chance to excel in life. At <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION> High, he told the youths that they are good athletes because, ` You do well what you do much. There's nothing wrong with your mind. There's something wrong with your time. ... I challenge you to use your mind. I challenge you to study. Give your mind a chance. `` As I travel around the country, the rising use of drugs and babies making babies and suicide is undermining our opportunity,'' he said. He typically ends up leading a chant: `` Down with dope, up with hope. Down with dope, up with hope.'' The kids, chanting `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' mobbed him Sunday as he left the stage. `` He touched my hand,'' squealed <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 17. What did she and her friend think of his talk? `` It was very inspirational,'' one of them said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had zeroed in on the problems of their world, especially the `` down with dope, up with hope,'' and the part about `` babies making babies.'' `` That's the problem right here in this school,'' said <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s $ 27 million movie turkey `` Leonard Part 6'' gobbled up three Golden Raspberry Awards to lead the flock in the eighth-annual Oscar Eve parody poking fun at the year's worst in film. `` Leonard,'' which was disowned by <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, captured worst-trophies in picture, screenplay and actor categories from the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation. The Razzie award ceremony Sunday night, 22 hours before the Academy Awards show was to start, was held at the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, the site of the first Oscar show 60 years ago. Pop star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> captured her second Razzie crown as Worst Actress, this time for her performance in `` Who's That Girl?'' <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>'s Razzie stock dropped with the 175-member foundation who voted her Worst Supporting Actress for her role in `` Wall Street.'' Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actor awards went to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendenhall </PERSON> for his role as what the foundation described as the `` insufferably whiney son'' of muscle-man <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> in the arm-wrestling melodrama `` Over the Top.'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, who directed the $ 35 million mega-bomb `` Ishtar,'' tied for Worst Director with author-director <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> for his `` Tough Guys Do n't Dance'' murder mystery. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> the shark splashed to victory in the new Worst Special Visual Effects and Creature Creations category for his gut-wrenching portrayal of the toothy killer in `` Jaws: The Revenge.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who starred in all four `` Jaws'' sagas, also got his teeth into this year's `` Worst Career Achievement Award.'' The foundation termed it's winner in the Worst Song competition an `` over-heated obvious ditty.'' `` I Want Your Sex!'' written by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, was from `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II.'' Winners, if they dare to show up for the ceremony, receive a trophy of a golf-ball size raspberry glued atop a film reel and spray-painted with gold. The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation consists of film professionals and critics, as well as frequent film-goers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and nine other states. `` There are three basic theories of what qualifies as a Razzie,'' explained <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, foundation president. `` First, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s own measure, how much money did it lose? Second, a movie that was not supposed to be a comedy that generated enormous laughs from the audience. ` Jaws' was one of those and so was <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON>'s ` Tough Guys Do n't Dance,' which was laughed off the screen in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. `` The last is how excruciating it is to actually sit through a film. Does someone have to pay you money or bribe you with popcorn? ` Who's that Girl?' fits into that category,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Crops, Livestock Balance Seen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the effects of this year's continued improvement in the farm economy may be a closer balance between the crop and livestock sectors, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist. For some time <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists have been forecasting that 1988 net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion. Last year, with a bulge in livestock profits, net cash income rose to a record $ 57 billion _ the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says 1988 crop receipts may rise 8 percent to 14 percent from last year's $ 59 billion to a range of $ 64 billion to $ 67 billion. Livestock receipts, which were a record of $ 74 billion in 1987, may decline to between $ 71 billion and $ 74 billion. `` While cattle receipts will be the second or third highest on record, hog and dairy receipts may each fall nearly $ 1 billion,'' he said. `` Substantial increases in supplies could bring hog prices down by one-sixth from last year, and poultry prices one-fourth below two years ago.'' Meanwhile, farm expenses will end their downward trend of the last few years. Feed and fertilizer prices may rise 6 percent to 7 percent in 1988, translating into $ 2 billion of added costs. Repairs, energy and labor could add another $ 1 billion, while interest and livestock purchase may decline by about $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, writing in the April issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said 1988 will bring `` continued improvement in the farm sector's balance sheet.'' A slight strengthening of land prices and a reduction in farm debt of $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion will boost farmers' equity by $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion. `` The combination of higher crop prices, lower hog and poultry prices, and higher feed costs is shifting profits from livestock to crop producers,'' he said. Other impacts of higher crop prices, according to <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, include: _ The turnaround in declining land values coincided with a rise in corn and soybean prices during the first six months of 1987 _ With higher crop prices and the related strengthening in land values, crop farmers have seen larger cash flows and a stabilization of loan security, or collateral, provided by real estate assets `` All regions, including the economically hard-hit <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, are likely to have less farm financial stress in 1988,'' he said. `` Roughly 60 percent of loan default problems of commercial farmers were on primarily crop-producing farms at the start of 1987.'' _ Capital expenditures are picking up as cash flows improve and there is confidence in long-run profit potential In 1988, capital spending may increase by as much as $ 1 billion, with spending for tractors and combines leading the list. _ Government spending on crop supports are easing as commodity prices increase Direct government payments may decline 16 percent to 20 percent this year to between $ 13 billion and $ 15 billion.

 When it comes to clothing, it turns out that single men buy more than single women. But they're buying a lot of it for the women, not themselves, researchers have found. Men also spend more than women on eating out, entertainment, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and cars. Single women, on the other hand, spend more of their income on housing, food eaten at home, health care and reading material. Those are among the findings reported in the April edition of American Demographics magazine. While the study of spending by single people reported that the males spend more on clothing _ on average _ the difference rests entirely with men aged 55 to 64. `` Men aged 55 to 64 spent $ 1,128 a year on apparel and services in 1984-85, compared with the $ 682 a year spent by the women in that group,'' reported <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>. `` Much of that difference can be accounted for by men's purchasing of apparel as gifts Almost 25 percent of the apparel budget of men goes toward gifts, compared with 14 percent of the apparel budget of women,'' she wrote. `` More than half of the men's apparel gift purchases are for jewelry and watches _ and women are the likely recipients of many of those gifts,'' reported <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>. Women outspent men on apparel in all other age groups, but the one deviation was enough to pull average clothing spending for all single men above that of single women, $ 735 to $ 657, she found. <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> heads the analysis branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>' division of consumer expenditure surveys. Her report is based on a study of spending by singles in 1984 and 1985. American Demographics, published by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Company, concentrates on population and marketing. While women have made gains in recent years they continue to trail men in income at all age groups, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> noted. Thus, while women may spend less than men on some items, that money may still represent a larger share of their resources than for males. Single men are more likely to be younger, under age 35, while single women were more often aged 55 and over, she found. Single women were more likely to own their own home, 41 percent, compared to 29 percent of men, likely reflecting their older age as a group. Single men were found to devote 20 percent of their money to cars, car repairs and other transportation costs, while women spent 17 percent of their income on transport. After age 55, however, women tended to spend slightly more than men on new cars and trucks, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> discovered. Single women spent twice as much as men on health care, and that was not just because they tended to be older. Younger women also spend more on health than men in their age group. At every age group men outspent women on entertainment, `` perhaps because it is still the custom that men pay for dates,'' <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Finance Ministers from 151 Nations Meeting in US</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a change, there's no aura of crisis hanging over this week's meetings of finance officials from 151 nations, a welcome development given the doomsday scenarios which sprang up following the stock market collapse last October. The delegates to the spring meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will be wrestling with the long-standing problems of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances as preliminary discussions get underway today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But six months ago, many economists were predicting that the finance leaders would be facing the far more troubling prospect of a global recession, triggered by the stock market plunge. Instead, the world economy is growing at a faster rate than expected, inflation is remaining subdued and the stock markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have regained much of the ground lost last fall. For this reason, analysts are n't expecting any major policy changes to come out of the meeting Wednesday between <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his counterparts from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the mastermind behind some of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's most successful economic initiatives, is likely to urge a do n't - rock-the-boat approach that will keep things on an even keel through the In a speech last week, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> boasted that `` significant progress'' had been made by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies in promoting economic cooperation. `` The seven largest industrial nations in the free world now have a coordination process firmly in place,'' he said. This will be the first meeting of the so-called Group of Seven since last September. At that time, unity and international economic cooperation were also the watchwords. But behind-the-scenes disagreements between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over interest rates became public soon after the meeting, unnerving investors and, many believe, contributing to the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. The market collapse served as a strong reminder to finance leaders of the dangers in disharmony and on Dec. 22 they pledged to support the dollar at its current levels. They then backed that pledge up by intervening in currency markets, the process by which governments buy and sell currencies to influence their value. Since early this year, the dollar has stabilized and the top industrial countries are expected to pledge anew this week to support that stability. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is also likely to push again for the other countries to adopt his idea of using an index of commodity prices, including gold, as one of indicators the countries use to measure the impact of their policies. But some have been skeptical, wondering if the proposal might be the first step to moving the world back to a gold standard for currencies, something that was abandoned in 1973 when the current floating exchange rates were implemented. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> denies that, saying the commodity index would merely serve as a useful measure of inflationary pressures. On Third World debt, the finance ministers are expected to basically reaffirm existing strategies although they may adopt some new approaches aimed at cutting the trillion-dollar debt burden. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, has taken the position that the burden on heavily indebted countries is becoming unsustainable and such initiatives as the recent Mexican debt-for-bonds swap are needed if the debt crisis is ever to be resolved. In that case, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> offered to exchange debt held by commerical banks in return for a reduced amount of Mexican bonds which were backed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury securities. For his part, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has also endorsed efforts to find new ways of reducing the debt burden but he has opposed any broad debt-relief plans involving the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, contending they would be too costly and would represent a bailout for big commercial banks.

 The `` American Focus'' radio show and the college students who produce it are hardly household names, but the guests heard on the program usually are. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> are among the hundreds of luminaries who have agreed to sit behind the mike. The show, one of the country's largest nationally syndicated public affairs radio programs, is the work of 30 <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who have virtually no formal radio training and put the show together in their spare time. Even radio professionals are surprised when they learn the show is just a student activity. `` It's very professionally done. I did n't know they were students. They sounded like they have been in the field for quite some time,'' said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cort </PERSON>, public affairs coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> WRKS-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which broadcasts the program. The weekly, half-hour show features one guest and three to four student interviewers. It boasts a network of 270 stations, including outlets in all of the nation's 50 largest radio markets. For the most part the show is broadcast either Sunday morning or night, the time slots to which most public affairs programs are relegated. The show is geared to adults, not college students. The program is not even heard on college radio stations. `` For the most part our audience is not our peers. It's primarily adults,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a junior who's executive `` Rock stars ... we just do n't think that's what our audience will appreciate. When we do entertainers we go for the more established entertainers.'' Because a show may not be broadcast until three weeks after taping, `` American Focus'' does n't try to break news. It focuses on the guest's view of the news and `` a little bit about the person, their lives and things that have led them into what they are doing,'' said the show's current president, junior <PERSON> Sofia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. But the show has made some headlines. Several years ago, actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> admitted while on `` American Focus'' that he had used drugs. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> also said he stopped using them after he was charged with possessing narcotics following a traffic accident. A blown-up copy of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times story crediting `` American Focus'' with the scoop hangs in the show's offices in a creeky old house on the <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> campus. `` Sometimes, the guests, if they know we are college students, they wo n't put up as much as a front than if we were professionals,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. The show was founded in 1974 by a local high school student who pieced the initial programs together `` with scotch tape and stuff,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. The first show, with a relatively anonymous <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> official as the guest, could only be heard on a <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> radio station. When the student, <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancier </PERSON>, now an executive at <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, was accepted to <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, he bought the show with him, initially producing it out of his dormitory room. Today the show still does n't receive direct financial support from the university, but it now has commercial sponsors who help pay its annual budget of $ 40,000 to $ 50,000. Money left over is put back into the program because the enterprise is non-profit.

Tuesday night, party regulars are scheduled to attend Democratic and Republican meetings to pick individuals to proceed to future gatherings where delegates to the parties' national conventions in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> will be selected. Because <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> had a presidential primary, the number of delegates each presidential candidate will receive already has been determined. So Tuesday night's caucuses will really be a matter of just picking the individuals to represent the candidates. `` There's no reason to try to raid the caucuses,'' said Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Harriett </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, the Democrats' top elected official in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` Everybody seems to be magnanimous,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Feather </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's no real animosity.'' Tuesday night's mass meetings are the first of several steps over the next two months that will determine which Missourians will go to the conventions this summer where the two presidential nominees will be picked.

 Six 24-foot fiberglass Oscars stood guard today outside the Shrine Auditorium, flanked by dozens of fans camped out in bleachers for a front-row look at celebrities arriving for the 60th annual Academy Awards. `` This is my ninth year being first, and 11th overall. I'm having a great time,'' bragged <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, slurping on a frozen ice bar as temperatures soared to 93 degrees Sunday afternoon With about 100 fans already grabbing seats outside Sunday to catch a glimpse at the glitz, inside, technicians fine-tuned reluctant dragons and participants rehearsed. Tonight's three-hour show is to be broadcast nationally by <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> starting at 9 p.m. EDT. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s `` The Last Emperor,'' the kind of historical epic <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> loves to embrace, was favored for best picture over `` Broadcast News,'' `` Moonstruck,'' `` Fatal Attraction'' and `` Hope and Glory.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and Meryl Streep were in contention for best actress. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were in a best actor battle with <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. During rehearsals Saturday, <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> worked their way through an introductory duet introducing a medley of Oscar-nominated best songs, with <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> playing a white concert grand piano. The first song, `` Storybook Love,'' got under way with a silhouette sequence featuring a prince who was supposed to take on enemies and slay a dragon as they slipped past him on a treadmill. But as <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVille </PERSON> moved through his tune, the dancer-prince stood with nothing approaching. A disembodied stage manager's voice shouted, `` OK, we have an emergency stop. Please stop. ... Our dragon hung up.'' `` Of course it has hang-ups. That's why they call it a drag-on,'' quipped DeVille. Dragon fixed, the sequence continued with a female dancer on guy wires gracefully descending to the arms of her waiting prince until she bumped into a passing castle. The auditorium, which features distinctive twin turnip-top domes and filigreed cornices and arches, seats 6,308, twice as many as the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which had been the Oscars' home for years. Red carpeting lined the entrance where Oscar nominees, studio chiefs and others will file through tonight. Fans began arriving before dawn on Sunday, bringing ice chests, sleeping bags, plenty of cold drinks and hats. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> residents <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, grabbed a corner spot of the bleachers. The Hernandezes and their niece found seating after officials turned them away Friday and Saturday because the bleachers were unfinished. `` They said come back at 7 p.m. on Sunday, but we came early on a hunch and they -LRB- would -RRB- let us in,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. In all, winners of 22 awards were to be announced tonight. Three already were announced, the <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> lifetime achievement award for director <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. In the actress category, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was nominated for her `` Moonstruck'' role, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> for `` Broadcast News,'' Close for `` Fatal Attraction,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> for `` Anna'' and Streep for `` Ironweed.'' In the actor category, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was nominated for his `` Wall Street'' role, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> for `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mastroianni </PERSON> for `` Dark Eyes,'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> for `` Ironweed'' and Hurt for `` Broadcast News.'' The supporting performance categories include <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON> for `` Gaby,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> for `` Fatal Attraction,'' <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for `` Moonstruck,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> for `` Throw Momma from the Train,'' and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sothern </PERSON> for `` The Whales of August.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Zaccaro Drug Case Was More Than Possession</HEAD>

 A prosecutor says he refused to reduce a felony charge against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> because `` there was plenty of evidence'' that the son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was selling cocaine. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said she and her candidacy were partly to blame for her son's conviction Saturday, but blasted <ORGANIZATION> Addison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> for failing to accept a plea bargain <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said he was reluctant because of the problem of drugs in society. `` I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37 marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced that. But as time goes on I feel more strongly about drug cases,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said Sunday. `` I just think it's becoming more of a problem in the country and we need to deter that.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24, was convicted of selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover officer at his off-campus apartment on Feb. 20, 1986. He was a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at the time. No sentencing date has been set. The felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $ 10,000 fine. At a news conference after the verdict, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said the family would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` We still believe he was set up,'' she said. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> blamed her son for possession of cocaine, as well as herself `` and my candidacy for making my son a target.'' She was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984. But she said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> prolonged `` the agony for two years'' by not allowing <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> to plead to a lesser count of cocaine possession. `` We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to the felony charge of selling cocaine, <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. `` To me it was clearly a selling case,'' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who said the family first approached him about a pea agreement at <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s arraignment `` There was plenty of evidence he was selling. I never considered a possession case and they know that.'' He added, `` If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge, that's her prerogative. I did n't feel there was any justification for reducing the charge.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s defense lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetzlaff </PERSON>, had argued that his client was entrapped by a young, inexperienced, attractive female undercover police officer. `` This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct,'' he told jurors. But <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> called <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> a well-organized drug dealer, and said he was known on campus as `` The Pharmacist'' because of his reputation as a dealer. After <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s arrest, <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> officials formed a task force to look at the campus drug problem. After more than a dozen meetings, it made 20 recommendations, most of which were implemented by college trustees. They included the hiring of a health educator, publication of a drug brochure, additional security staff, and improved relations with the <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> police. Most <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> students questioned about the case said the outcome did not concern them. `` My sophomore year it was more interesting. But now, half the people on campus were n't even here,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woithe </PERSON>, a senior from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 Jewish settlers rejected an army report saying an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager was killed by a settler's gun and demanded harsh punishment for a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village where they claim the girl was slain by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>. In another development, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders on Sunday called for a commercial strike today in the occupied lands and demanded the resignation of Arabs holding appointed or elected positions in the territories. The occupied territories were quiet on Sunday. Arab reports said troops closed shops and food markets in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which opened during morning hours. Since Palestinians began violent protests against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in early December, 141 Arabs, one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and one Israeli civilian have been killed. The Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators, including some from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, on Sunday condemned the army after its report on the death of the teen-ager and demanded its chief of staff resign. They urged tough sanctions on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rioters, including the expulsion of Arab stone-throwers, and called for the destruction of every home in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village where 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was killed on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> quoted the army report as saying Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was accidentally killed by the M-16 rifle of Roman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>, a settler-guard who `` panicked and opened fire in all directions'' during the clash with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioters. Besides Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, two <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> died in the melee, and 15 people, including 13 Jewish teen-agers and two Arabs, were wounded. Outraged settlers insisted Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was shot with a rifle by a masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and charged the Jewish teen-agers involved were not properly questioned. The army said it has destroyed 13 houses belonging to inciters of last week's clash and killed a 14-year-old Arab who tried to avoid arrest. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has barred the army from destroying any more homes in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> pending an appeal from a civil rights group. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> reported on Sunday that 150 villagers have been detained, of whom 30 remained in custody. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, presented the army's version of the clash to the Cabinet on Sunday. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said an army autopsy showed Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> apparently was shot by a bullet from <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>'s rifle, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> and another adult settler were guarding the Jewish teen-agers during a hike. A senior army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the fatal bullet came from <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>'s weapon, but said the army had not yet determined who fired the shot. The hikers said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON> only fired a single shot in the air while the group was inside <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>. `` I looked up and saw an Arab man with a masked face shooting a -LRB- rifle -RRB- from a rooftop,'' said <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Avivi </PERSON>, a hiker. <PERSON> Geulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a legislator from the nationalistic <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, demanded that <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> resign. `` I think he simply failed. He jumped to conclusions and, acting as a judge, pointed an accusing finger at the settlers,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The TV quoted <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s trade and industry minister, <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, as telling the Cabinet that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> who attacked the youths should be expelled, their homes destroyed and a new Jewish settlement established nearby. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, defended the army. `` Cabinet ministers are not investigators and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> is not a judge. This should be left to competent authorities,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> called for `` unity between all parts of the people ... for the good of the people and, first of all, for the security of the people.'' A Palestinian leaflet distributed on Sunday in the occupied lands praised <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents for `` responding twice as strongly to wild settlers'' and called on Palestinians to make donations to <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> on Wednesday. The leaflets repeated earlier calls for the resignation of Arab officials in occupied territories and demanded that Palestinians stop working in Jewish settlements. Another leaflet called for a general strike today.

 Four prominent intellectuals were expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, apparently because they were associated with the `` Democratic Forum,'' a loose group of mostly non-conformist intellectuals, artists and professionals calling for political change.

 Military leaders have fined officers a total of $ 4 million in a new drive to end corruption and abuses of power that are damaging Soviet military readiness, Pravda reported. The official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper on Sunday quoted chief military prosecutor <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> as saying officials were trying to stamp out evasion of military service, theft, damage of military equipment and other crimes. Pravda said the military had not been exempt from the stagnation and corruption that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to stamp out of Soviet society. Violations of laws and military regulations had become habitual among some commanding officers and political officers, he said. The fines were levied in the past two months against an unspecified number of soldiers, <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> said. Some soldiers were found to be renting private apartments and living outside barracks and stealing or damaging military property, Pravda said. Soldiers who busy themselves with outside economic activities have caused a `` great damage'' to Soviet military preparedness, Pravda said.

 Average retail gasoline prices jumped more than a penny-a-gallon during the past two weeks nationwide and motorists can expect the increases to continue, an analyst said.

Wholesale prices increased at twice the retail rate, analyst <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. `` This means retailers lost a penny of their operating margin during the period and it means that there is more price pressure to come in the immediate future,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congress May Postpone Asbestos Removal From Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education officials are urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give them more time to rid the nation's public and private schools of cancer-causing asbestos. The officials say there is insufficient money and trained manpower to meet this October's asbestos-inspection deadline, set in 1986 by a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> upset with the slow pace of the battle against the deadly substance. But groups representing teachers, parents and school employees are opposing a deadline extension, arguing that such a step is unwarranted and would prolong long-term health threats faced by millions of schoolchildren. `` Many local public school districts are incapable of compliance,'' a hearing by two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees was told recently by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` By extending the deadlines, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be sending a message to school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore or delay action on this serious health issue,'' says <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, first vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>. Once a common building material, asbestos is dangerous when it becomes friable, or crumbly. Friable asbestos releases the fibers that can cause a variety of respiratory ailments, including lung cancer. The fibers pose more threat to a child's lungs than to an adult's.

 Afghan guerrillas downed a Soviet-built passenger plane near the Soviet border, killing all 29 people aboard, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> reported. There was no immediate comment from the guerrillas. The report said the Antonov-26 passenger plane was shot down by a missile at 3:10 p.m. Sunday -LRB- 6:40 a.m EDT -RRB- while flying between <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northwestern <LOCATION> Faryab </LOCATION> province, and <PERSON> Mazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province. The cities are about 145 miles apart. The plane carried six crew members and 23 passengers, including two children, according to the report, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. It did not say whether the plane was a Soviet transport or a civilian airliner of the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> airline. Both fly the Antonov-26. The Afghan airline also has been known to carry commercial passengers in planes with military markings. The reported crash came three days after the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> announced an agreement to end the war between Moslem guerrillas and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government and clear the way for the removal of Soviet troops. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, quoting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the guerrillas attacked with anti-aircraft rockets. `` Once more, extremist opposition elements carried out a terrorist action,'' the radio said. `` As a result of this savage action by extremist elements, 23 passengers and six crew were martyred.'' Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> expressed sorrow and sympathy to the families of `` those who have been sacrificed to this criminal action,'' the report added. Despite the proposal to withdraw Soviet troops, the Afghan guerrillas have said they will continue to fight <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government until it is deposed. The civil war began 10 years ago when a communist coup brought to power a government friendly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On Sept. 13, 1987, Afghan guerrillas shot down an Antonov-26 near the northern city of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. Reports said 14 to 17 people were killed. The rebels are armed with U.S.-made Stinger and British Blowpipe anti-aircraft missiles. The radio did not identify the type of rocket used in Sunday's shooting The rebels acquired the Stingers in late 1986. They reportedly have shot down an average of one Soviet or Afghan aircraft a day since they received the heat-seeking Stinger and the radar-guided Blowpipe missiles. According to unofficial reports, about 200 people were killed last year alone while flying in the Afghan military planes. The communists seized power in a bloody April 1978 coup. Soviet troops entered the country in December 1979 to help the faltering government against the Moslem insurgents. An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops remain.

 A one-hour visit planned this week by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s royal couple has unleashed a wave of monarch mania in <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>. Every lamppost in town has Swedish and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, a pizza parlor printed special T-shirts for the occasion and inmates were rushing to finish a Swedish farmstead museum in the middle of an abandoned baseball field. `` It's going to be tremendous. <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> has n't had this much excitement in a long time,'' said <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the owner of Big <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Pizza. In honor of the royal visit, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> printed up commemorative Big John T-shirts for some of the 10,000 visitors expected to join King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> on Thursday. `` That's the closest we'll come to Swedish pizza,'' he said with a laugh.

The visit here is scheduled to last only 60 minutes and will cost about $ 300,000 in public and private funds, city recreation director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said.

 A proposal to turn former federal prison <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> into a casino crapped out in a newspaper survey of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> residents. `` I hate to sound so Californian, but it's just not good karma,'' said, one of those surveyed, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 30. `` It is just a dumb idea.'' The proposal, an advisory measure on the June 7 ballot, was opposed by a margin of 57 percent to 35 percent of the 600 people participating in the poll by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported today. Supervisors who placed Proposition N on the ballot say a casino could generate millions of dollars for the debt-plagued city. Several hurdles would have to be cleared first _ the city would have to acquire the land from the state, the state constitution would have to be changed to allow casino gambling, and numerous capital improvements would have to be made. <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION>, known as The Rock, now is a popular attraction for tourists who want to take a peek at the former home of gangster <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and other incorrigibles.

<TEXT>
 Sheba is n't a typical 6-year-old just because she likes candy, playing with the telephone and coloring. <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> is a chimpanzee who knows how to count. The chimp, who lives at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s animal laboratory here, is one of only two monkeys in the world able to count, and the only one that understands the concept of zero, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON>, director of the lab's primate cognition project. <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> said last week she believes that ability is a major step forward in defining the cognitive processes of higher primates and their similarities to those of humans. <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON>, who said the ability to count objects involves a different cognitive process than learning languages, was one of the participants in early studies that showed higher primates can learn language. More than a decade ago, <PERSON> Koko </PERSON>, a female gorilla, and <PERSON> Washoe </PERSON>, a female chimp, learned to use sign language to communicate with humans. But counting is a new research goal, and a hobby <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> indulges in when she is not playing with her keepers, with the four other apes at the lab or with <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON>'s dog <PERSON> Schuyler </PERSON>, who is her best friend. The chimp also dials telephone numbers at random when no one is watching. <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON>, a lab-born chimp owned by The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, will appear on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' this week and is the subject of a People magazine story due out this month. The surrogate mother-daughter relationship between <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sheba </LOCATION> and their mutual teasing has helped the chimp ignore the attention and get to work. In a recent demonstration, <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> was placed on the floor in front of a small, rectangular yellow plate. Above that was placed plastic squares with numbers ranging from zero to seven, mixed randomly. <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> then placed four apples on the plate. `` OK, <LOCATION> Sheba </LOCATION>. We're going to count some apples. How many?'' <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON>, fighting a desire to mug for a photographer, touched each apple, then pointed to the number five and looked to <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> for approval. `` You know that is not five apples. Try to tell me how many,'' <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> counted again and pointed to the number seven. It took another try and a hallway conference between <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> before the ape finally ignored the photographer and picked the correct number. <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> was rewarded with a kiss and a handful of M & amp; Ms and gumdrops. <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> has worked with <PERSON> Sheba </PERSON> for almost five years, and says the association has been rewarding from the start, even though <ORGANIZATION> Sheba </ORGANIZATION> would rather be playing. `` They have such a short attention span,'' <PERSON> Boysen </PERSON> said. `` At first she would n't try at all. But then she began to show us she could learn fast.''

<HEAD>Slayings Of 11 Women Remain Unsolved</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Desert Killings, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than three years after 11 young women were killed in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, only one of the crimes has been solved, leads are down to a trickle and residents remain fearful. The women, killed from September 1984 until May 1985, included waitresses, schoolteachers, receptionists, a bartender, a student and a homemaker. They died of stab wounds, gunshots and strangulation. One is missing and presumed dead. `` It was on all our minds. It was the conversation everywhere. Everyone was wishing that some of these women would be found,'' said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, 68, who lives across the street from the garage apartment where one victim lived. A multi-agency group spent more than a year investigating the deaths and, at one point, grew to more than 40 officers. By July 1985 the task force was reduced to 15 members. In mid-1986, Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Windham </PERSON> returned officers to their regular assignments. Detectives conducted more than 3,000 interviews and compiled a list of 7,000 suspects, including friends, acquaintances and relatives of victims. The investigation cost more than $ 1 million, <ORGANIZATION> Windham </ORGANIZATION> said. The different slaying methods convinced police that more than one killer was responsible, said Capt. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. Police today say they have suspects in three of the slayings but lack the evidence needed to file charges. Investigators sometimes spend time after work on the case in hopes of finding leads. Detective <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> says he often is led back to the spot where <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashka </PERSON>, 15, disappeared. He said he occasionally returns on the same night of the week she vanished to piece together where she headed after leaving a friend's apartment. `` When you go to a crime scene and see the things we do, and talk to the family, you know the family is depending on you. It's difficult to spend an eight-hour shift working on the case, put it down and go home,'' <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Kashka </PERSON> disappeared Dec. 30, 1984, after spending the evening with friends. She was found stabbed to death two days later near <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The slaying of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> was the only one solved. In October 1985, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> was convicted of her murder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison. The reams of neatly packed information investigators collected provides little comfort to families, homicide Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kratz </PERSON> said. `` You're talking to them several times a day,'' <PERSON> Kratz </PERSON> said. `` You finally get to the point there's nothing new to tell them.''

<TEXT>
 The Guardian Angels picketed film director <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>'s home to protest his new movie `` Colors,'' which the anti-crime group called a recruitment film for gangs nationwide. `` It starts with a drive-by killing and ends with the killing of an <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> cop. I do n't think that's the kind of message that needs to get out in this country,'' Guardian Angels leader <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said Sunday. The self-styled crime fighters, who picketed actor <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> on Saturday, set up symbolic coffins outside <LOCATION> Hopper </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> home and chanted `` Kids will die with pain; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> in the hall of shame. The movie, which stars <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> as police officers, is a drama set amid the gang wars of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> wrote and directed `` Colors.'' Police reported no problems during the weekend demonstration, which also included protesters lying on the ground to simulate a murder scene. The Guardian Angels want <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> to either halt distribution of the film or use some of its profits to support community organizations that combat gang violence, said <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>. It was n't known if <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> was home during the protest. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said some people were seen entering the house. Neither Hopper, nor <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> officials could be reached for comment Sunday about the protest by telephone. <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> has said previously he was surprised by objections to the movie. Gangs were blamed for nearly 400 killings last year in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and were the target of two unprecedented citywide police sweeps this weekend.

<HEAD>Man Arrested in NYC On Maryland Murder Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man sought for killing five people in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and one here is the sixth person to be arrested as a result of a TV program about the country's most wanted fugitives, according to police and the producers. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunstrom </PERSON>, 28, was seized after about 30 officers armed with shotguns and carbines surrounded a three-story building in the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> section. He was arrested in the building's basement after a brief struggle on warrants issued in Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md. He was carrying a loaded .45 - caliber handgun, and ballistics tests will be done to determine whether it was the murder weapon in the drug-related killings, homicide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinkaid </PERSON> said Sunday. The only shot fired during Saturday night's raid came from an officers' carbine, but no one was hit. So many officers participated in the raid because <PERSON> Dunstrom </PERSON> was considered dangerous, authorities said. The raid followed a three-week manhunt that began on a tip from a viewer of the television program, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' authorities said. <PERSON> Dunstrom </PERSON> was wanted in five killings in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, in January and one in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> in November, said <PERSON> Kinkaid </PERSON>. Police are still seeking <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, 25, and an unidentified suspect in the Jan. 22 slayings in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> of four men and a woman. Police said the two are members of Jamaican drug organizations. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> victims, who police said had been involved in drug trafficking organizations since the early 1980s, were shot in the head and chest with semi-automatic weapons while in an apartment. One woman shot in the neck survived the attack. The <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> victim _ <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 17, thought to be a cousin of the suspect _ was found shot once in the head on Nov. 26. `` We do n't know the reason for the shooting. He -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dunstrom </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is claiming it was an accident,'' said <PERSON> Kinkaid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dunstrom </PERSON> was featured in a March 13 episode of the half-hour weekly series in which actors re-create real crimes and viewers are shown photographs and given information on fugitives and asked to provide tips. They are promised confidentiality and sometimes rewards. The program has been on the air only 10 weeks, and shown on seven stations of the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. But because of praise from authorities, it was moved to a prime-time slot and starting Sunday will be broadcast on all of the network's 118 affiliated stations. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herwitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s vice president in charge of corporate and legal affairs, said that of the 30 fugitives featured so far, <PERSON> Dunstrom </PERSON> was the sixth to be arrested. Five were seized as a result of viewers' tips and one surrendered, he said. Detective <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shook </PERSON>, who is leading the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s investigation, said last week the show generated nearly 100 tips in the case

 An army of officers arrested 1,300 people in an unprecedented show of force against gang violence, but an official said drug-dealing gangs still rule the streets in parts of the nation's second-largest city. A 15-year-old boy was killed in a gang-related shooting Saturday night as the two-day police operation dubbed `` Fly the Flag'' wound down. Two others were killed in drive-by shootings, but there were no known gang connections. Nine people were wounded Sunday night in a gang-related shooting in <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, south of downtown, said sheriff's Detective <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Clift </PERSON>. None were seriously injured. `` From what we understand, the kids were playing outside,'' he said. `` None of these people are gang members, they're just innocent bystanders.'' Three gang members approached the residents outside a house and one of the three sprayed the group with gunfire, <PERSON> Clift </PERSON> said. The violence that continued during the sweep by 1,000 officers proves that gangs still have the run of the streets, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said. `` It just goes to show you, gang members just do n't care,'' <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> said. Police began the two-night sweep Friday night and arrested more than 1,300 people, about half suspected gang members, on a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges. Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> even made one collar. Police were unsure how many people remained in custody early today. About half the special police force, formed by putting officers on four hours of voluntary overtime after a full eight-hour shift, went to augment regular patrols in the south-central area, where gangs are most active. The rest of the officers spread out citywide. The sweep was the department's largest attack ever on gangs, which specialize in the sale and distribution of rock cocaine. Gangs are blamed for 205 killings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last year. Gang killings in all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> reached 387 last year. During the operation, officers stopped anyone who appeared to be a gang member by the way they were dressed and their alleged use of gang hand signals. In nine previous sweeps, which were smaller than `` Fly the Flag,'' police deployed 200 to 300 officers at a time only in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. There were 1,413 arrests in earlier sweeps _ 1,124 gang-related. The latest crackdown was lauded by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, founder of the fledgling Mothers Against Gangs in Communities. `` But the key is getting them off and keeping them off,'' she said. `` Parents will have to help the police keep them off the streets.''

<HEAD>Soviets Destroy First Six Missiles Under INF Agreement</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has exploded six SS-12 missiles that were removed from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under a superpower treaty to eliminate all land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said today. The missiles were exploded at a test site in southern <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, a republic of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> where they had been brought by train from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Feb. 25-March 13. Nuclear material was removed before the missiles were exploded, the official radio said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 8 to eliminate the medium - and shorter-range missiles, which have a range of 300 to 3,100 miles The SS-12s have a range of 560 miles. The treaty is awaiting ratification by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s nominal parliament. Passage by both sides is considered a virtual certainty. `` The first six Soviet shorter-range missiles liable for scrapping under the INF treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been exploded at a test site in southern <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said in an English-language broadcast. The explosions took place near the city of <LOCATION> Saryozek </LOCATION>, 125 miles north of the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> capital of <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did not say when the missiles were destroyed and gave no indication when more missiles might be exploded. It said that under the terms of the treaty, the missiles, launchers and all auxiliary equipment are to be destroyed. <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said in an article published on Sunday that local residents were worried about possible environmental damage but that there was none. The paper said an area of two miles around the missiles was considered a danger zone and that local people were warned far ahead of the blast. It quoted <PERSON> Alimbek </PERSON> <PERSON> Seytbekov </PERSON>, who was at work at a factory on the other side of a mountain about three miles from the blast, as saying he heard the noise but noticed no other effect. `` It is necessary to note here that the process of eliminating the missiles practically had no effect on the surroundings,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> said. `` An analysis of the air conducted by specialists showed no harmful substances.'' It said crews were given special training to destroy the missiles, and that dismantling of the guidance systems was an especially dangerous job because of of the presence of explosive rocket fuels. Fifty-four SS-12 missiles were stationed at four sites in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Soviet officials said in February that there had been 39 missiles and 24 mobile rocket launchers deployed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, expressing displeasure at the attendance of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, pulled out of an international meeting of religious leaders and lawmakers discussing global problems, the organizers said. `` We worked hard to get the Chinese here because we are discussing issues of great concern to them, like population growth,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiritual </ORGANIZATION> and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the leaders of the world's most populous nation had earlier shown a willingness to attend the five-day conference, which was to open today. `` But although we had no formal complaint from the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government about the attendance of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, we did get a letter from one of their bigwigs saying they were not coming because he was here,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsumura </PERSON>, a Japanese living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who organized the conference in the university city of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to invite the Chinese. `` We are disappointed that they are n't coming, but we will communicate closely with them with a view to involving them in our future activities,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said in an interview. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the religious and civil leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> before the 1950 <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover, fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> recently said the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> could return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> provided he accepts Chinese rule in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. He said he will not accept a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> offer to return but was willing to negotiate with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains it has held sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> since the 13th century. Tibetan independence advocates say the remote Himalayan region enjoyed de facto independence for most of that time. On March 5, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> arrested 200 people in an independence protest in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the fourth against Chinese rule there in five months. On Oct. 1, thousands of Tibetans led by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks stormed and set fire to a police station in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. At least 14 people died. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> was attending the conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` as a pre-eminent theologian known worldwide for his commitment to world peace and universal human causes.'' On Tuesday, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> will address the conference on the universal human condition. About 200 people from at least 60 countries are attending the conference, including <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, Christian, Hindu, Moslem and Jewish leaders. The meeting will discuss how participants will work together on the threat of nuclear war, terrorism and urban violence, population control, poverty, pollution, conservation and education. <PERSON> Matsumura </PERSON>, a family planning expert, said the main financial sponsors were <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a Japanese real estate developer, who put up $ 500,000, and three other benefactors who contributed $ 300,000 each.

 Moslem insurgents attacked the northwestern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION> with rockets and artillery, killing 13 people and causing serious damage, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today. The attack was on the same city from which a Soviet-built Antonov-26 plane took off for <PERSON> Mazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, 145 miles to the east, on Sunday. Official <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the plane was shot down by rebels, killing all 29 people aboard. `` Oppositionists brought down rocket and artillery fire on the town of <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION>, killing 13 people, among them women and children, wounding four people and inflicting considerable destruction upon the town,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say when the attack occurred, or provide any more information. <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION> is located 90 miles south of the Soviet border. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also reported that government forces had discovered a rebel arms cache including recoilless rifles, grenade launchers, small arms and ammunition in <LOCATION> Helmand </LOCATION> province. It said a group of insurgents had been routed by government forces in <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province, and that eight of them had been taken prisoner. The fighting took place as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were preparing to sign a U.N.-sponsored agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to end the Afghan conflict. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shelters millions of Afghans who have fled the fighting, and many Afghan guerrilla groups have bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another, and remained to fight the Moslem insurgents. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers will begin leaving on May 15 if an agreement is signed soon in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A toll-free spy hotline that urges soldiers to report suspicious activity and colleagues who receive phone calls from people with foreign accents has fielded more than 20,000 calls, an official said. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employee who for the past year has run the nationwide hotline from a windowless room at <ORGANIZATION> Forte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meade </ORGANIZATION>, says it has not led to any celebrated arrests. `` I know for a fact that there are investigations ongoing,'' <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said, adding that the calls have sparked several espionage probes by the military and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have heard we have provided significant leads.'' Although the hot line, 1-800-CALL-SPY, is designed for Army personnel across the country, most callers are civilians, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said. About 1 percent of the inquiries have provided worthwhile espionage or security-related tips, which are passed on to federal investigators ranging from <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` It's been effective,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ooley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The hot line, like any hot line, is an excellent resource for people to report this type of activity,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Fliers advertising the hot line urge soldiers to watch for colleagues who receive calls from `` someone with a foreign accent'' or `` brag about ... ` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>' - type Other telltale spy signs are `` a lot of unexplained money'' or odd requests `` for a manual, document or plan.'' The warnings might seem a bit melodramatic, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> admitted. `` Sound stupid? Yeah,'' he said. `` But these are actual cases.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says it has concerns about the possibility of abuse. `` It's inviting mischief,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, chief legislative counsel with the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` The allegations can have very serious consequences for someone.'' <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> conceded that the program might appear troublesome. `` Some people look at this and say, ` My God! Big Brother,''' he said. `` That is the furthest thing from our minds.'' Any information received over the phone is checked by several supervisors before it is sent to federal investigators, he said.

His score for Sunday's round was a 1-under-par 71 for a tournament total of 281, seven shots under par. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Calcavecchia </PERSON>, who was a caddy as recently as three years ago, finished second with a 2-under-par 70 in the bright, warm sunshine. He had a 282 total. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, the 1982 Masters winner, once had a share of the lead, but bogied the 16th hole and finished third at 283. Another former champion, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>, followed at 284 with a 72. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON>, the only six-time winner of the Masters, was at 292 after a 72, putting him in a tie for 20th place. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> had to come out of a yawning fairway bunker on the 18th hole of the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> course. `` I thought it was over,'' he said. `` That bunker has a steep face and I did n't think I could get the ball over the lip onto the green.'' His ball hit beyond the cup and backed up toward the hole while spectators howled. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, who had blown a two-shot lead earlier in the day, then made the birdie putt to win the title. In addition to the famed green winner's jacket, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> collected $ 183,800 from the total purse of $ 1 million.

<TEXT>
 The number of households tuned to the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministry's weekly show dropped by 200,000 in February 1988 compared to the previous year, but it held on to the top spot among religious broadcasts, according to a television rating service. Viewership for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s weekly program dropped from 2.161 million households in February 1987 to 1.961 million this year, figures released by <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday indicate. It was on Feb. 21 that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> admitted to sinning against his wife and family in a tearful confession from the pulpit at his Baton Rouge Family Worship Center. Although <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not specify his sin, it reportedly involved a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> prostitute. The Pentecostal minister resigned from the Assemblies of God church on Friday, the same day national church officials moved to defrock him. He said he was leaving the denomination because his $ 140 million per year ministry could not survive if he accepted a one-year preaching ban imposed by national Assemblies officials. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> also said Friday he would stay out of the pulpit until May 22nd in accordance with a three-month preaching ban proposed by the Assemblies' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> elders. He led the choir in his <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> church on Sunday, but did not offer a sermon. How <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s television ministry has been affected by the scandal will be more accurately measured when new Arbitron figures for May are released this summer. In February's ratings, his daily program `` A Study in the Word'' fell from 410,000 households to 323,000 households. It is rated No. 10 in religious programming, the results show <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s audience fell by 200,000 households or 10 percent during the year for the weekly program and by 87,000 households or 22 percent on a daily basis, according to <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the top ten television evangelists lost ground during the one-year period. No. 3 `` World Tomorrow'' was the only Top Ten show that grew, from 1.14 million households last year to 1.286 million this year The Moral Majority leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s show dropped 40 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> program, once hosted by defrocked Assemblies of God minister <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, did not crack the Top 20. It was rated No. 18 in November 1987, when the last ratings were taken. Television is the primary source of revenue for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry and the endeavor on which the most money is spent The ministry's own figures show it spends twice as much money on television time as on foreign missions. Ministry literature, which claimed a worldwide viewership of 510 million in 1986, now claims 300 million. In mid-March, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> hosted a week-long telethon during which they begged viewers to send money or use their credit cards to make donations to keep the Baton Rouge-based ministry alive.

 The 129 men who died 25 years ago in the nation's worst submarine disaster did not die in vain, the son of one of the victims said at a memorial service. `` Many, many lives have been saved because those guys gave their lives,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> at Sunday's service. His father died aboard the USS Thresher, which failed to surface from a deep dive off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast on April 10, 1963. The 275-year-old North Church was decorated Sunday with Easter lilies and a model of the nuclear submarine the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said could dive deeper and go faster than any other sub in the fleet. Cmdr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaplain, reminded more than 800 relatives and friends of the dead how <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> for sea trials 220 miles off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast. `` No scar was visible on the surface of the restless ocean to show where she sank,'' <PERSON> Shoberg </PERSON> said. `` But there would be scars: scars on the hearts of parents without children, wives without husbands, children without fathers.'' As the sub sank water pressure crushed the hull, killing all the men on board. <PERSON> Thresher </PERSON>'s remains lie more than a mile down on the ocean bottom. Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Axene </PERSON>, who commanded the Thresher until three months before the tragedy, shared the task of breaking news of the deaths to the families on April 10, 1963. <PERSON> Axene </PERSON> said Sunday that the Thresher, in his mind, `` remains a mighty ship, manned by a mighty crew still sailing the sea.'' `` She was intended to reach a new peak of perfection. And she did, but the price was very high,'' <PERSON> Axene </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> board concluded the sub's problems probably started with a leak in saltwater piping. The board said water had shorted out electrical circuits and shut down the nuclear reactor, leaving the submarine powerless. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> developed a program that included stricter construction methods, design improvements, testing for saltwater piping and more initial shallow-water sea trials. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> read the names of the dead at Sunday's service, which included a 40-minute choral requiem accompanied by harp and violin. When the two-hour memorial ended, the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> offered a 21-gun salute outside the church, while the shipyard sounded a 21-cannon salute and churches tolled their bells. While some cried as they left the church, many people hugged and chatted with friends they had n't seen in years. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, lost her husband <PERSON> John </PERSON> in the tragedy. She attended services with another widow, <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> DiNola </PERSON> of Rye, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> `` The people from Thresher are my extended family,'' said <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> who has not remarried. `` They're your support group.

 Although President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not been `` a hands-on leader'' in the Iran-Contra affair, he will be able to handle Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> if push comes to shove at the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, former president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said today. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can certainly handle him as a heavyweight, provided <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has the kind of advice he as a leader should have as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, provided he is well-briefed,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said in the second of four consecutive days on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. In an hour-long interview on the network's `` Meet the Press'' show Sunday, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the president should pardon <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> if he believes they engineered the Iran-Contra deal to serve the presidency. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said that he regrets not absolving his own advisers for their role in the Watergate scandal. Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program this morning, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said there is no question there has been a tendency to underestimate <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` because he sometimes forgets something or does n't handle press conferences well.'' But, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proved he could handle <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their summit in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> when he `` finally said no when it was a bad deal.'' `` With what happened in the Iran-Contra thing, certainly he was not hands on,'' said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` He is hands on where it really matters.'' The former president had stressed the necessity for such a leader in his new book, `` 1999,'' which he is promoting with the television apperances and other interviews. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the most significant foreign policy achievement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will be the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ `` because it is the first time the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has withdrawn forces from a country it invaded.'' Without Soviet troop support, he said, he doubts <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government can survive. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who will be appear again on `` Today'' Tuesday and Wednesday, discussed possible pardons for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and North Sunday in the most extensive of the interviews. The former president, who was driven from office in 1974 by Watergate, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should ask himself, `` Did these two men do what they did, believing, whether mistakenly or not, that they had the approval of the president, or were acting in order to serve his interests and would get that approval? `` If the president, after considering that, believes that that was the case, then he, the president, would have a good case for pardoning, because then the so-called crime would lack in intent,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the former national security adviser, and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who served as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, face charges of conspiring to divert proceeds of U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned military aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made several comments indicating he believes his former aides did nothing illegal and suggesting that he is favorably inclined toward pardons. But his official position on the subject remains one of neutrality, according to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said that in the early 1970s he asked himself about pardoning former advisers H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>. Both were convicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice and served time in prison. `` I probably should have pardoned them,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure that the country would have taken it at that time _ it was a little stirred up, as you might imagine. But, on the other hand, they had not done it for personal gain.'' The former president said `` personal gain'' also was not a consideration in the Iran-Contra affair. On `` Meet the Press,'' the 75-year-old <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also was questioned about Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, U.S.-Israel relations and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. _ On <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is under investigation, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said there are three points for the president to consider: `` One, is he an honest man; and two, has he been a competent attorney general; and three, is he a political liability ... I think he is an honest man. As far as the second matter is concerned, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes he's a competent attorney general in carrying out his conservative agenda. The third point, however, is the one you're really addressing, and that is, is he a political liability. And that's something only he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- can answer.'' _ On U.S-Israel relations: `` The problems in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> are so complex that it ca n't be done by the secretary of state on a part-time basis ... There has to be the appointment of a full-time heavyweight negotiator, and that appointment should be made ... to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. Now, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> is devious, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> is difficult, some people think he's obnoxious _ but he's a terrific negotiator. And I would suggest that the next president, be it -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would be well-advised to give him the title of ambassador plenipotentiary, give him a year, and he will work out some settlement.'' _ On <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>: `` I would say the major mistake I made as president was ... not doing early in 1969 what I did on May 3 of 1972 and on Dec. 15 of 1972, and that was to bomb and mine <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ... If we had done that then, I think we would have ended the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1969 rather than in 1973.''

<TEXT>
 A two-state public-health alert for pesticide-contaminated cucumbers is in effect in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> following illness in two Seattle-area families. The cucumbers, contaminated with aldicarb, were distributed by wholesalers to grocers in those two states and possibly northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, district director for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Symptoms of the infected cucumbers include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea within one hour of eating, usually within 30 minutes, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said Sunday. Other symptoms can include blurred vision, excessive sweating and muscle twitching. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said officials were unaware of any permanent health damage, adding that the symptoms pass quickly, like influenza. In fact, he said, many people in the area who thought they had the flu in the last week may have actually been suffering from the pesticide. Both cucumber-related illnesses were in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendizabal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The health alerts in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> took effect Saturday, although no illnesses were reported in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The cucumbers are European style, 12 to 18 inches long and about 1 -LCB- inches in diameter with pointed ends. They are wrapped in clear, unlabeled plastic, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said. Any skinny cucumbers without labels are considered suspect, said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, but those with a brand-name label showing they were grown elsewhere are considered safe. The cucumbers were grown in hothouses in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by Barnard Hydroponic of Redding and distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, an owner of <ORGANIZATION> Barnard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydroponic </ORGANIZATION>, refused to comment in a Sunday telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, saying he wanted to talk with <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials first. <ORGANIZATION> Aldicarb </ORGANIZATION> is used to treat soil before crops are grown and is used mostly for non-food crops, including cotton. Use of the pesticide on growing food products is illegal, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said.

 Harassment by <PERSON> white </PERSON> college students and cold shoulders from white professors are among the problems reported by black students who attend predominantly white schools. `` They just do n't want us there,'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said of her white peers at <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. She was among those attending a seminar on issues facing black students at white schools. `` I've been fighting since my first quarter,'' she said, recalling how she was shot in the leg with a BB gun while walking by a men's dorm on the south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> campus. `` It's pathetic to go through that kind of stuff while you're trying to get an education.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>, a white fraternity displayed a rebel flag last year during the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Day parade on campus, according to student <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> In an era when many blacks attend predominantly white institutions, such racial incidents are not unusual, according to more than 300 students and faculty from 14 states who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> seminar. The seminar ended Saturday. Statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> show that more than 66 percent of the nations 1.08 million <PERSON> black </PERSON> college students now attend predominantly white institutions. More than a dozen traditionally black colleges have closed in the last two decades, and still others are being merged with white institutions. At the seminar, some black students complained that white faculty members did n't devote enough time to them. `` It's sad when you see the professor has time to talk with white students after class, but when a black approaches that same professor, then all of a sudden he has to rush off to his office. That really hurts,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Americus </LOCATION>. Almost all students agreed that what they needed most was more black faculty members. Even at schools where there are black faculty, students say there are too few. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, said student <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, `` there are only 10 black faculty members out of 500, and out of the 10, only two are tenured.'' Some black faculty at white institutions say black students need advice on how to cope with racial stress. `` I try to get across to them that there is racism, and it's not going to go away, not in their lifetime,'' said <PERSON> black </PERSON> staff member Dr. <PERSON> Cleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, associate vice president of research at <ORGANIZATION> GSU </ORGANIZATION>. `` But what they can do to cope with it is to strive for excellence, not mediocrity. Only by being better than their white counterparts will they have an equal share of the rewards.'' Some whites feel that advances in race relations are gradually coming about. `` For the most part, my generation is less bigoted than generations past,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON>, student president at <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION>, `` but it's hard for some white students to overcome racist attitudes if they were raised in a bigoted manner.'' Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said negative racial attitudes can not be corrected by students alone. `` One of the first steps to eliminating racism on campuses is for the administration to take an official stand against racist behavior of any kind.'' Although integration has been urged by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, some black students fear they are losing part of their heritage. `` It's just another way whites are trying to take away some of our black culture,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and some fellow black students at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> recently organized the Concerned Students Association after a white professor was accused by a black female student of calling her a `` black bitch.'' In the days after the incident, 100 members of the association occupied the campus administration building. Last Wednesday, the students protested at a weekly assembly meeting because <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> was suspended with pay rather than fired.

The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for an opinion on whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government must accept arbitration in the dispute, which emanates from anti-terrorist legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last December. That law, which classifies the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group and bars it from operating on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory, led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to order the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a maneuver condemned by all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member nations except the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- secretary-general has the strong desire to avoid any confrontation with the host country,'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general, <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today. But he stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` urges the court to declare that indeed there is an obligation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' to submit the dispute to independent arbitration. <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON>'s remarks came during a 90-minute World Court hearing. Neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was officially represented at the session. In a recent letter to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said his government does not `` believe arbitration would be appropriate'' because the case is now before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is unable to plead its case here because only nation states and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bodies are entitled to appear before the World Court. The World Court, officially known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, is the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member judicial branch. It has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings. In the case now under consideration, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is required to accept arbitration in the matter under a 1947 accord between the world body and the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> administration. Under that pact, known as the Headquarters Agreement, disputes between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> arising from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> presence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be settled by arbitration. The accord calls for a three-member arbitration panel, made up of one member appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, one appointed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and one chosen by mutual consent. Although the accord does not specifically mention missions, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> maintains its rules concerning the unhindered functioning of diplomats accredited to its headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also apply to the missions of member nations and organizations with observer status. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was granted non-voting observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. It has maintained an office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> since then. Several weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> refused to close its office there. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was expected to respond in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case today, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was expected to file a brief supporting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> position. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boycott of the World Court proceedings marks the second time in four years that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has refused to take part in one of its cases. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claimed the court had no authority to handle a complaint against it filed in 1984 by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and boycotted the last 17 months of the proceedings in that case. The World Court ultimately ruled in favor of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and ordered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to halt its support for the Contra rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government.

 American and French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be killed if security forces storm a hijacked Kuwaiti jet in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, a pro-Iranian group said in a statement. `` To the families of the hostages, we declare that we shall execute the Western captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the plane and holy warrior -LRB- hijackers -RRB- aboard is subjected to any military foolhardiness,'' the statement by the Shiite Moslem group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Z Channel Executive Shoots Wife, Then Himself in Murder-Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pioneering programming executive for the Z Channel pay television service apparently shot his wife to death and then turned the gun on himself, authorities said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 39, a vice president at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica-based </LOCATION> service, was found dead in his <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> home, along with his wife of one year, <PERSON> Frederica </PERSON>, `` Deri'' <PERSON> Rudulth </PERSON>, also 39, on Saturday, said Z Channel spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was listed as a suicide and his wife as a homicide victim, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office investigator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said Sunday. A police report said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was believed to be suffering from a mental disorder. `` He had been sick all last week,'' <PERSON> Clein </PERSON> said. `` He had an ulcer and I guess he was bothered by it. He was n't in the office, but he felt better Friday.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> joined the Z Channel in 1980 and was credited with attracting an influential entertainment industry audience to the 14-year-old service. As programming chief, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> developed the popular and successful format that combined classic, European and artistic films with high-powered Hollywood movies. This month, the channel added <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> home games to its line-up. Under <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s direction, Z broadcast the uncut versions of such films as `` Heaven's Gate,'' `` 1900,'' `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'' and `` Das Boot.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rudulth </PERSON>, a former attorney and stand-up comedian, also published the Westwood Insider, a free weekly newspaper that circulated in the upscale west side of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Next-door neighbor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> said she was pruning roses around Saturday afternoon when she thought she heard a gunshot. She said she disregarded the noise as probably children playing, but then heard a second shot about an hour later. `` -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Rudulth </PERSON> -RRB- was an exemplary neighbor for me,'' <PERSON> Pringle </PERSON> said. `` I did n't really know him. He seemed to be an odd person. He'd apparently been having nervous problems, and she was vulnerable and was there.'' The slayings occurred two days before <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> was to have given a deposition in a lawsuit filed by Z Channel against rival cable television service Home Box Office, the nation's largest. The suit contends the <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` secured or coerced'' the cooperation of four major film studios in `` restraining and impairing'' Z Channel's ability to compete with <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> was concerned,'' said <PERSON> Clein </PERSON>. `` The Z Channel was a great love of his. But I think he felt things were going along well, and that in view of the suit that Z had a good case.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> officials are planning to knock down a recently renovated building and make a parking lot, despite workers' complaints that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is wasting money. Workers and the president of the union representing civilian employees at <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for sinking $ 161,000 into a building they planned to demolish. But 1st Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobb </PERSON>, a base spokesman, said Building 1522 was renovated earlier this year to improve working conditions because a specific date to tear down the building had not yet been set. The building is near a $ 19 million <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> facility that is under construction and targeted for completion in June 1989, said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, another base spokesman. <PERSON> Lobb </PERSON> said Building 1522, now used as office space, would be razed at some point to provide room for parking space for the new command center. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, president of Local R7-23 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said union officials questioned the need for the renovation during meetings with base management to discuss money-saving measures. `` There's nothing you can do if they've already spent money. Once it's spent, it's gone, so we concentrated on things that could be avoided. But -LRB- this kind of project -RRB- is what we said was work that was not necessary,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>People Drinking Less, But Character Of The Change Unclear.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People seem to be drinking less, and they worry about alcohol more, but health researchers disagree about what it means. `` Overall, there's a clear trend in the direction of moderation,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsten </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` In terms of social mores, the public message used to be that it's cool to get smashed. Now, it's dumb to get drunk.'' The cutback in consumption grows in part from recent court rulings in some states recognizing host liability for drunken guests, he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` Legal deterrence is a major factor in the moderation, but I think it goes beyond that,'' he said. `` There is just much more informal social pressure not to drink as much.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wechsler </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the move to curb excess involves a limited part of society. `` I still think we have a six-pack syndrome out there in much of our society, and the data is there to support it,'' he said. `` Alcohol consumption has dropped, but not markedly and young people are drinking as much as ever.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislator Rep. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bump </PERSON> filed legislation last week to put warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers in the state. `` The bottom line is that alcohol is still the nation's drug of choice and a major health problem, especially among young people,'' she said. A recent Gallup Poll showed that the number of adults who believe that alcohol is a problem in their homes has doubled since 1974 to 24 percent. In 1980, per person consumption was 2.5 gallons of liquor, 2.6 gallons of wine and 30.7 gallons of beer. In 1985, liquor use dropped to 2.2 gallons, beer eased off to 29.6 gallons, but wine consumption rose to 2.9 gallons. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>'s, an Irish pub in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the bar now sells five cases of nonalcoholic beer weekly, while three years ago there were no takers. `` People are just drinking less, although they're drinking more of the quality stuff,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said, adding that his bartenders now shut off patrons more quickly.

<HEAD>Naturalists Worried About Wood Storks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wood storks have come home to roost in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered birds wo n't have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the fish the birds rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> refuge about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> that was once the primary stork-nesting area in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cuthbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. `` We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinchcliff </PERSON>, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. `` Whether or not there's enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.'' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent birds will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young birds to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of birds successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The birds have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the interior <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year's young wo n't be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> said.

 A 25-year-old former Boy Scout allegedly attacked his old scoutmaster with a knife after a chance meeting brought back memories of a 12-year-old grudge over a merit badge, police said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> was held on $ 110,000 bail in the assault on <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 55, police said. <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> told authorities that <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> had kept him waiting too long when he went to his home as an eighth-grader to work on a merit badge project. <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran, did not see <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> again until he passed him on the street two weeks ago, said Little Silver police Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> says he does n't remember <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON>, who grew up here and now lives a few miles away in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the chance encounter prompted `` flashbacks'' for <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON>.

 Parents are sewing identification labels into their children's clothing. Teen-age girls are heading home early. And volunteers are sifting through the desert sands looking for more bodies after finding six young women buried in shallow graves. Residents in northeastern <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> are dealing with the slayings of the six young women, ages 14 to 24, in many ways while the city's police chief calls on residents to be careful, not alarmed. In response, far fewer young women can be found loitering around bars, convenience stores and motels, even on warm spring nights. `` -LRB- The slayings -RRB- brought it home to them that maybe they're not invulnerable,'' says <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, head counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> who consoled friends of 14-year-old <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Parkland dropout whose remains were discovered Oct. 20. `` They're more careful about walking out by themselves. They're more conscious about coming home by their curfew,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said The killings also inspired a community group to give elementary school children identification cards to be sewn into their clothing or laced into their shoes. `` One thing we've noticed in seeing pictures of grave sites or even auto accidents is that there is always a shoe at the scene,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which ordered 10,000 tags for students. The police investigation centers around the deaths of <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Frausto </PERSON>, 17; <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 20; <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casio </ORGANIZATION>, 24; <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>, 15; Ivy <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 23; and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frausto </PERSON> was last seen behind a tavern in northeast El Paso. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was last spotted getting into a car at a motel on the same street. Her body and <ORGANIZATION> Casio </ORGANIZATION>'s were found Sept. 4 buried among creosote bushes in the desert 18 miles northeast of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Since then, the bodies of the four other young women were found in shallow graves in the same litter-strewn patch of desert. Police are almost certain the women were victims of the same killer but refuse to discuss most aspects of the case. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a convicted sex offender, was described as a possible suspect in the case by a detective testifying at <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s rape trial <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 30, who had been jailed since his Oct. 23 arrest on the rape charge, was convicted last month and sentenced to 50 years for his fourth sex crime conviction. His victim testified that he kidnapped her last summer, took her to an area near where the bodies were later found, and started digging a hole. When he heard voices, he took the woman across the street, raped her and left her naked in the desert. About a month after that attack, the first body _ that of <ORGANIZATION> Casio </ORGANIZATION> _ was discovered by a utility employee digging at the site. Police searched the area that day and found Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s remains about 50 yards away. Police scoured a 10-square-mile area with borrowed heat-sensing equipment mounted on airplanes. The Department of Corrections also provided dogs to sniff for more bodies. On Oct. 20, the dogs found the remains of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> within a half-mile of the first two. On Nov. 2, police using dogs found the remains of Miss <PERSON> Frausto </PERSON>. Police gave up searching a few weeks later, saying they were confident they had found all the bodies buried in the area. But on March 14 _ the first day of <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s rape trial _ a pair of aluminum-can collectors stumbled upon the bones of Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The last two victims were not among three young women from <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and neighboring Chaparral, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who are listed by police as missing. Last weekend, more than 300 searchers failed to unearth more bodies. Volunteers carrying shovels and pitchforks included soldiers, jail guards, police officers, sheriff's deputies and reserves, fire marshals and Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said although no bodies were found, they may go back and do it `` over and over again'' next weekend.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> began three days of official mourning today after an ammunition depot blast that officials said killed 93 people and wounded 1,100. Newspapers today reported more than 100 dead. Hundreds of people who lived close to the army depot, located between <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, remained unaccounted for after Sunday's blast. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Radio broadcast appeals for missing people, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> ordered the removal of dangerous ordnance from populated areas. Pakistanis repaired their cinderblock houses or sifted through the ruins in search of salvageable household goods. Rescuers continued their search for victims. Police and army troops patrolled the dusty streets as entire families roamed the worst-hit areas to view the damage and search for loved ones. Officials said about 100 bomb disposal teams were clearing an estimated 6,500 different kinds of projectiles that lay strewn among the two cities. President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-haq </PERSON> today refused to speculate on the cause of a fire which reportedly ignited the ammunition dump between the twin cities of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, showering both with rockets, grenades and artillery shells. As to reports that the ordnance was earmarked for Afghan Moslem insurgents, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said: `` It's nothing but speculation _ a high measure of speculation.'' Eyewitnesses reported seeing burning trucks near the depot bearing Afghan license plates. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> backs the guerrillas in their struggle against <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops who back it It also serves as a conduit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the insurgents. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said the dead included seven army soldiers. He said 60 percent of the total number of wounded had been treated and released. Official sources said the blast was caused by a fire but Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had heard reports of a possible military coup attempt. Some embassies said they received anonymous telephone calls warning of a terrorist bombing shortly before the facility blew up. The explosions, which occurred during morning rush hour Sunday, sent missiles and grenades slamming into buildings, buses and cars in the capital and the adjacent city of <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. The initial blast flattened most buildings within 200 yards of the depot and sprayed shrapnel and unexploded projectiles for more than a six-mile radius. There were no reports of casualties among the estimated 25,000 foreigners who live in the capital. Also Sunday, eight people were killed in a fire at an arms factory near <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, 140 miles south of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, and three people were injured by a bomb that exploded in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, 650 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Authorities said those two incidents appeared unrelated to the disaster in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, riots broke out today when mobs of students tried to close shops in northern <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state to show sympathy for the victims of Sunday's explosion at the ammunition depot. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported that scores were injured when police clashed with the students. The news agency said the mobs set fire to an army jeep, burned down a liquor store and stoned passing vehicles. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars, two of them over <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. Some of the Moslems, who predominate in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state, want to unite with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. There have been numerous explosions and bomb attacks in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> during the past two years that have killed about 300 people and injured hundreds. The government frequently has blamed attacks on agents of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government, which has denounced <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> support of Afghan rebels. Many bombings have also occurred during violent demonstrations by opposition parties demanding the resignation of President <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. The ammunition dump is located at <LOCATION> Faizabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crossing </LOCATION>, near the capital's border with <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. Army troops and riot police were deployed around <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to seal off dangerous roads and prevent panic. One of the dead was identified as a lawmaker and former minister of production and public works, <PERSON> Khaqan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbasi </PERSON>, whose car was hit by a rocket. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> is a city of 500,000 built during the 1960s to replace <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> as the capital. In addition to government buildings, it contains about 85 foreign embassies and several offices of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and other international relief agencies.

<HEAD>Panamanian Leader Says He'd Rather Be Somewhere Else</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> today was quoted as saying he would really rather be somewhere else, but that he was fighting an American attempt to control <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Ah yes,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today. `` I would like to be somewhere else.'' He did not say where. Although <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is ready to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the newspaper said, he is not ready to be pushed out. `` Foreigners have trouble understanding our mentality,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` It is a struggle that we have been waging for a long time against the American presence here. It is not a personal fight, but that of a people and a nation. It is the destiny of a country that is at stake.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is convinced that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who always opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, wants to reclaim the canal. `` The attitude of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is very suspect,'' the general was quoted as saying. `` We began to have problems with it from the moment we denounced violations of the treaties, when we defended an independent, Third World, non-aligned policy on the international scene, and above all when we refused to participate in a military intervention in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to overthrow the Sandinista regime.'' He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` wants to rewrite history, cancel the treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing social achievements.'' Asked if his departure would not put an end to the crisis and ease the suffering of the Panamanian people, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said: `` I refuse to answer that question,'' he said. `` If the people are suffering, it is because of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not me.'' He brushed aside questions about his role in the drug trade. `` The problem is not here,'' he said. `` It is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the consumer country. It is there that the drugs are paid for. There are drug-producing countries and there are consumer countries. The other countries, like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, are passage routes.'' The general agreed that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s liberal financial laws make it easy for drug transactions, but he said `` the money was not invested here ... therefore you can not say that the laundering of this drug money is done here. We were only a step in the process controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was behind making <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a banking center, `` and it is they who have decided to dismantle it.''

<TEXT>
 An opposition leader forced into exile by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> after calling on Panamanians to step up protests designed to oust the strongman. In another development, doctors and pharmacists on Sunday said a lack of dollars brought on by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions has caused a medicine shortage and broad cuts in hospital services in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The opposition leader, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, in a letter released before he left Sunday evening, urged Panamanians to `` organize your family, your street, your neighborhood and protest.'' `` When you decide to protest in all the streets of all the cities of the Panamanian isthmus and decide to do it every day, we will reach victory.'' The opposition leader was freed on Thursday after being imprisoned for 10 days following his arrest during an anti-Noriega march he led in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, 49, faced a long prison term on a sedition charge filed by the government last summer if he did not accept exile. In the past week several announced anti-Noriega demonstrations either drew few participants or were stopped before they began by a heavy police presence. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> is one of 35 leaders of the National Civic Crusade, an opposition organization of 200 business, labor, professional and political groups seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. Sunday's departure was the second time the opposition leader had been sent into exile. He lived in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for two years after Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s predecessor, ordered <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> into exile in 1976. In an interview published today, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quoted as saying that he would rather be somewhere else than <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but that he was fighting an American attempt to control <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Ah yes,'' the general was quoted as telling the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would like to be somewhere else.'' He did not specify where. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is convinced that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who opposed the 1977 treaties turning over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, wants to take back the canal. He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` wants to rewrite history, cancel the treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing social achievements.'' Several other leaders of the anti-Noriega protests that began in June 1987 went into exile in September after warrants were issued for their arrests. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was barred from the country when he tried to return from a business trip on Feb. 25. He was allowed back in at the end of March. On Saturday, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> called for an international boycott that goes beyond existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions to press for an end to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is the power behind the civilian government. Last February, a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rejected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demands that he resign and leave the country. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses the American dollar as its currency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions include freezing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s dollar deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, withholding payments to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commision </ORGANIZATION> and, most recently, prohibiting American companies and citizens from paying taxes to the Panamanian government. The taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, ousted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 26 after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president. With the most recent sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, some American businessmen have said they can be fined and jailed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for paying taxes to the government and be closed down by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if they do n't. `` I think we're going to see a lot of closings,'' of American companies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said one businessman, speaking on condition of anonymity. The economic crisis caused by the sanctions has prompted the medicine shortage and hospital cutbacks, doctors and pharmacists said on Sunday. Elective surgery, X-rays and laboratory tests have been postponed, the sources said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Bella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, doctors said the staff has been cut from 92 to 30. One pharmacist said he was out of many medicines, including some antibiotics and heart medicines. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity. The cash crisis has prompted <PERSON> Ricaurte </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON>, minister of planning and economic policy, to ask officials of the Latin American Economic System for financial help from member governments and banks. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> two weeks ago, members of the organization overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and condemning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions but did not come up with any money. Most Latin American governments have severe financial problems of their own.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tackled a sensitive issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s key primary by saying he would not meet again with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is playing up his own strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said today he must finish strong in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for his campaign to continue. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, with its prize of 255 delegates, is eight days away, and all three Democrats were stumping in the state today. The trio had three debates scheduled this week _ their first full-scale faceoffs since last month's Super Tuesday campaign. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, bidding to stay in the spotlight although he virtually has the Republican nomination wrapped up, was beginning three days of campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only remaining rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has all but abandoned his effort. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he will remain in the race through the national convention in July, but must turn in a convincing performance in the primary. `` We're running to win here but at a minimum we have to have a finish that convinces you ... that, well, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did it. He has the momentum. He has the strength to go on,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said on `` CBS This Morning.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic front-runner, spent Sunday at home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> celebrating the Greek Orthodox Easter with his family. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaigned in a heavily Jewish part of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been criticized by Jewish leaders for meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, was asked Sunday whether he would do so again. `` I would not _ and it's not necessary to do that,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements. That's a formula for catastrophe.'' He added, `` In this city, some of your top Palestinian leaders in the world live. Some of your top <PERSON> Jewish-American </PERSON> and pro-Israeli leaders live here. We should begin to talk here to implore both sides to a higher level of security.'' In the interview on Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went out of his way to be conciliatory toward <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. In recent days, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has blasted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lack of government experience and his foreign policy views, and said the nation needs a `` president, not a preacher.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mild rejoinder on Sunday: `` Well, both of us went to seminary.'' Asked if <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s remarks had been unfair, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` No, I think that <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has too much character to be categorically unfair.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, for his part, praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for saying he would n't sit down with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` The statement <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made this morning was very constructive. That's a change in his position, I believe,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, appearing in heavily Jewish neighborhoods, picked up the endorsement of state Assemblyman <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON>. At one stop, <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> by denouncing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the candidate who `` embraced <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'' and saying that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was the only one who `` had the courage'' to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But when he spoke, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did n't discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, also interviewed on the CBS program, said he did not intend to change his campaign style despite criticism from Democratic heavyweights like party chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> over attacks on the other Democrats. `` I have no plans to change my basic campaign posture at all,'' he said. Democratic non-candidate <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, meanwhile, offered a confusing succession of statements on whether he would accept a draft from a deadlocked convention. On Saturday, during a telelphone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he declared: `` I've ruled it out.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, immediately denied that the governor had intended to say he would refuse a draft, and meant instead that a draft should not take place. On Sunday, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> told the AP: `` I think it is absolutely a reasonable interpretation to say that if a person says it's wrong, it's counterproductive, it's unwise, it should n't be, then that means he rejects a draft.'' But when asked flatly if the correct interpretation was that he would not accept a draft, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said, `` I think so.'' He was more direct when asked much the same question by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. `` Yes. You're absolutely correct. That's accurate. Now I hope there are no questions left about my role,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said Sunday that the fight for the nomination will help the Democrats by keeping the party's candidates in the spotlight _ unlike the Republican race, where the suspense is gone. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself acknowledged that. `` I've got to look more frantic,'' he joked to reporters traveling with him on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two over the weekend as he returned from a round of fund-raisers _ his last of the primary campaign. `` I think we've just got to recognize ... we're not going to get the intensive political coverage.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win the general election in November, but that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee will give him a run for his money. The former president was asked on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was too dull to be an effective nominee. `` I've often said ... that the best politics is poetry rather than prose,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> replied. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a poet, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is a poet, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a word processor _ that's what it gets down to.' `` On the other hand,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` he's cool, he's intelligent, he's tough, he's good in debates He's going to be a very formidable candidate.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today deported eight more Palestinians to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying they incited anti-Israeli protests. Leaders of the four-month uprising in the occupied lands called for a `` day of firebombing'' later this month. The army said five of those deported today were from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and three from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on Jan. 13, sparking protests of the action as a violation of the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of citizens in occupied zones. The army said deportation orders had been issued for 12 other Palestinians from the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. The Palestinians ordered deported may appeal. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported more than 1,000 Palestinians since 1967. Six of the 12 ordered deported are from <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, the site of a clash between <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-agers and Palestinians. Two Arabs and an Israeli girl died in the melee. Also today, Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> shuttered their stores and stayed home from jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders. The army, meanwhile, promised the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> it would give 48 hours notice before destroying more homes in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. An army statement said the eight Palestinians who were deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today were `` leading organizers and instigators of the recent violent public disturbances'' in the occupied territories. The statement said those from <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> who were slated for expulsion had played `` an active part in the attack'' on the Israeli teen-agers, who were on a hiking expedition. The army says it has destroyed 13 houses of villagers accused of inciting the clash. Villagers claimed 23 houses hadbeen knocked down. The latest underground leaflet circulated in the occupied lands praised <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> for `` showing settlers a lesson'' during the incident and called on Palestinians to raise money for `` the heroic village.'' As before, the leaflet was signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The leaflet also congratulated Palestinians for refusing to meet with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour. `` Your uprising stopped <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> from his fake plan, and he went back to his country as a big failure, without any of our people having met him,'' the leaflet said. Business came to a virtual standstill in towns and cities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> today as residents observed a commercial strike. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, the central market was closed and tourist shops lining Manger Square were shuttered. No Arab taxis or buses were operating into or out of the town where Christians believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born. A complete strike was also observed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the rest of the coastal strip, Palestinian reporters there said. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents reported all stores in the city were closed, as were businesses in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Residents of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said more than half of the Arab workers who normally travel to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home. The latest leaflet called for further commercial strikes on Thursday and Saturday and for more days of protest honoring Arabs killed in the last four months. Israeli troops or settlers have killed 141 Palestinans since violence broke out Dec. 8, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. One Israeli soldier and one civilian have been killed during that time. The leaflet called for a `` Palestine Molotov Day,'' referring to the Molotov cocktails, or firebombs, often thrown by rioters at Israeli targets. `` -LRB- The day -RRB- is Palestine Molotov Day, as an answer to the authorities position to give settlers the right to shoot at any Molotov throwers.'' The leaflet designated April 21 as `` Palestine Molotov Day'' and called for a general strike the same day. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was quoted last month as saying <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians could shoot at firebomb throwers if they had no other way to extricate themselves from a life-threatening situation. The leaflet also told Palestinians to boycott Israeli products, especially during the monthlong Moslem holiday of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, which begins next weekend. Debate continued today over the clash in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. In a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing on an appeal brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, officials promised to give 48 hours notice before destroying any more homes in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> and to give villagers `` a reasonable amount of time'' to appeal. <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, a state prosecutor, said the army had no immediate plans to destroy more homes in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>. But she stressed that the army probe of the clash was not over and might turn up more suspected inciters. Ms. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said army policy was to provide a warning before demolitions unless an incident was considered `` particularly grave.'' She said the <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> clash fell into that category. The army is expected within a few days to release its findings on the <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> clash. On Sunday, Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators criticized the army for saying <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, 15, had been accidentally killed by a shot from a gun carried by a Jewish settler who was guarding the teen-age hikers. They insisted she was shot by an Arab that some saw pointing a rifle from a rooftop. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a weekly Cabinet session Sunday that an army autopsy showed Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was apparently struck by a bullet from the M-16 rifle of <ORGANIZATION> Romem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dubi </ORGANIZATION>, one of two settler guards who accompanied the teens on their hike near <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings on organized crime today that law enforcement efforts have seriously damaged, but not destroyed, the nation's organized crime families. Testifying at the most extensive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings on organized crime in nearly 25 years, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s extensive intelligence system indicates that many organized crime enterprises `` which have existed unfettered for years have been dismantled.'' Sessions told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations that the secrecy of the criminal underworld `` has been co-opted'' by the cooperation of organized crime figures with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most importantly, their ability to influence and intimidate the business and political community is weakened,'' Sessions said. The hearings were held amid stringent security measures, with a metal detector set up outside the hearing room. Inside the room were charts listing organized crime families of today and the charts used in 1963, when convicted murderer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON>, appearing before the same panel, introduced the phrase `` La Cosa Nostra'' into the national consciousness. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., opening the new hearing, said the crime family `` soldiers'' listed in the charts from the Valachi hearings `` appear today among the highest-ranking powers in the <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- La Cosa Nostra -RRB- families. Sessions, the leadoff witness, told the subcommittee, `` The question most often asked is whether we have eradicated the <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> as a national threat. The simple answer is no. They continue to engage in a wide variety of criminal activities. ...'' <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON> was the star witness in the widely publicized 1963 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigation of organized crime, unfolding a complex story of murder, terror, crime and vice. He described the La Cosa Nostra organization and named alleged members. <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>, described as a former member of the <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> Nuova Sicilian Mafia family in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, was scheduled to testify after Sessions. The subcommittee has set four days of hearings this month _ today, Friday, April 21 and April 22. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonardo </PERSON>, described as the former boss of the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> La <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> family, leads off Friday's hearings. In the 1963 hearings, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON>, who was serving a life sentence in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> federal penitentiary, said <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON> was a highly organized unit with a strict code guaranteed by blood ties and arranged marriages within the tight framework of the crime syndicate. He testified that the organization had been responsible for many gangland deaths throughout the country, including the slayings of mobsters <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anastasi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalise </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> called the Valachi case `` the biggest intelligence breakthrough yet in combating organized crime and racketeering in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said federal authorities had `` full confidence'' in <LOCATION> Valachi </LOCATION>'s testimony and called for comprehensive legislation to deal with organized crime, including new federal wiretapping powers and immunity for witnesses in racketeering probes. In announcing the new hearings, the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said, `` In the wake of an impressive array of successful prosecutions, it is important that we take stock and assess just how far we have come in the war against organized crime. `` Some have described the recent prosecutions of mob hierarchies as the final death knell of La <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Nostra </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Others argue that these prosecutions merely remove one mob hierarchy and replace it with another _ as powerful and sometimes even more vicious than the old.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the subcommittee, as it did 25 years ago, will hear from witnesses who will describe how organized crime has survived despite periodically successful attacks by law enforcement agencies. `` These hearings will not only try to determine if any additional law enforcement legislation is needed, but also whether the federal government is effectively using these tools that have already been provided to them,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` In particular, we are interested in reviewing the recent successful civil and criminal prosecutions under the 1970 racketeering statutes. `` Not only will we be interested in the impact of those recent successes but also the ability to transfer such tactics to other areas of organized criminal activity _ particularly to the fields of labor racketeering, narcotics trafficking and other emerging organized crime groups,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said occasional successes in battling organized crime should not lead to complacency. `` These secret criminal societies recognize only the law of the jungle and respect only the wealth of ill-gotten gain,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` We must recognize the new face of organized crime in this country. It is important that we take this opportunity to examine whether the strategies we've successfully used in the past will be effective in the future.''

 The owner of two Indian elephants says he'll agree to sell the 3 -LCB- - ton animals if their former owner, who apparently has been hiding the pachyderms for four years, will return them <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, owner of a now-closed <LOCATION> Tehachapi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, animal farm, said Sunday he wants to get fair market value for the 27-year-old female elephants, appraised at $ 70,000 apiece. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said he has spent `` thousands and thousands of dollars'' crisscrossing the country searching for <PERSON> Arlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>, the man who fled with the elephants, <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> and Duchess. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>, who raised the elphants from infancy, contacted The Star Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> several weeks ago from an undisclosed location and said he would return to face charges of third-degree theft if the elephants were not given to <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> sold the elephants to the Drakes for $ 80,000 in 1981 but said he repossessed the animals for non-payment. The Drakes successfully fought the action and in May 1984 Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> awarded them $ 107,000 in damages. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> also charged that <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, 50, and his son, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 30, abused the animals. The Drakes deny that charge. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>, 58, fled with the elephants from a farm in <LOCATION> Colts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> while the animals were with a circus in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. He has been on the lam ever since. `` It's been at a standstill for four years,'' <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said from his sister's <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. `` We have to do something.'' <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said Sunday he had contacted <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> of East Orange, and was awaiting an answer to his proposal. Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, an animal activist, was not in her office today for additional comment, a secretary said.

Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> businessman is interested in the animals and that she is trying to work out a deal. Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> has said she does not know where or how <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> has been concealing the elephants. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> has said he left his farm at <LOCATION> Fordland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and his career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for the elephants, which eat about 200 pounds off hay a day. He said he has n't seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off with the animals.

 Jury selection began with tight security today at the trial of a southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dairy farmer accused of killing seven members of his family in a fall shooting spree. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>, 36, of nearby <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>, faces seven counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife and her brother and his family on Sept. 25. Immediately after the killings, police had speculated that one of the victims, a 14-year-old boy, was responsible. Highway Patrol officers helped <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies search the courtroom and inspect each spectator with a metal detector before proceedings began. Sheriff <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraker </PERSON> said the security measures were taken as a precaution and not because of any threats. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> sat quietly between his two attorneys. His hands were clenched tightly but unshackled. He began to cry quietly when the judge read the charges against him to the potential jurors. More than 100 prospective jurors were scheduled to be interviewed today. The courthouse is a short drive from the scene of the slayings at two family dairy farms in the tiny community of <LOCATION> Elkland </LOCATION>. Proceedings are likely to center on what prosecutor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> says is <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s confession. According to statements made in a pre-trial hearing in February, <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON> implicated himself Oct. 5 at <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> troop headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, where, as the only witness in the slayings, he had been taken to undergo a lie detector test. <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s attorneys, county public defender <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNabb </PERSON> and special state public defender <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, had attempted to have <PERSON> Schnick </PERSON>'s statements suppressed.

 Black students boycotted classes today at <ORGANIZATION> Denison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to protest what they call lenient treatment of white students involved in a racial incident, and about 400 students and faculty members attended a rally. University spokesman <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said the rally was peaceful and included a speech by university trustee <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyree </PERSON>, who said he would recommend the institution adopt a policy of immediate suspension from school for racial harassment. `` They're really using it as an educational opportunity to address the issues and incidents of racism that they've seen on the increase,'' <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said of the rally. `` They're putting it into the context of the new racism on campuses these days.'' The protest resulted from an incident last week. Two students accused of verbally harassing <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Laramore </PERSON>, a black senior from <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> who is head resident at the private school's <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> dormitory, were suspended for one semester Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. A third white student was found innocent. About 80 of 2,100 undergraduates at the school in a suburb of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> are black, <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. The white students, who lived in a room adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Laramore </ORGANIZATION>'s, testified that they were having a private conversation early on the morning of April 1. But the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> claimed the racial slurs were aimed at <LOCATION> Laramore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> refused to identify the students, citing <ORGANIZATION> Denison </ORGANIZATION>'s privacy policy. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` profoundly disappointed at the shortsighted, insensitive and totally unsatisfactory decision by the board.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaskill </PERSON>, a sophomore and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the group met before the hearing and agreed not to accept any punshisment less than a year-long suspension for the students found guilty. `` I do n't expect an end,'' he said regarding the protest. `` I do expect an impact on the students to end apathy about racism on campus.''

<TEXT>
 Arab hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet killed a hostage today, then said they will shoot all the passengers, including three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family, if the plane is not refueled. The gunmen said the dead man, who was tossed out of the plane onto the tarmac, was a `` Kuwaiti officer.'' He was the second man killed by the hijackers, who hold nearly 50 people aboard the plane. Doctors said the side of the man's face was badly injured, possibly because of a beating. He had been shot at least once in the head. The hijackers warned they would take `` more dangerous steps'' if their demand for fuel was not met by Cypriot officials. They said they wanted to fly to a `` neutral country.'' More than three hours after the man's body was thrown out of the plane at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> airport, the hijackers put one of the passengers, identified as <PERSON> Fadl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzouk </PERSON> el-Oteibi, on the radio. Speaking in Arabic, he told the control tower: `` The hijackers say that if you do n't give us fuel they will kill all the passengers. `` Please listen to this and greetings to my family.'' The man's body was was thrown out of the jet at 3:07 p.m. -LRB- 8:07 a.m. EDT -RRB-, after Cypriot authorities did not comply with several demands that the aircraft be refueled. Half an hour later an ambulance headed toward the plane, picked up the body and took it to the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> morgue, where <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> photo stringer <PERSON> Takis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ioannides </PERSON> said the man was dead on arrival. `` We have executed a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officer,'' a hijacker told the control tower. `` We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.'' Kuwaiti officials had said three people with `` military status'' were on the plane. One of them, a 24-year-old Kuwaiti border guard, was killed Saturday in the first death in the weeklong ordeal. The hijackers had set two deadlines today for fuel. A 1 p.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. -RRB- deadline passed without incident after <PERSON> Malaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> office here, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Herodotou </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, conducted brief negotiations with the hijackers. The hijackers then set a 2:30 p.m. -LRB- 7:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- deadline and told the control tower refueling must start or `` you will receive the corpse.'' Fourty-seven minutes later, the man, identified by the hijackers as a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officer, was thrown out of the jet. In announcing the first deadline today, one of the gunmen told the control tower by radio: `` We hereby appeal to the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> government that we are intending to take off to a neutral country, therefore you are kindly requested within one hour to start refueling the craft. Otherwise, we kill a personality related to the unjust Kuwaiti regime.'' The hijackers have been demanding the release of 17 terrorists held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. But sources close to the negotiations said the hijackers today demanded freedom for the three men among the 17 terrorists who are sentenced to death. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> apparently rejected the modified demand. On Sunday, a pro-Iranian group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> threatened to kill American and French hostages if any attempt was made to storm the plane. A statement from the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> terrorist group was delivered to a news agency in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, along with photographs of journalists <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an American, and <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s large <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> royal family are among the 52 people believed to be aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, including at least half a dozen hooded hijackers armed with grenades and guns. The plane was hijacked Tuesday on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> carrying 112 people and forced down in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were freed. After the plane left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> refused to let it land. Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, apparently after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> intervention. One member of the royal family, <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, told the tower by radio Sunday evening in a faint voice: `` We depend on God for our fate.'' The other two royal family members are his sisters, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and Anware. Today marked the first time the hijackers had referred over the radio to any plan to fly to a `` neutral country.'' They did not name the country or say which of the royal family they planned to kill. However, the Kuwaiti newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Qabas </ORGANIZATION> reported that Algerian officials have become involved in the negotiations. At one point, the gunmen had threatened to take off and force the pilot to crash the jumbo jet into the emir's palace in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Sunday, the hijackers threatened to start a `` slow and quiet massacre'' of the 47 or so remaining hostages unless <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> released the pro-Iranian prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be a key factor in the negotiations. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> joined other Moslem leaders meeting on other issues in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in supporting <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s refusal to give in to the hijackers' demands. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, pro-government newspapers reported today that additional gunmen boarded the hijacked jetliner at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> airport and arms and ammunition also were supplied. Government statements have blamed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the fate of the hostages because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> allowed the plane to leave <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied involvement in the hijacking.

 Authorities on Monday ordered all cats and dogs leashed in order to stop an outbreak of rabies. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> imposed the order after a fox and dog died of rabies in the southeastern corner of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>.

Authorities also asked hunters in the area to concentrate on killing foxes, raccoons and badgers, as well as stray dogs and cats. Household pets can come down with the viral disease through contact with infected animals. People can be infected with rabies through animal bites. There were no reports of human cases in the outbreak.

Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Movie critic <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> pleaded guilty today to attempted state tax evasion charges in a dispute he blamed on a former accountant's advice. In an agreement with the state Attorney General's office, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> already had paid approximately $ 20,000 to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> to cover deliquent taxes, penalties and interest. ` It's ironic that this would happen on Academy Awards day,'' he said outside the court, adding that he did n't believe he would be able to get a flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in time for the awards. `` I'm going to miss seeing <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s navel,'' he said. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was his pick for best actress in the film `` Moonstruck.'' Appearing in <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, 49, entered a guilty plea on two misdemeanor counts of attempted tax evasion for failing to file state returns in 1984 and 1985 while employed as a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He was fined $ 2,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found that the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> as an independent contractor for 1984 and 1985, `` therefore he was earning income from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state employer, but had not filed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state returns,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> told reporters that since he lives in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> he should have filed nonresident tax forms but said an accountant he no longer retains told him that was n't necessary. State tax officials said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s primary address is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for 12 years, then worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until last year.

 A police raid on suspected drug dealers was conducted weeks ahead of schedule because a network television crew planned to show the suspects in a nationally televised documentary, officials said. The weekend sting resulted in 29 arrests, but one <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state trooper suffered a gunshot wound and two others were injured in a traffic accident. The alleged dealings near a shopping center were covered in just 25 seconds of Sunday night's hourlong <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> documentary titled `` Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON>, who originally was concerned that if the suspects saw themselves on TV they would flee, said after the show aired that the influence probably would have been minimal. `` These people were so blatant that they probably would have been back out there within a week,'' <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON> said. Saturday's raid focused on runners peddling crack cocaine shipped in from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, by Jamaican dealers, <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON> said. The suspects were using the rural county to cater to out-of-town buyers who `` did n't want to have to worry about the dangers'' of city crime, he said. The county is less than an hour's drive from suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. About 60 state and federal agents Saturday afternoon began serving arrest warrants on 40 people accused of distributing crack. A total of 29 arrests have been made, authorities said today, and more are pending. A national magazine article several weeks ago detailed a Jamaican drug connection to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and a television crew arrived shortly thereafter. <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON> said he offered to let the reporters do their work from unmarked police vehicles, but also asked that their pictures not be aired until the suspects were arrested. `` We were kind of concerned that if some of those people saw themselves on television, they would disappear,'' <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON> said. ABC News officials did n't hold off, however, and scheduled the special show for Sunday night, <PERSON> Kolibash </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravitz </PERSON> denied that the network was responsible for speeding up the drug arrests. `` My understanding is that they offered to move the date,'' she said. `` They volunteered to do that. It was n't anything we asked for.''

 A scholar was convicted today of transporting stolen historic documents, including letters from <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, that belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, 59, was charged with interstate transportation of stolen goods. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine when sentenced May 23. The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for about 2 -LCB- hours more today before returning the verdict. Mount, a respected biographer and former <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> fellow, insisted the documents he sold to a bookshop were his. Mount's public defender, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, said bookkeeping at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was too spotty to prove those institutions ever owned the documents in question. Mount was not charged with theft, although the government contended that he took the papers. In closing arguments Friday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> reiterated the government's claim that Mount stole the papers and removed their identifying marks. Mount was accused of selling to a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bookshop letters written by artist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> that belonged to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He was arrested while trying to sell letters and papers signed by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and some Civil War generals that allegedly were taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. Mount, who was born <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON>, claimed he bought the <LOCATION> Whistler </LOCATION> papers at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> shops in the 1950s and'60s, and that a priest in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, who has since died, gave him the Civil War papers in 1961. Mount, who favors a gray bowler hat, a British accent he attributes to neighbors in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and dapper suits from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said he was impoverished after the government seized his savings. During most of the trial he lodged at a YMCA. The defense noted that Mount over the years donated many of his papers to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He has written biographies of painters <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, and held a Guggenheim fellowship in 1956.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said Monday that 150,000 Iranian pilgrims would travel to Mecca this year and stage demonstrations against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. These intentions had been announced earlier this year by other Iranian officials but it was the first time that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 87-year-old spiritual leader has referred to them. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has said it will cut the number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but has not announced any figures. Last year 402 pilgrims, including 275 Iranians, were killed in riots that began with a rally against `` pagans'' in the holy city in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> during the hajj, or pilgrimage. Saudi officials said many pilgrims were trampled to death in a stampede or killed in subsequent street brawls that followed the demonstration. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed police mowed down the pilgrims with machine guns. After the violence last summer, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called for the overthrow of the ruling family in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, saying it was unfit to have custody of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, holy places of Islam. `` This year 150,000 pilgrims will participate in hajj rituals and the pilgrims will do their duty, which is disowning the infidels, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` It is not possible for our pilgrims to take part in the hajj and not demonstrate against world arrogance,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said. `` Basically, disowning the infidels is one of the political duties of pilgrims, and without it the hajj would not be the hajj.''

The spokesman also contended that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has not intended to harm the general population. `` They -LRB- the sanctions -RRB- were designed to strangle the financial system,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for alleged drug trafficking and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have insisted that he relinquish power and leave the country. In an effort to increase pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for the first time since invoking it against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two years ago. That action banned all trade with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The law prohibits payments _ including taxes _ by <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to the Panamanian government. One administration official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations would be affected. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the steps as attempting `` to deny <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ... money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power.'' `` We have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking and financial system of the country and not the general economy ... and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that constitute the base for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> staying in there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` There is serious damage being done, in terms of the financial system, but we think the banking system will be able to recover,'' he added. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he's optimistic that the new economic sanctions will force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power without permanently damaging the economy. `` We worry about the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> economy because what we've tried to do is take action that would not hurt the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in an interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program. `` We've tried to take action directed toward getting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down,'' added <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Asked if the administration is considering even sterner moves to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he believes the new sanctions `` will be effective.'' `` I think for the time being this is what should be done and we're optimistic about the results,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Panamanian assets in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks have been frozen since March, when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> take the action after deposed Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> obtained an injunction from a federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s executive order on Friday stopped short of a full economic embargo on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but violators can be prosecuted for non-compliance with administration policy for the first time since U.S.-Panama relations began to sour. Violators can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and $ 50,000 in fines.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, whose stylish touch with pop ballads led to hit songs in three decades, including `` Rainy Night in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' has died. He was 56. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> died Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immaculate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. His managers said today that he died of bacterial meningitis. His elegant baritone, backed by sweeping string arrangements, was especially popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1959 alone he had four top 20 hits: `` It's Just a Matter of Time,'' ` So Many Ways,'' `` Endlessly'' and `` Thank You Pretty Baby.'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who wrote many of his songs, sang several duets with <ORGANIZATION> Dinah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, two of which, `` Baby -LRB- You've Got What it Takes -RRB-'' and `` A Rockin' Good Way,'' were hits. His biggest hit, however, came with `` Rainy Night in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' a mournful tune that reached No. 4 on the Billboard pop chart in 1970. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peay </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lugoff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, began singing at an early age in the Methodist church choir in nearby <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, where his father was choir master. He started his career as a gospel singer. In recent years, he limited his performances to occasional nightclub appearances, which concentrated on his hits, among them `` The Boll Weevil Song,'' `` Think Twice,'' `` Revenge,'' `` <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>'' and `` For My Baby.'' `` It was <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s own idea to combine gospel intensity with lush pop arrangements,'' according to the `` Rolling Stone Record Guide,'' which described his singing as `` smooth and smoky.'' `` From rock to ballads to blues, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> never drops his easy elegance, yet the swirling strings do n't obscure his emotional intensity,'' said the record guide. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>; five children, and his mother, <PERSON> Maddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peay </PERSON> of Lugoff.

 A financier alleged to be the mastermind of some of the biggest political and financial scandals in postwar <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> was released from prison Monday because of a serious heart condition. <PERSON> Licio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> was extradited from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> less than two months ago to face charges of fraudulent bankruptcy in the 1982 collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION>. His release on `` provisional liberty'' was granted by <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> judges <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Brichetti </PERSON>. The frail, 68-year-old financier who once was <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most-wanted fugitive left the jail in this north Italian city with his son, <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> Lawyers said <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON>, former head of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s outlawed P-2 masonic lodge, will be hospitalized after a few days of rest at home. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> had fled <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1981, ahead of a police raid on his villa which uncovered links between the P-2 lodge and a ring of right-wing terrorism. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1983 for entering the country with false documents, but escaped from prison after a few months. Afer four years in hiding, <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> surrendered to a Swiss magistrate in September. He was extradited to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Feb. 17. The major scandal involving <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> was the $ 1.2 billion collapse of the Vatican-linked <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON> was a close associate of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvi </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosiano </ORGANIZATION> who was known as `` God's banker'' because of his links with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calvi </PERSON> was found hanged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> a few months after his bank collapse. <PERSON> Gelli </PERSON>, held in a maximum-security cell, decided last week to suspend all medical treatment to press his demand for provisional liberty.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and a Soviet government ministry announced Monday they had agreed on a multimillion-dollar venture to equip Soviet fertilizer plants with high-technology production control equipment. The deal was announced as a group of 400 Americans led by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> arrived for trade talks with Soviet officials. Prospects for more such joint projects, which the Soviets are promoting to help stimulate their economy, are a main topic for the talks of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertilizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> are forming a company that will design automated control systems for factories under the ministry's jurisdiction and is expected to sell to third countries as well, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. The Soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using the new technology, thereby also improving harvests in the weak farm economy. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> will own 49 percent of the company and the Soviet ministry will own 51 percent, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. The company has been named <PERSON> Sterch </PERSON>, after an endangered species of Siberian crane that was saved by U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the 1970s. A <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> statement said the company's investment in the initial marketing and design phase will be about $ 1 million. <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> told a news conference that once the joint venture begins installing the production control equipment, purchases from <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> `` could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 20 million volume'' in the first year of operation. Because the Soviet ruble can not be exchanged for hard currency, the method of receiving profits is a major problem for Western firms trying to set up joint ventures with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said that under Soviet legislation adopted in September, the minister of the Soviet fertilizer industry has access to some of the country's hard currency earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s future income from the project will depend on increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be marketed to third countries, and on installation in other countries of systems in plants that the Soviets have helped manage, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. Most of the joint venture's employees will be Soviets, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. The agreement will be signed Thursday and official registration of the company may take a month or more. <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prityko </PERSON>, a top official in the Soviet ministry, said <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s 10 years of experience with a similar <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> system was an important reason the Soviets chose the Minneapolis-based company. `` We just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are expected to hear from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks, although they could improve the climate for greater U.S.-Soviet trade. He said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only if the Soviets make improvements in other areas such as human rights and emigration.

 The needs of fish, power generation, irrigation and recreation hang in the balance as a major drought parches the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. If current conditions continue for another three years, the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says, the situation could be more severe than the drought preceding the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> winds 1,243 miles from its headwaters in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on the Oregon-Washington border. Millions of residents in four states rely on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and the region's other major river, the 1,038-mile-long Snake, for their livelihoods. Federal fish and power experts say that if the drought continues as expected into 1989, the river system could reach the breaking point. Few of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>'s 19 major reservoirs are expected to refill this summer, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, chief of reservoir operations for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. Even last year, one of the driest on record, was wet enough to fill the man-made lakes. When the rivers run below normal, managers representing Indian tribes, three states and the federal government must decide how to balance competing interests. Controlled flows guarantee safe passage during the annual fall and spring migrations of the salmon and steelhead prized by commercial, recreational and Indian fishermen. The water also spins turbines that light homes and power businesses throughout the region. In good years, the power flows as far as <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, cutting dependence on non-renewable sources of energy. Starting Friday, a fish migration plan developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> calls for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to flush immense volumes of water down the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and Snake rivers until June 15 for the benefit of spring and summer Chinook salmon smolt. Enough water is stored along the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for its young fish, but the Snake's flow will not meet this year's goals, according to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquet </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. To increase survival, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> plans to use trucks and barges to transport some of the young fish, a move that could avert problems faced in the years following the 1977 drought, when 90 percent of the smolt perished, damaging subsequent fish runs. The receding <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> system will reduce hydroelectric power generated at a series of dams throughout the basin. Reservoirs will be 70 percent to 80 percent full this year, according to <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, manager of system analysis and rates for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The council says the Northwest's power prospects for 1989 are `` uncertain.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> already has eliminated power sales to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It has bought power from sources outside the region for the first time in 15 years, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> BPA </ORGANIZATION>'s operations planning branch. For irrigators, the second year of drought has brought critical conditions to several localities, particularly the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, said severe shortages also could occur in southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, harming onion, seed and fruit crops. Water is less scarce in the potato-growing central areas of the state, he said. Recreational boaters also face problems because of low water levels in the reservoirs.

 Since 12-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> invented `` Give Peace A Chance,'' three years ago, she has played her board game against such world-class competitors as <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` I always lost,'' she admits cheerfully. But then, winning is not the point of the game, which tries to educate players about global relations. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> invented `` Give Peace A Chance'' three years ago as a project for her third-grade class. It's a simple board game similar to Monopoly. Players use small markers that carry a nation's flag, and they are rewarded for cooperation with other countries. Winners create nuclear free zones, share scientific secrets and invite children's peace delegations to their countries. Losers invade smaller countries or refuse to negotiate treaties. The game includes a version of the `` Go Directly to Jail'' card, but with an apocalyptic twist: `` Nuclear warfare between countries. Game is over for all countries.'' But the fallout from `` Give Peace A Chance'' has been all positive for <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>. After her game won first place in the 1985 International Children's Peace Prize competition, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> was selected for a world tour sponsored by Children As Peace Makers Foundation. Last week, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON>, left on her second `` peace mission'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where her game is being translated into Russian. The Soviet-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventions </ORGANIZATION> is paying for the trip, during which <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> hopes to play her game with Soviet children. After that, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> will receive the World Children's Day Foundation Award at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on April 24, then address children delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. `` Almost all children have a hobby and do something that they really want. I really want world peace. It's a hobby of mine,'' she said in an interview before she left for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> has played her game with <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, the former Soviet foreign minister, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, Chinese Vice President <PERSON> Ulanhu </PERSON> and Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. `` Older people can learn things from children. That's what we're trying to tell them _ we want to grow up and we want to live,'' she said `` Give Peace and Chance'' helps teach children and adults alike that `` there are consequences to our actions, both good and bad,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. One part of the game asks players to create a peaceful activity with another country, but Mrs. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said children have an easier time creating hostile or aggressive acts against their neighbors. One of the most touching moments in her travels, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> recalled, came when a girl from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> that the children's peace delegation had toured <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> by bus and had seen other children in the streets with their arms outstretched, pleading for food and money. The girl asked how <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> could allow his country to spend so much money building nuclear weapons while children begged for food in the streets. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> -RRB- said, ` We're doing everything we can.' And then everybody was crying. There was n't a dry eye in the room,'' she said.

<HEAD>State Attorney General Won't File Charges Against Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state attorney general's office today said it would not file charges against <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police officers accused of perjury or excessive force in connection with a case that raised allegations of racism and brutality. A report issued today concludes an eight-month investigation into the case involving <PERSON> Sagon </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, a black who was acquitted in the killing of one white police officer and the wounding of another. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> claimed he was defending himself against a racially motivated attack when he grabbed one of the officer's guns and opened fire in the March 31, 1985, incident. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> was killed and <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and civilian observer <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina-Ruiz </PERSON> were wounded. The state attorney general's investigation arose out allegations made by Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, who presided over <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s second trial. The judge's public remarks came shortly after <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> was acquitted in the retrial that ended July 16, 1987. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said police officers lied on the witness stand and suggested that <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> engaged in `` nightstick justice,'' provoking the struggle that ensued after a traffic stop. State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence to support successful prosecution. He also said <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> had made it clear he did n't want any charges filed against <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> was at first reluctant to be interviewed by state investigators, who interviewed him March 12 only after an immunity agreement was worked out. During the questioning, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> was unresponsive to many questions and drifted off into other subjects such as religion and philosophy, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. Describing <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> as a troubled man, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said he did n't think <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> would have made a credible witness and that his testimony would have been crucial to a successful prosecution The perjury allegations stemmed from testimony given by several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police officers regarding the police investigation and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' character, which was described by the defense as bigoted. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said that criminal perjury requires a very high standard of proof. He said the prosecution has to prove that a witness knowingly gave false testimony in regard to a central issue of the case. `` After careful investigation of eight incidents of possible perjury, our lawyers concluded that there was either no evidence or insufficient evidence to meet that very high standard,'' the attorney general said. Another key issue was the possible use of excessive force. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said there was substantial evidence that officers used excessive force at the beginning and at the end of the confrontation. But he said there was no evidence to sustain a charge of battery against <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>. `` As to Agent <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, the decision was much more difficult. The most consistent accounts from eyewitnesses suggest that <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> did use excessive force, both at the beginning of the incident and after <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> was on the ground.'' But because there were conflicting accounts among eyewitnesses, without coherent testimony from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, the state could n't sustain a battery charge against <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, he said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration expressed firm support Monday for the refusal by <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> officials to comply with a demand by the hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet that the aircraft be refueled. Department spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s decision not to abide by the hijackers' demand for the release of 17 convicted terrorists in that country. `` The hijackers are murderers trying to free other convicted murderers,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` They must be punished.

The second victim, killed on Monday, was identified as a `` Kuwaiti officer.'' He was thrown out of the plane onto the tarmac at the airport in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> also dismissed as `` cynical'' a threat by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to kill the hostages they are holding if any harm comes to the hijackers. `` We continue to hold the kidnapers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fully responsible for the safety and well being of all the hostages there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Interior Department Postpones Offerings of Offshore Oil and Gas
Leases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A heavy workload has forced the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to postpone seven planned offerings of offshore oil and gas leases in 1989, 1990 and 1991, the department said today. Four are in federal waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, two off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one off the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> postponements are in the <LOCATION> Navarin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, from January 1989 to December 1989; the <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, from December 1989 to September 1991; the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, from May 1990 to October 1990; and the <LOCATION> Navarin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, from September 1991 to June 1992. The two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> postponements, announced last week by members of that state's congressional delegation, are off <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, from September 1989 to January 1990; and off <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, from November 1990 to March 1991. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> offering postponed from October 1989 to December 1989 is for waters from roughly the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island-Massachusetts </LOCATION> border to a bit south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Staff problems and work overloads,'' was how <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimberger </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, described the reasons for the changes. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> postponements were made necessary by a heavy volume of comments for a lease offering off northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scheduled for next February, she said. The new schedule shows 34 remaining offerings under the five-year drilling plan adopted last July, reflecting the dropping of the June 1992 offering off the eastern coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under an agreement with the state announced in March.

 Israeli police and soldiers swept into southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and arrested dozens of drug traffickers suspected of smuggling heroin and hashish into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, police said Monday. The unusual raid Sunday night was aimed at checking a growing cross-border drug trade and narcotics addiction in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the officials said Lebanese sources said more than 100 Israeli police with dogs detained 65 drug traffickers in three villages north of the border, <PERSON> Bint </PERSON> <PERSON> Jbeil </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Klaia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION>, and confiscated nearly nine pounds of heroin and cocaine and 110 pounds of hashish.

<HEAD>Eight Maryland Students Must Undergo Random Drug Tests in First
Use of Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> students who were caught using illegal drugs must submit to random urine tests for three semesters in the first use of the school's drug-testing policy The policy, implemented at the start of the spring semester in late January, is believed to be the first at a major university to require random urine testing for students found using drugs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marijuana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laws </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> NORML </ORGANIZATION>. The alternative for students caught with drugs is suspension. The testing program is opposed by some students, who regard it as an invasion of privacy, unduly harsh and potentially damaging to a student's future. They also say it is an unjustified backlash to the 1986 cocaine death of campus basketball star <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Bias </PERSON>. Students held a rally last month in protest, and one student group has collected 800 signatures on petitions opposing the policy. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, vice chancellor for student affairs, acknowledged that the policy did evolve after Bias' death in June 1986. `` But the implication that the university is in a position to do this only in response to public outcry is incorrect,'' he said. `` We have had a very thorough discussion of our options to deal with this very difficult issue of drugs. This solution evolved from that very careful and extended study.'' Campus officials say they are open to students' suggestions on how to improve the policy, but believe it is fair, especially as it offers a way for offending students to stay in school provided they pass the tests. Under the policy, students caught using or possessing illegal drugs on campus must appear before a hearing board and face either drug testing or suspension, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavela </PERSON>, director of judicial programs at the university. The student can appeal the decision to a campuswide committee of students and faculty members, he said. `` All the cases so far involve marijuana. And all the individuals involved reported that their use is casual,'' <PERSON> Pavela </PERSON> said. `` They have made commitments to us that they will discontinue the use of drugs, and in return, we have committed ourselves to minimizing the drug testing'' to a period of three semesters. `` I feel they -LRB- the administrators -RRB- are overstepping their boundary lines,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Joski </PERSON>, who helped form a student group called Stand Up For Your Rights. `` We do n't need a ` big brother' over our head. And this is what they're doing with the drug testing. They're just way out of line.'' Instead, the group has called for additional drug education and counseling on campus. Stand Up For Your Rights is especially opposed to drug testing for first offenders, <PERSON> Joski </PERSON> said. `` Just think, you're a freshman. You get caught. You do n't have a chance to repent what you did. You automatically have the cuffs slapped on you _ you have to go through drug testing,'' he said. `` A lot of Fortune 500 companies wo n't take you if they see that on your record. Basically, your whole career could be shot.'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gettman </PERSON>, the national director of <ORGANIZATION> NORML </ORGANIZATION>, argued it is unfair to determine a student's continued enrollment on the basis of urine tests. `` These students really have a disincentive to achieve because no matter what they achieve, it is this test, and this test alone, that will pass judgment on their worthiness to be enrolled at the university,'' <PERSON> Gettman </PERSON> said. `` No matter what they do, no matter how well they excel in any field _ academic, athletic, campus activities _ nothing can offset the damage of getting a positive urinalysis reading.'' <PERSON> Pavela </PERSON> said, however, `` I do n't think the fact that one might be a great cheerleader or great student government representative ought to offset the repeated violation of an important regulation.'' Enrollment this semester at the College Park campus, including undergraduates and graduate students, both full and part time, is 35,442, the school said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese officials will hold immigration talks this week and likely discuss <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s plan to accept within two years all children remaining in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that were fathered by American servicemen, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Monday. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the negotiations also will cover additional Vietnamese immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since 1980, 64,000 Vietnamese have gone to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In January, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agreed in principle to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s offer to resettle within two years the estimated 8,000-12 ,000 Amerasians and up to 22,000 close relatives remaining in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said the children suffer prejudice in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which American troops left in 1973. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beardsley </PERSON>, head of the embassy's refugee office in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, will join the talks in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. `` A prime focus of the talks with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> will be the Amerasian program, and consequently ... the two-year program is likely to be discussed,'' <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. The proposal is based on recent legislation that reclassfied Amerasians as immigrants rather than refugees, a change likely to hasten resettlement. Since 1980, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accepted more than 4,000 Amerasians under a U.N.-sponsored program. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suspended its participation from January 1986 until September 1987, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to streamline procedures. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said Thursday that the Americans were `` lazy'' in taking the children and he would like them to go even quicker than two years. `` We have told them they can take them all tomorrow,'' he said. The resettlement program was established in 1980 as an alternative to the flight of refugees in boats. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said in the latest round of interviews, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had screened about 1,000 Amerasians and relatives, and 1,000 other Vietnamese.

 Pilots and flight engineers of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, the largest French domestic airline, began a three-day strike Monday, but company officials said most flights went off as scheduled. The strike is one in a series to protest <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to fly the new <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320 aircraft with only two cockpit crew members instead of three. The first A320 is scheduled to go into service with <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> in June on the Paris-Grenoble line. The personnel have conducted a series of strikes since Feb. 16, but until Monday had limited the action to the morning hours, from midnight until 8 a.m., and exempting Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. According to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, 80 percent of the flights went off because it used non-striking crews and leased planes from other companies. Since the company made its decision in November 1985 to fly its A320s with only pilot and co-pilot, the personnel have claimed that it would be unsafe. Under that system, the flight engineer's navigating equipment is installed in front of the pilot and co-pilot The A320 was conceived and certified for flight by a two-member crew. The smaller crew also means lower operating costs. Union members on Monday denounced the lack of negotiations between the union and the company.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to topple Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have caused `` serious damage'' to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy, but it will bounce back, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman predicted Monday <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said U.S.-imposed sanctions `` were designed to strangle the financial system'' of the Central American nation but not harm the general population. The spokesman was asked to respond to assertions by leading Panamanians that the past weeks of financial turmoil have crippled the country's once-flourishing economic system, perhaps forever. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency, had become known as a stable and reliable banking center in both North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But the financial system has been nearly paralyzed since March, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze $ 50 million in <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government funds in American banks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> step followed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON>, who is still recognized by the administration as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president. In an effort to increase pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last Friday invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The law prohibits payments _ including taxes _ by <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to the Panamanian government. One administration official estimated last week that roughly 40 to 50 subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations would be affected. The taxes are to be paid to an account opened for deposed President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the steps as attempting `` to deny <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ... money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power.'' `` We have tried to design those sanctions to affect the banking and financial system of the country and not the general economy ... and tried to minimize damage to the general public and general economy while at the same time attacking the points of power that constitute the base for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> staying in there,'' he said. `` We do n't think it is irreparable harm ... there is serious damage being done, in terms of the financial system, but we think the banking system will be able to recover,'' he added. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> contended that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steps have been effective, even though <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not yet stepped down. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> heads <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and is the power behind the civilian government. In February, two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug-trafficking charges.

Violators can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and $ 50,000 in fines.

<HEAD>Residents Fear Five-lane Road Will Crush Town's Heritage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EATONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan to expand a two-lane road to five lanes has sparked fears that it would destroy the residential heritage of the nation's first incorporated black community. Residents of the 100-year-old community are worried that the county's plan would threaten the city's history. The Association to Preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Eatonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and two private citizens joined in a class-action suit in March against <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>. The group opposes a 1.3-mile highway which would replace a two-lane road through the two-square-mile town's commercial and civic center. The road also would cut through a neighborhood in nearby <LOCATION> Maitland </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think they're paying proper attention to what <LOCATION> Eatonville </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON> have done to preserve the residential nature of our cities,'' said <PERSON> Germaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvel </PERSON>, a member of the preservation group. `` This is <LOCATION> Eatonville </LOCATION>'s main street. This is where the schools, the grocery stores, the churches in this little town are located,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, an attorney for the group, said the lawsuit is novel because it says the public need for roads is outweighed by the greater need to preserve a historically unique town and to balance transportation improvements with existing neighborhoods. County commissioners say central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is growing so rapidly that something must be done to prevent future traffic jams. They also think the road could help <LOCATION> Eatonville </LOCATION>. `` It could move commercial interests and increase thair tax base,'' aid <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON>, chairman of the board of commissioners. But most residents do n't want the road. `` Everyone knows this is a community-busting road,'' said <PERSON> N.Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathiri </PERSON>, who heads the association against the road-widening. `` You'll have a nonexistent or nonfunctioning black community.''

 If he had to handle offshore oil and gas sales all over again, he'd do it differently by starting with all possible areas up for leasing, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told an industry audience Monday. `` I would recommend to my successor when he puts together the next five-year -LRB- drilling -RRB- plan, that he ought not to exclude areas from the plan as I did,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association represents oil companies operating offshore and their suppliers. Plans drawn up by former Secretaries <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did not rule out any offshore areas from the start, relying on procedural steps at later stages to drop unsuitable areas. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> noted that in drawing up the current plan, which took effect last July, he excluded several environmentally sensitive areas off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast such as Big Sur in the hope of `` eliminating arguments over areas not seriously part of anyone's future drilling objectives. `` But, instead, what I accomplished was what a friend of mine calls ` pre-emptive capitulation,''' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` My current view, based upon this experience, is that there must be some quid pro quo _ such as that provided by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in our recent negotiations on the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Shelf.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> agreed last month that areas off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> keys would not be offered for leasing under the current plan, something <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and many <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> environmentalists wanted and something that was easy for <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> to grant because there is believed to be little oil or gas there. In exchange, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> agreed to drop out of a multi-state legal challenge to the five-year drilling plan, and not to oppose the offer of certain tracts off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sale was omitted from a revised schedule of 34 offerings that saw seven lease auctions delayed several months in 1989, 1990 and 1991 because of the pressure of work _ four in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, one off the mid-Atlantic states and two off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday.

 An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> grandmother hiking to awaken the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to the plight of abused and neglected children completed her 500-mile, three-week trek Monday in the nation's capital Wearing shorts, a T-shirt and jogging shoes, a smiling <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> strode briskly up to the foot of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol, triggering cheers from supporters who had gathered to welcome her. `` Let me catch my breath, everybody,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` It was hard. It was full of blisters and joint pain and back pain and sunburn and windburn and cars trying to run me down ...'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, spokeswoman for a group called Rights of Our Children, said she does not regret making the journey. `` I have made this walk to awaken the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' she said. `` If everyone will just look and see the pain and the destruction that's happening to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children, they will search their hearts and do something about it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> refused to disclose her age, but said she has a 10-year-old grandson. She left <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on March 21 and hiked through <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> before reaching <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She said she has been `` powerwalking'' for about four years and averaged about 23 miles a day during her trip. `` I'm so exhausted that I do n't sleep,'' she said. `` I get about four hours' of sleep a night.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, followed Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> in a car during the first part of the journey and maintained contact with her throughout the trip. She said Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> stayed overnight in the homes or campers of friends and that there were a few `` campout situations.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuehner </PERSON> said her friend walked virtually the entire way, taking rides only for a few miles on stretches of dangerous highway. Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said the most frightening part of the trip occurred in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> when she was forced to hug the side of a mountain to avoid being struck by a semitrailer carrying a wide-load cargo. `` I dug my toes literally into the side of the culvert against the stone ... and prayed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> recalled. `` I felt the whiz of it go across my back.'' She said she was disappointed she was not able to meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but that she hopes her walk will spawn legislation to better protect children.

<HEAD>Paramedic Starts Program To Prepare Emergency Workers For The Worst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> will never forget the sight of a 19-year-old bride killed in an auto crash and pinned in her car in her bloodied white wedding gown. It was several years ago, but the memory of that accident, which occurred when the newlyweds' car crashed into a pickup truck, helped lead <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> paramedic, to create a program to help other paramedics, firefighters and police cope with the tragedies they encounter. In a series of group discussions, called crisis debriefings, rescuers share their feelings and thoughts about serious accidents, fires and other disasters and deaths. `` It gets people's feelings off their chests, so they are not feeling it weeks or months later,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardester </PERSON>, emergency medical services coordinator in <LOCATION> Maitland </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Law enforcement officials view themselves and are viewed by the citizens as a different kind of people. If you see a firefighter crying, you would think: ` Hey, what's wrong with him? It's part of the job. If you ca n't take it, get out.' But they are not robots. We are all human beings. We have feelings.'' It's important for emergency workers to vent their feelings or they later could suffer from serious stress reactions, such as depression, irritability, confusion, withdrawal and cardiac disease, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who worked as a paramedic-firefighter for nine years and holds a doctorate in psychology. A debriefing session usually is scheduled one day after a tragedy. The rescue workers gather with a specially trained psychologist and with peers, who act as unbiased supporters. The workers discuss how the incident affected them and how to cope with the stress. And if the session is successful, they also learn that their feelings are not unique, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has spoken throughout the country about his program, trains debriefing teams while also working as assistant professor of emergency health services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>. Cities and counties across the country use his methods, but only eight states, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, have coordinated statewide programs. <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was the first in the state to organize a debriefing team of emergency workers from most area police and fire departments. The team now serves four other counties _ <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. A 15-member regional board composed of agency chiefs coordinates the program in the five counties. They call debriefings for traumatic events, such as deaths or serious injuries to children or co-workers. Since March 1987, the team has scheduled 13 debriefings, including one after a gunman killed six people and injured 28 in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> last April. <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON> paramedic <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Neisler </PERSON> wishes the program had been available for her a few years ago when she worked on a case in which a <PERSON> Maitland </PERSON> man killed his young son, then killed himself and set his apartment on fire. The boy looked like <PERSON> Neisler </PERSON>'s nephew. She spent a night in a hospital wracked by nausea and finally became dehydrated as a result. `` I tried to go back and deal with it myself, but basically I did n't deal with it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Senate Shows Support for Budget Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> showed support Monday for a $ 1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget built to comply with deficit-reduction promises while increasing spending for the AIDS fight, the space program and education. The spending plan cleared an initial parliamentary hurdle 83-0, and debate began at the earliest date in years. Although the law allows 50 hours of debate time, a final vote was considered possible by Tuesday. The smoothness of the process did n't stop an undercurrent of concern and frustration that the election-year plan was n't doing enough about the deficit. `` We're running just a few steps in front of the avalanche of death,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> But given current political constraints, he said, the best the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could do was `` make sure that next year's burden grows no larger. The estimated deficit of $ 136 billion would meet the mandate of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. But it represents only a modest reduction in red ink from the $ 146.7 billion predicted for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to `` do much better in the years to come,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, who is retiring after this year. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the budget committee's senior Republican, drafted the budget in compliance with last fall's deficit agreement between congressional leaders and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The pact set overall spending guidelines and took away what is usually the biggest point of contention _ the balance between domestic and military spending. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget proposes for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 294.0 billion next year. Domestic agencies would spend $ 169.2 billion, while foreign aid would total $ 16.1 billion. The agreement also pre-determined that no new taxes would be included in the budget plan, beyond the $ 14 billion in new taxes enacted last December. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did in adopting its budget last month, was using the administration's optimistic assumptions about the nation's economy. The non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> predicts a deficit some $ 35 billion above the Gramm-Rudman target. Within the overall guidelines of last fall's agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal re-arranges some domestic priorities that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed when he submitted his budget in February. While many domestic agencies will face belt-tightening to absorb inflationary costs, the budget rejects the president's call for eliminating several domestic development and mass-transit programs. It also rejects his request for tightening up in the Medicare system. The deficit-reduction agreement did not cover Social Security or most other benefit programs and none of this year's budget plans has envisioned cuts in those areas The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budgets, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal, call for big spending increases on the space program, research on AIDS, education and air traffic safety. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan also endorses <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to give a 4.3 percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for civilian federal workers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted a 3 percent across-the-board raise. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must settle on a single budget resolution before it becomes final. The budget resolution is a guideline for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' fiscal legislation, and it does not require the president's signature.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Monday that he is not in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state but that some sort of temporary autonomy could be tested on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` I support the Camp David formula, which points us toward a period of limited autonomy, during which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> would be able to judge what autonomy is like in practice,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` Now the exact formula must be arrived at by the parties themselves.'' Those parties include <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> `` and perhaps <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> told reporters during a question-and-answer session in the board room at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Whatever happens, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, `` it's unthinkable to have an armed, military, hostile presence so close'' to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s borders. `` I think that the eventual formula has to involve assurances that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security will not incur an additional threat,'' said the Democratic presidential aspirant from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was in town campaigning for the delegate-rich April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. Two hundred fifty-five delegates are at stake for the three remaining Democrats: <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is far behind the other two in the delegate count. Before talking to reporters, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> addressed leaders from the securities industry in the stock exchange board room. During a wide-ranging session with reporters later, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said that he was glad <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seemed to distance himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and that he always thought Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> was not a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that if he were elected president he would not meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for being too close to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and was asked by reporters Monday if he took credit for what he termed `` a very useful statement'' from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` No, I'm not taking credit for that. He deserves credit for it,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` But by raising the issues openly instead of just behind the scenes I think it makes it a healthy process and creates opportunities for questions and answers that break new ground.'' The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator added that `` I think that one of the purposes that can be served by drawing contrasts in a primary campaign is by making it possible for candidates to more clearly ... elaborate their positions. I know I have grown during this campaign. I know the other candidates have.'' Also during the weekend, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the correct interpretation of statements he has made is that he would n't accept a nomination draft if one were offered at the Democratic convention next July. `` He has encouraged people to look favorably at all the active candidates,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I never thought he was a candidate because he told me he was n't a candidate.''

<TEXT>
 Despite the need to keep the entrance channel to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> free for submarine passage, the federal government is taking the slow route in dredging the waterway in order to protect endangered sea turtles. Federal officials have hired a team of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> zoologists to study turtle populations at different times of the year to guide future channel dredging, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorndal </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Archie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turtle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the university. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> to use only the safest dredging method to avoid harming the turtles, she said. The Corps would like to use hopper dredging, which sucks up sediment with a tremendous hydraulic force, Ms. <PERSON> Bjorndal </PERSON> said Monday. `` The problem is that the sea turtles get sucked up too and torn into pieces,'' she said. The alternative is clam-shell dredging, in which a large bucket slowly scoops up sediment. `` While our work is basic research, it has a great effect on potential management and conservation decisions,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolten </PERSON>, one of the researchers who catch, tag, measure and determine the species and sex of each turtle. The turtles are returned to the water within 30 minutes of their capture. `` A two-day study does n't give you enough information because of the dynamics of sea turtle distribution,'' <PERSON> Bolten </PERSON> said. `` A number of years of data need to be collected for a bigger picture.'' The team did one survey of the channel last month and plans return trips in May and September.

He was fined $ 2,000 and must pay $ 50 in court costs. <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> had already paid approximately $ 20,000 in delinquent taxes, penalties and interest to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's ironic that this would happen on Academy Awards day,'' he said afterward, adding that he would miss attending the ceremony in person because he could n't get a flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> in time, and would have to settle for watching it on television. `` I'll miss <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s navel,'' he quipped. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found that the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> as an independent contractor for 1984 and 1985, `` therefore he was earning income from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state employer, but had not filed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state returns,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he could have avoided the $ 2,000 fine if he were to prove that he was a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> resident during 1984 and 1985, but he did n't want to face the prolonged legal battle. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said it was easier for him to `` give them their pound of flesh for two thousand bucks.'' Tax officials said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s primary address was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who currently appears on the television show `` At The Movies,'' worked as a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until last year. He was also a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> for 12 years before writing for the Post.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, hailing the `` valiant struggle of the Afghan people,'' announced today that he will send Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to sign the accord ending the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` I believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can now join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a guarantor of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> instruments,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of the accord, which opens the way for the pullout of the 115,000-man <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and a return of millions of Afghan refugees to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the proposed pact `` would provide for the complete withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces from that country.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the signing ceremony, which is expected to be held Thursday. `` This development would not have been possible had it not been for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country of foreign occupation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding, `` We take great pride in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can count on our continued support.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also lauded <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for its role as a home to millions of Afghan refugees during the period of Soviet domination of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s announcement that beginning May 15, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with 50 percent of the forces removed over a three-month period. All remaining Soviet forces are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. He said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead of the deadline. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` push for that and expect that.'' While hailing the agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` The withdrawal of Soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter.'' Negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim government. `` We know it's not easy, it will be hard,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Underscoring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pledge of continued aid for the U.S.-backed rebels, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` We have stood by the Afghan people during this 8 -LCB- years and we're prepared to stand by them in the coming months to help Afghans return home and begin rebuild their lives and their country.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> trip gives him another chance to meet with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> before talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week to continue preparations for the superpower summit meeting in the Soviet capital beginning May 29. Prior to the announcement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reported to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> talks last week with Arab and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders, which failed to produce a breakthrough to negotiations. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> vowed to find the time to return and to continue his effort. Setting the tone for the coming summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Sunday he looks forward to the signing of an agreement providing for the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` If that accord is complied with, and Soviets withdraw irrevocably from that long-suffering country, this will be a great victory for its heroic people,'' he said at a broadcasters' convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` It will also be a major contribution to the improvement of East-West relations. However, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> economy remains in trouble and he does n't know how the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be able to compete in a changing world marked by new technologies. `` ... Nations will have to grant to their scientists complete freedom of inquiry; to their businessmen and entrepreneurs, freedom to invest, to risk, to create new products and with them new markets,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` The Soviets and their clients must open their countries to ever-wider freedoms. Or they will see their economies _ indeed their whole way of life _ fall further behind,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made only a passing reference to the agreement reached in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the pullout of the Soviets' 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We're very optimistic, but nothing has been signed yet,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters. The agreement is to be signed Thursday. The president's top aides continued planning for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, vacationed the past 10 days at their mountaintop ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. They returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday. The May 29-June 2 summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is seen by many as the likely capstone to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spending much of the rest of the year on the 1988 political campaign trail. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted that the summit will come almost a year after he flew to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to demand that the Soviets destroy the Berlin Wall. `` As I challenged him in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> before the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -LRB- superpower -RRB- summit, I challenge Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> here today, before the summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, to tear down this other wall, this grim, invisible wall of oppression,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while headway has been made on emigration, people-to-people exchanges between Americans and Russians and his own access to Soviet television, much more needs to be done. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also called on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to work for more openness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries for Western authors, journalists and broadcasters.

<HEAD>Soviet Condemns Guerrilla Attack on Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet television on Monday condemned Afghan guerrillas for shooting down a Soviet-built passenger jet with 29 people aboard after announcements that a negotiated end to the 10-year-old Afghan war is near. The national news program `` Vremya'' showed wreckage strewn over a valley near the Afghan city of <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION>, about 90 miles south of the Soviet border. A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency commentary blamed the attack on the leaders of the `` <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> Seven,'' the main guerrilla organization based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It accused the leaders of prolonging the bloodshed at a time when Afghans were inspired by recent news from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the fighting will cease and 115,000 Soviet soldiers will go home. An Afghan air force colonel told <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Stinger missile had been used to down the plane carrying both government soldiers and civilians. `` This act is especially cynical because it was committed when all Afghan people were inspired by the joint Soviet-Afghan statement by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>,'' said the colonel, identified only as <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>, referring to Thursday's announcement by the Soviet and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leaders that all obstacles had been removed to the signing of a peace accord. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said guerrilla alliance leader <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmeyar </PERSON> vowed to carry on the armed fight, and that the insurgents had `` already shot down several civilian planes and the number of those killed amounted to almost 200.'' It was not clear over how long a period of time the casualties were inflicted. `` The leaders of the insurgents are unwilling to listen to the voice of reason and to join the settlement process,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s call for insurgents to lay down their arms and join his government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have announced agreement on a package of measures to end the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s army, backed by about 115,000 Soviet soldiers, and guerrilla forces based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and armed primarily by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The negotiated peace plan is to be signed on Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where indirect talks moderated by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> have been under way since 1983. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> plan, Soviet troops will begin leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 and at least half will be out within three months. The remainder would be obligated to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within 10 months of the start of the pullout, but Soviet officials have indicated they plan to have their soldiers home by the end of this year. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to act as guarantors of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement under a plan worked out behind the scenes that would ensure `` symmetry'' in continued aid to the warring sides. Afghan negotiators had insisted on an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons deliveries to the guerrillas once the Soviet pullout began, but American observers at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks refused to abide by it unless the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> stopped arming <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops. Soviet officials deemed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand an infringement of its right to enter into bilateral agreements with a sovereign neighbor and initially refused the `` symmetry'' plan. But diplomatic and official sources have reported in recent days that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have worked out an agreement ensuring a balance in aid or a moratorium on arms shipments to the warring sides. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that insurgents attacked <LOCATION> Maimaneh </LOCATION>, killing 13 people and causing serious damage.

<HEAD>Criminal Penalties Proposed For Fraud In Scientific Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee member raised the possibility Monday of imposing criminal penalties against scientists who deliberately falsify their research, but several whistleblowers protested that such a solution would be excessively harsh. The suggestion of a federal statute making scientific fraud or misconduct a criminal offense was made by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., at a hearing of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations `` Why are scientists in a different position from anyone else who acts against the public interest?'' demanded <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who also is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your point is an excellent one, and it makes me squirm,'' replied <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a nerve cell researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> who is a part-time investigator of scientific misconduct in the research community. But <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and a colleague, Dr. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, expressed concern that the threat of criminal penalties might create a damaging climate of fear among scientists. Two private whistleblowers, Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Urbana-Champaign </ORGANIZATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON> of the graduate hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, both said <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' idea was `` going too far.'' <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> waged a nearly four-year effort to call attention to scientific fraud committed by Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuning </PERSON>, who used a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> for research into drug treatment of mentally retarded patients. <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON> blew the whistle on Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borer </PERSON>, a cardiologist and professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, for allegedly inducing a medical student to make numerous misrepresentations in a report of their scientific study. <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> expressed interest when the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, suggested that one solution might be to create an anti-fraud watchdog organization within the scientific community. `` It is not a question of too many watchdogs,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` We seem to have no watchdogs at all in this situation.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> complained that neither the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, universities where research financed by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> grants is conducted, nor the professional scientific societies has shown a willingness to guard against fraudulent research. `` You ca n't have it both ways,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said, expressing sympathy with <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' suggestion for criminal penalties. `` We ca n't have a continuation of flagrant abuses and say no one can be held accountable because it might hurt morale.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> that scientific fraud threatens `` incredible harm and injury to the public,'' but expressed optimism that scientists will find a way to police themselves without federal intervention. Replied Conyers: `` The whole point of criminal laws is to deter.'' <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON> said extreme forms of scientific fraud, such as wholesale fabrication of research data, is `` fairly rare.'' But he estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of research papers contain unethically flawed results. `` The whole climate just fosters this generally feeling that everyone does it,'' he said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, who testified jointly, said they have talked to `` considerably more than 20 scientists who have alleged misconduct to us privately,'' but have been reluctant to make formal charges through the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy. `` Their reluctance strongly suggests to us that the reported cases of misconduct represent only a small fraction of the total,'' they said. Based on questions raised by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> has formed a special committee to investigate allegations that research data was misrepresented in a paper published by Nobel laureate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and by <PERSON> Therza </PERSON> <PERSON> Imanishi-Kari </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research in cellular biology, said last week that he welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said he hoped it would silence <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, who he said had `` acted like a judge and jury'' in the case.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested Monday that American Jews should vote for him rather than a Democrat because `` I'm a good friend of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comment as he spoke to reporters during a tour of an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> office here during a day of low-key campaigning.

Witnesses saw burning trucks Sunday near the depot bearing Afghan license plates. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a conduit for foreign military supplies and other aid to the Afghan insurgents fighting the communist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> backed by an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who disclosed the number of dead and injured, received messages of sympathy from various heads of state, including a message from Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` I wish to convey our deepest condolences to the families who suffered from this tragic incident and to all people of the republic of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s message as saying. Streets in the two cities were littered with an estimated 6,500 unexploded anti-tank mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and other devices. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Obee </PERSON> said the embassy had offered the Pakistani government help in finding and clearing the weapons. A four-man American explosives expert team arrived Sunday night from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Task Force in northern Arabian Sea. <PERSON> Obee </PERSON> said the team would also clear ammunition that fell in 10 to 12 residences of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employees. There were no injuries or major damage, he added. He said the team began its work Monday and will continue as long as needed. He stressed that the Americans would not investigate the blast. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> said seven Pakistani soldiers were killed and 32 injured in the explosion. On Monday, he toured the areas around the blast site and visited hospitals to talk with the wounded. Police and army patrolled the streets and some people began repairing their houses. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> radio and neighborhood mosques appealed for missing people. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> said the injured and the families of the bereaved will be compensated and ordered an enquiry into the cause of the explosion. He also said all ammunition depots situated within populated areas will be shifted to safer and isolated places. Some Western embassies said they received anonymous telephone calls warning of a terrorist bombing shortly before the depot blew up at about 10 a.m. <PERSON> Obee </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> did not receive such a call. Shortly before the explosion, a small group of Moslem fundamentalists were preparing to march toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to protest against Israeli action against the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, two people were killed and at least 100 others injured Monday when police clashed with mobs of students who tried to close shops in northern <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state to show sympathy for the victims of the weekend explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported that the injured included 70 policemen. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars, two of them over <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An American judge on the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should step aside in its dispute with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official argued before the world court that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ducking its international responsibility by trying to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. The diplomatic tug-of-war stems from anti-terrorist legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December. The law classifies the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group and bars it from operating on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has tried to use the law to close the 14-year-old mission with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer status. In Monday's 90-minute session of the world court, American Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwebel </PERSON> challenged a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> claim that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration moves constitute an immediate threat to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would wait for a ruling from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and he said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should do the same. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> has asked the judge to rule in favor of the closure in a case initially brought by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has asked the world court to issue an opinion against such a closure, which has been denounced by all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says the dispute should be arbitrated by a special, three-member panel. The world court, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial arm, lacks legal powers to enforce its decisions and can only issue advisory opinions. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Carl-August </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said Monday that the American move to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office violates a 1947 agreement between the international organization and the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says that accord, which guarantees the unimpeded functioning of diplomats accredited to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, also applies to missions with observer status. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was granted permanent observer status at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and has maintained an office near <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> ever since. In a brief released by the court Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> stated `` the question at issue goes far beyond the particular dispute and has far-reaching consequences for the ... discharge of the responsibilities of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the world at large.'' The court asked <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s undersecretary-general for legal affairs, to respond in writing to its queries later this week. <PERSON> Fleischhauer </PERSON> told reporters Monday he expected a decision by the end of May. There were no representatives of either the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration or the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> at the world court on Monday.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Covers Any Flight Over Two Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The airline smoking ban that goes into effect April 23 on commercial aircraft will apply to any flight scheduled for two hours or less even if delays cause the flight to take longer, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the smoking ban on short flights in legislation last year. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued its final rules on the prohibition Monday, although the general outline of the new restrictions has been known for months. Airlines since the first of the year have complied with a state law in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and banned smoking on flights within the state. The law enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year prohibits smoking on any flight of two hours or less on jet aircraft as well as smaller commuter planes. Charter flights and those involving travel clubs are exempt from the rules. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, clarifying details of the restrictions, said Monday that the length of the flight shall be determined by the elapsed time shown for the flight in the Official Airline Guide. Should a flight be delayed so it takes longer than two hours, the ban still is in effect, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The ban also will apply to each segment of a flight. For example a flight that has three legs of 90 minutes, 90 minutes and 2 -LCB- hours would require that smoking be prohibited in the first two segments and allowed in the final segment, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. According to the rules, flight attendants must remind passengers of the smoking ban during pre-flight briefings. A passenger who violates the ban would face a civil fine of up to $ 1,000 per offense. Any passenger who tampers with a smoke detector in an aircraft lavatory and tries to smoke could face a fine of up to $ 2,000.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> told a gathering of the world's religious leaders and lawmakers on Monday that environmental and political problems have imperiled the Earth. `` We are confronted by problems which transcend national and credal boundaries, which are urgent and potentially terminal, and which require not less than a global solution,'' the archbishop told the conference, which is debating global problems. `` We live in a world society which desperately seeks some measure of world community in order to survive,'' said <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the spiritual head of the state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and leader of 70 million Anglicans worldwide. In an apparent reference to the plight of hostages in the hijacked Kuwaiti airliner in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said one crisis that had to be solved was the `` terrorism which fouls and feeds on global communciation.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> took part in the opening of the five-day Global Conference of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival. Earlier Monday, the organizers said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pulled out of the meeting, expressing displeasure at the attendance of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibetan Buddhism. The conference is a gathering of the leaders of the world's major religions and elected lawmakers and is aimed at putting their influence to work on solving dilemmas such as over-population and poverty In a message of good wishes to the conference, Indian's Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said, `` Those who guide the destinies of spiritual affairs and those who forge the destinies of nations must share the same vision for the betterment of humanity.'' About the pulling out of the Chinese, the Very Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, a co-chairman of the conference, said: `` We worked hard to get the Chinese here because we are discussing issues of great concern to them, like population growth.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the leaders of the world's most populous nation had earlier shown a willingness to attend the conference. `` But although we had no formal complaint from the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government about the attendance of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, we did get a letter from one of their bigwigs saying they were not coming because he was here,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959 after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> invaded his country and has criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policies in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is one of a dozen main speakers at the conference. On Tuesday he will address the conference on the universal human condition. He will not attend other sessions of the gathering, which ends Friday. About 200 people from 60 countries in East and West, including the Communist bloc, are attending the conference, with the five main religions of Buddhism, Christianity, <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, Islam and Judaism strongly represented. The meeting, apparently the first such religious-political gathering, will discuss how the participants will work together to influence crucial issues, which also include terrorism, urban violence, pollution, conservation and education.

 Farmers, utilities and fish and game officials will be fighting over limited water supplies this summer as a major drought parches the West. `` That's the big concern, the juggling act with water,'' said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a fish biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Wildlife in Central Point. `` There are so many interests in water, what might be best for one interest may not be best for another interest.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> quit selling power to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last fall to make up for a drop in electricity produced by hydroelectric dams on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> system. But the big victims of the drought will be farmers, ranchers and fish, said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is severe on the fish and irrigation side, not the power side.'' In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> already has declared a drought after noting snowpack and reservoir levels were approaching the lows that preceded the drought of 1976-77. `` We've had a critical premature die-off of range land, and lots of water districts are cutting back on farm water allotments,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The snowpack in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> averages 35 percent of normal, forcing some ranchers to sell cattle and appeal for federal grain subsidies as pastures dry up. `` It's scary. It's really scary,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marr </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tuolumne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, which is considering rationing. The West is n't alone. In the Southeast, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> are facing their fourth serious drought in eight years, with some reservoirs at lower levels than they were at this point in the drought years of 1981, 1986 and 1987, officials said earlier this month. `` If we do n't get a dramatic increase in rainfall, we'll be looking at water restrictions this summer,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Word </PERSON>, chief of water resource management for the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, snowpack and rainfall figures range from near-normal in the northwestern part of the state to 36 percent of normal in the south. Ranchers in southeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> are trucking water to their cattle as water holes dry up, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Lakeview </LOCATION>. Irrigation water will be in short supply for orchards, hopyards, vineyards and livestock around <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on the drier eastern slopes of the Cascades. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, however, unusually heavy rain and snow in March relieved fears of a second year of rationing. Reservoirs are up to 94 percent of normal. The outlook is grim in the region's forests, which were heavily scarred by fires last summer. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, where 110,000 acres burned, already has started its fire season. `` Drought conditions do n't guarantee a bad season,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, who oversees southwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they certainly elevate the potential.'' Timber companies worked feverishly over the winter and spring to stockpile logs. `` Companies are concerned that we'll have another serious fire season and they'll be locked out of the woods again,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, timber staff coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Last summer, officials limited logging in high danger areas of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife is particularly worried about a disease called furunculosis killing off thousands of chinook salmon on their spawning run up southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Low flows mean warmer water, which promote the growth of the bacteria, said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. Low water also makes it tougher for fish to swim up rapids and falls, bottling them up in crowded pools where the bacteria is more readily spread. Starting Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is to flush immense volumes of water down the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and Snake rivers to help young salmon smolts migrate to the ocean. It also plans to use trucks and barges to carry many smolts around dams, where they can be killed by hydroelectric turbines or spillway torrents. The <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is facing the prospect of less hydroelectricity from the dams on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` If we have to buy hydropower from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or if we have to fire up the coal plants in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which are far more expensive than our hydropower, we are likely to see some rate increases,'' said council spokeswoman <PERSON> Dulcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahar </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Unit To Be Formed To Protect Cambodians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is forming a new military unit to protect <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugees after complaints that a paramilitary task force had robbed, raped and killed refugees, an officer said Monday. Col. <PERSON> Sanam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajornklam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>'s Operations Division said the <ORGANIZATION> Displaced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> would be operating on the Thai-Cambodian border by the end of June. <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said international organizations and Western countries that contribute to the Thai refugee relief effort had voiced concern about abuses by <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 80, which since 1980 has been in charge of security for a quarter million Cambodians in camps along the border. The Cambodians fled brutal regimes, food shortages and a guerrilla war in their homeland. The Western officials `` were concerned and said they would like to see improvements,'' <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said. `` We also wanted to see changes and are responding to that.'' `` By improving our people and increasing our responsibilities, we will be able to provide better security to those inside the camps,'' <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said. He said the army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, and the armed forces chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Sundhara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kongsompong </PERSON>, concluded in October that the paramilitary must be `` upgraded and staffed with people with caliber.'' The new unit, comprising 560 defense volunteers, is to work together with the army and <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 80, <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, voluntary organizations, and the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> were among those who complained about the task force. In an influential report issued in February 1987, a delegation from the New York-based lawyers' committee said that its tour of the border area found `` an alarming incidence'' of abuse by the task force rangers. `` Rangers have robbed, beaten and raped the residents of some camps, with apparent impunity,'' the report said. `` The rangers' conduct has generated an atmosphere of fear even among those who have not been personally victimized. The rangers also have killed some refugees, the report said. One of the most publicized incidents took place in March 1986, when three task force officers reportedly used a hot iron and burning firewood to torture three Cambodians in the <LOCATION> Khao-I-Dang </LOCATION> refugee camp, which is aided by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The Cambodian men were suspected of an armed raid on the camp. Thai government officials then denied there had been any torture. Western aid officials working on the border say that there have been fewer reported abuses by task force rangers in recent months.

<HEAD>FTC Reinstates Complaint That Cigarette Ad Was Deceptive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Monday revived a complaint that an <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> advertisement in 1985 misrepresented the results of a government study on the effects of smoking on health. In a 4-1 vote, the commission reversed a ruling made last August by an administrative law judge who had dismissed the complaint on grounds that the ad was an editorial and therefore was protected by First Amendment guarantees on freedom of speech. Under Monday's <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> order, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON>, the administrative law judge who dismissed the complaint, must reconsider his ruling in light of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> criteria on determining whether an advertisement is protected by the First Amendment, said <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. <PERSON> Hyun </PERSON> must determine whether the five-member commission has jurisdiction in the case, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> staff, in its original complaint filed in June 1986, charged that <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> made false or misleading statements in an advertisement, `` Of Cigarettes and Science,'' which ran from March 1985 to June 1985 by stating that the study, `` provided credible scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as the public or the reader has been led to believe.'' The study, called Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, or MR FIT, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint was based in part on the fact that `` <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> failed to disclose in the ad that men in the study who quit smoking had a significantly lower rate of death from heart disease than men who continued to smoke,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. `` We charged that omission of that information made the ad deceptive.'' If the case is decided against <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>, the commission could bar the tobacco company from misrepresenting scientific studies but could not seek monetary penalties, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said. The company views it as a freedom of speech case. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, an attorney representing <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, said the company `` denies that it misrepresented the study. But the basic issue here is who should decide that, the government or the public as whole.'' `` This advertisement is, in our view, protected by the same First Amendment rights as if it were written by anyone in the world,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said that although <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has not yet had a chance to review the entire ruling, it will consider all its legal options, including a possible appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, or asking the commission to stay further proceedings on issue. Remanding to the case to the administrative law judge, said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, `` is unneccesary and in flat violation of the First Amendment. One would not ask the writer or an op-ed piece why he wrote it.'' <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> cast the single dissenting vote on the case, agreeing with <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> that `` it is critical for First Amendment purposes that the public, and not the government, decide the answer to this question.'' The Coalition on Smoking or Health, which had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to rule against the ad, applauded the new <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ruling. Coalition chairman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballin </PERSON> said the decision means `` the federal government has the power to prevent <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> or any company with commerical motives from deliberately misleading consumers about the safety of its products by discussing a made-up scientific controversy through advertisements that look like editorials.'' The coalition comprises the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, sells 20 brands of cigarettes and accounts for about one-third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette market, according to company statistics.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday directed Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to sign `` historic accords'' by which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will guarantee a peace agreement dictating the removal of all <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the pact a `` triumph'' for the U.S.-backed insurgents after a bloody, eight-year war with the Soviet-supported <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. He said the rebels `` can count on our continued support.'' The rebels have rejected the peace pact and have vowed to continue fighting. Under a compromise with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue sending weapons to the rebels, while the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> continues providing arms to the Marxist government. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the announcement in the sun-splashed Rose Garden before a ceremony to congratulate the mens' and womens' <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> basketball champions. `` This is the first time in the history of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to withdraw,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said later at a White House press briefing. The peace settlement, negotiated between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, is to be signed on Thursday. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged that the removal of Soviet troops will not necessarily mean an end to the fighting. Once the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is withdrawn, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` then the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have got to work things out. That's their right and their problem. ... Perhaps we can get to a period of at least relative stability.'' In the Rose Garden, a reporter shouted to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the rebels feel they are being sold out by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will not be bound by the accord. `` We are not,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied. Beginning May 15, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to begin withdrawing its 115,000 troops, with 50 percent of the forces removed over a three-month period. All remaining Soviet forces are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead of the deadline. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` push for that and expect that.'' While hailing the agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` the withdrawal of Soviet troops is obviously not the end of the matter.'' Negotiations will continue for the establishment of an interim government. `` We know it's not easy, it will be hard,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help the rebels `` as needed.'' But on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, denounced the agreement as amounting to a `` slow-motion-sellout'' of the resistance fighters. `` It's a poor deal, a very bad deal,'' he said. `` The Soviets are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist puppet regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> just as lavishly as they please,'' while denying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to resupply the Afghan rebels. The accord calls for the return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of millions of Afghan refugees, most of whom moved to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from outside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, by the millions,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` So, there will be immense social dislocation and potential for suffering, and we and others in the international community will want to do everything we can to ease that transition,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged the appointment of a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> coordinator to oversee the repatriation. `` In our view, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, having inflicted so much suffering on the Afghan people, have a special obligation to provide resources for this resettlement,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Underscoring <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s pledge of continued aid for the rebels, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` we have stood by the Afghan people during this 8 -LCB- years and we're prepared to stand by them in the coming months to help Afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their country.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the announcement after being briefed by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on details of the agreement. `` I believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can now join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a guarantor of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> instruments,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I have therefore asked Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to represent us at a signing ceremony for the historic accords. ... `` This development would not have been possible had it not been for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country of foreign occupation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We take great pride in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can count on our continued support.''

 The world's oldest Olympic champion last saw his two medals nearly 60 years ago. Somehow, says <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON>, the gold and silver medals got misplaced and were never found. But this week, <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON>, 95, who ran in the 1912 <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> games and was the roommate of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, will get duplicates of the medals from the great-grandson of the man who presented him with the originals. King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is to present <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON> with the specially crafted medals Thursday during a visit to <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON>, a member of the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fitness </ORGANIZATION>, came up with the idea of replacing the original medals after taking <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON> home from an Olympic fund-raising event in February. `` We were driving and my wife said, ` <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, where are your Olympic medals?' He said, ` To tell you the truth, I have n't seen them in almost 60 years,''' <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said. `` I knew the king and queen were coming here and I thought, ` Would n't it be great if we could get replacement medals to give to <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>?''' <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said. Within 10 days of contacting <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> had <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>'s approval and copies of the medals in hand. The duplicates were made by a Swiss company using the same molds from which the 1912 medals were cast. The International Olympic Committee picked up the cost. How the originals were lost is not entirely clear. <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON>, who was not available for an interview Monday afternoon, told <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> that his family `` just misplaced them,'' possibly during a move to a new home, <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> said. In the 1912 Olympics, <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON> won the silver medal in the 1,500-meter run and the gold medal in the 3,000-meter cross-country event <PERSON> Kiviat </PERSON> later worked as a court clerk in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> before retiring. He now lives in the central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION> and makes occasional appearances to generate support for amateur athletics. `` We felt replacing <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>'s medals would be a fitting gesture to thank him for the support he has given the governor's council,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougan </PERSON>, executive director of the physical fitness council.

 An ambitious plan to make <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> the first state to guarantee affordable child care for every child under 14 was unveiled Monday, although its sponsor said he did n't know how it would be funded. `` We are in the midst of a child-care crisis,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, co-chairman of a special child-care commission. `` It is a crisis which affects our children, our families and our economy.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, chief sponsor of the bill to create a cabinet-level Executive Office of Child Care to oversee and expand current child-care services, said three out of five <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> children need child care because both their parents work or they have a single parent who works. Currently, the state is providing services to about 80,000 children at an annual cost of $ 110 million, primarily through subsidies to the poor, he said. But <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said conservative estimates point to another 80,000 children whose families can not find child-care services and 80,000 more whose parents ca n't find services at a price they can afford. `` This crisis will only grow in the future,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, joined by other child care advocates, told a statehouse news conference. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s bill does n't say exactly how or when the state will meet these needs. The measure would create a 21-member, gubernatorially appointed advisory commission to counsel the child care secretary on how to accomplish the mandate. He said the proposal could double or triple current state spending on child-care programs, but added, `` The only thing that will be more expensive is not providing universal child care. Without it, we may find that our economic boom will go bust.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration has taken no position on the proposal, which now goes before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Asked what the administration's initial reaction was, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` Well, they broke out in a rash.'' But he said the administration has n't dismissed the idea.

 Police searched Monday for a murder suspect who drove off in a prisoner transport van after his guards went into a convenience store and left the keys in the ignition. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Letner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, charged in the torture-murder of nurse <PERSON> Ivon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontbriant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, kicked out a passenger-door window in the back of the van and drove away in handcuffs Sunday afternoon, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Letner </PERSON>, 27, drove about a block before using the keys to unlock his shackles and then fleeing on foot. The suspect, who was captured in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and was being returned to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was one of nine prisoners in the van. Interstate Extraditions of <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was transporting the men across the country. The private firm uses former law enforcement officers to ferry 3,000 prisoners a year. `` I would certainly consider him very dangerous in light of the escape and because the information from the -LRB- murder -RRB- case alludes to that,'' <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Letner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuczek </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extraditions </ORGANIZATION>, said the prisoner van was en route to <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, before going on to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but came to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to make four more prisoner pickup stops in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. He declined to say if the two guards, with more than 20 years combined law enforcement experience between them, would be disciplined. `` Our procedures indicate that one of the officers should be with the vehicle at all times and that the keys should not be left in the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Kuczek </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- officers -RRB- were saying that they were hot and needed air and the prisoners wanted the air conditioner to be left on. `` Letner must have been quite an acrobat. We have never had an escape like that,'' he added. Shortly after the guards went into the store, <PERSON> Letner </PERSON> kicked out a rear window and managed to drive the van about a block. He then used other keys on the ring to unlock his handcuffs and shackles, before abandoning the van, authorities said. None of the other prisoners left the van. Helicopters and dogs were used to search for Letner on Sunday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, and an all-points bulletin was issued with <PERSON> Letner </PERSON>'s description Ms. <PERSON> Pontbriant </PERSON>'s body was found March 2 in her apartment with a telephone cord wrapped around her neck and several stab wounds, authorities said. Earlier that morning, <PERSON> Letner </PERSON> and another suspect, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>, 26, had been found in the woman's car, but officials did not know about the killing, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said. About 20 hours later, authorities learned about the slaying and linked <PERSON> Letner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> to the killing, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said. The suspects were arrested March 29 in Council Bluffs, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said. Two <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> police officers went to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to pickup the prisoners, but because of restrictions allowing only one prisoner per flight, only <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said.

 The most detailed assessment of the nation's business schools in nearly 30 years found widespread complacency, poor planning and a lack of contact with the business world But the 372-page report, released Monday at a national convention of business schools, drew immediate fire from deans and corporate officials who said the report did n't go far enough in addressing social and ethical issues, including minority recruitment. `` While both corporate and academic leaders believe business schools are performing reasonably well at present, they are in danger of drifting casually toward the 21st century, without careful thought and strategic planning about the roles their graduates will play in the changing world of business,'' the study said. It chided schools for preaching long-term planning in the corporate world, but doing little planning themselves beyond the next semester. Businesses, for their part, `` typically feel they can safely ignore most business school research with impunity,'' the report said. The report, `` Management Education and Development: Drift or Thrust into the 21st Century,'' was commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, an accrediting body whose 254 member schools award about 55 percent of all business degrees awarded annually. The report was compiled by <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibbin </PERSON> after a three-year study of the nation's business schools. The researchers interviewed deans, professors, placement directors and others on 60 campuses, as well as chief executives, college recruiters and those responsible for executive development from 50 private-sector organizations. In addition, the data includes results from 10,000 extensive questionnaires mailed to a similar audience. `` I was disappointed that after three years of work, the politics of an organization this large seems to have watered down everything,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblum </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>'s graduate school of business. `` It just was n't strong enough,'' he added. `` I think one could have left with the impression that we really are all right. I do n't think we're all right. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, said the report could not answer all the concerns of the business or educational communities. But after the research was complete, he said he was pleased to see how well the corporations thought of the preparations for their employees. `` The reactions from the business community were more positive than we had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McKibbin </PERSON>, a professor of management at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` When we went in we expected to be tongue-lashed by our colleagues in he corporate world,'' <PERSON> McKibbin </PERSON> said. `` That did n't happen at all. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, said the report failed to address `` the diversity of our work force. We're looking very carefully at things like the minority enrollments in business colleges and other social issues. Our company and many major firms are very concerned about these things.'' The report concluded business schools were lax in forecasting and meeting future trends in the business community. `` Complacency and self-satisfaction appear to be the dominant attitudes in many schools,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKibbin </PERSON> reported. `` There is little perceived need for major changes in the way in which collegiate management education is carried out.'' `` This is our opportunity to see that and change our complacency,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, dean of the business school at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` This could be the single, most important factor coming out of the study.'' Since the last major study of business schools in 1959 by <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> business Professor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, the number of bachelor's degrees in business increased from 50,000 to about 250,000 in 1985, and master's degrees increased from 5,000 to 60,000. The study cites the need for improved communication between business and business schools, greater program diversity among the schools, more varied and generalized curriculum at each school and greater planning for life-long executive education. Corporations surveyed seemed reasonably satisfied with the job business schools are doing preparing future employees. But the report said `` managers and executives would like to see more ` realistic, practical, hands-on' education with greater emphasis on behaviorally oriented subject matter in the curriculum and the development of ` people' skills.'''

<HEAD>Writers Bellow And Terkel Talk To Radio Audience In Kiev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authors <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> talked Monday about a familiar topic, writers and writing, but to an unfamiliar audience _ a big chunk of their listeners will tune in on radios in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The topic was `` glasnost'' _ the new policy of openness promoted by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ and how writers might help foster greater understanding between their two countries. The program, originating live on public radio <ORGANIZATION> WBEZ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with panelists commenting by telephone from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, was recorded for broadcast sometime later this week in that city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. `` I think we can say the Cold War days have basically had it,'' said <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, the Chicago-based author and interviewer known for such books as `` Working'' and `` The Good War.'' `` I'm happy to say that a recent poll ... revealed that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people think drugs is the biggest fear and not communism. It shows there is more curiosity than antipathy when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is mentioned today,'' he said. Panelists in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lauded the more tolerant attitude towards art and artists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Alexi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON>, chief correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kiev </ORGANIZATION>, opened the 75-minute program with an apology to <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON>, the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist whose works have not been ranslated into Russian. `` I can say the ice has already melted in many ways ... Yet, it is very sad that such distinguished writers as Mr. <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> are not available at this time,'' <PERSON> Gubenko </PERSON> said. `` I met Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recently,'' <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> said, `` but I did n't get a chance to ask him about it.'' On a more serious note, <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> noted that proposed cultural exchanges of the past had promised more than they'd delivered. The author of `` The Adventures of Augie March,'' and most recently, `` More Die of Heartbreak,'' added he hoped `` that would n't be the case with glasnost.'' Soviet writer and critic <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> that the profusion of literary journals in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> alone, and the freedom to publish works that had been banned for years, suggested glasnost would lead to fundamental changes in Soviet life. ` Indeed, we said too many sweet words about our past reality,'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said through a translator. `` The problems have been raised, the problems are many, but at last they are being discussed.''

<HEAD>Improved Soybean Exports Lifting Market Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Improved soybean exports are helping lift market prices this season, an Agriculture Department analysis showed Monday. Drought has damaged <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean crop, and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has increased its demand for the oilseed, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. That has helped whittle down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpiles and boost prices. The supply-and-demand report said soybean prices now could average in the range of $ 5.50 to $ 5.80 per bushel in the marketing year that began last Sept. 1, up from $ 5.35 to $ 5.75 forecast in March. Prices averaged $ 4.78 per bushel in the 1986-87 season. Soybean exports were forecast at 785 million bushels, up from 760 million indicated last month and the 757 million bushels shipped in 1986-87. Wheat exports also have improved, due mainly to subsidized sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. In all, exports in the wheat marketing year that runs through May 31 are estimated at 1.6 billion bushels, a 60 percent increase from 1 billion bushels shipped in 1986-87. Average market prices for this season were put at $ 2.55 per bushel, up from $ 2.42 last year. Corn exports also are up, rising to an estimated 1.7 billion bushels in the corn marketing year that began last Sept. 1, compared with 1.5 billion bushels in 1986-87. Market prices of corn were forecast to average $ 1.65 to $ 1.85 per bushel this season, up from $ 1.50 in 1986-87.

<HEAD>Private Gifts To Colleges Surge To Record $8.5 Billion In 1986-87</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Private gifts to the nation's colleges and universities rose a record $ 1.1 billion to $ 8.5 billion in 1986-87, boosted by a sharp increase in alumni contributions, according to an annual survey. For the second straight year, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was the most successful fund-raiser with $ 198.5 million, topping <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> which raised $ 178 million. The 1986-87 survey results gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> to Education were projected from data reported by 1,174 colleges and universities which together account for about 85 percent of all private giving to higher education. Council president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haire </PERSON> said several factors explain the unusual rise in contributions. The percentage of the population with four years or more of college doubled since 1970, meaning more people were in a position to give. Colleges were more aggressive in making their case for donations, <PERSON> Haire </PERSON> added. And the stock market was still booming in 1986-87. Among the survey findings: _ Support from all sources reached $ 8.5 billion, up 14.9 percent from the $ 7.4 billion raised in 1985-86 _ Alumni donations showed the largest year-to-year increase, up 28.5 percent to $ 2.34 billion Among other donor groups, non-alumni individuals contributed $ 2.06 billion, up 16 percent; corporations gave $ 1.8 billion, up $ 6.9 percent; foundations gave $ 1.5 billion, up 11 percent; religious organizations donated $ 204 million, a 3.3 percent decrease, and contributions from other sources rose 6.6 percent to $ 552 million. _ Following Stanford and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, other top fund-raisers were <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 149.7 million; <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 120.1 million; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, $ 116.3 million; <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> -RRB-, $ 110.4 million; <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 104.6 million; <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, $ 101.4 million; <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, $ 92.6 million; and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, $ 91.2 million

 Arab-American supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> splintered bitterly Monday over the Democratic presidential hopeful's latest comments on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, with one group asking why he had chosen to `` abandon your principles.'' `` Your comments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have the appearance of tailoring your positions on critical issues to suit the narrow political views of powerful special interest groups,'' said <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a letter to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said suggestions that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has shifted are `` grossly exaggerating'' what happened. `` One ca n't erase a nine-year commitment to Palestinian rights and to peace and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians in just one day,'' <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> said in a statement issued by his office. `` Arab-Americans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and across the nation are strongly committed to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign.''

On Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> seemed to distance himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and he said that, as president, he would not sit down with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` We must not equate <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> with a sovereign people, the Palestinian people,'' he said. Asked on Monday to expand that stand, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements. That's a formula for catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> said in his letter that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is pandering to Jewish voters in the April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. `` On behalf of tens of thousands of Arab-Americans, I wish to express my sadness that you felt the need to abandon your principles in your campaign for public office,'' <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> wrote. `` Virtually every Arab-American looked to you as the one symbol of strength in a field of political candidates who are notorious for their unwillingness to stand up to the pro-Israel lobby.'' In particular, <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the spokesman for the Palestinians. `` You know full well that virtually all Palestinians regard the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as their sole legitimate representative,'' he said. `` Your attempts to distinguish the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from the Palestinian people will not improve your position with Jewish voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but will, sadly, raise questions among your traditional supporters as to your willingess to stand firm on principle.''

<TEXT>
 Spice imports totaled about $ 439 million last year, up 12 percent from 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The rise was due mainly to larger imports of vanilla beans, white pepper, nutmeg and mace, cassia, cumin, anise, capsicum peppers, laurel and thyme, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Higher prices of many of the items also were a factor. `` Saffron prices have soared in recent months, reflecting a short Spanish crop,'' the report said. Also, it added, cesium contamination from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s nuclear mishap at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> two years ago `` has kept supplies tight and prices firm for several Mediterranean-area herbs such as oregano, laurel, rosemary and sage.

 Water districts will cut farm water allotments. Ranchers are trucking water to cattle, selling stock and appealing for federal grain subsidies as pastures and water holes dry up.

 The region's forests, already heavily scarred by fires last summer, are bracing for fire season.

 A bacterial disease called furunculosis could kill thousands of spring chinook salmon on their spawning run up southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Low water flows mean higher water temperatures, which promote the growth of the bacteria. Low water also makes it tougher for the fish to swim up rapids and falls, bottling them up in crowded pools where the bacteria is more readily spread.

<HEAD>Tree May Help Prevent Production of Cancer-Causing Food Toxin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists are looking at the neem tree of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a possible source of material to prevent the formation of aflatoxin, a naturally occurring food toxin, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that form on some farm crops, including corn and oilseeds. Laboratory tests with animals have shown that aflatoxin is among the most powerful cancer-causing agents known, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has called it a `` potential'' hazard to humans. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Deepak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> said that as a child in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> his parents often put leaves of the neem tree inside containers of wheat to keep insects from the grain. Now he has found that the leaves also may block fungi from producing aflatoxin. In tests at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> made solutions containing neem leaves. He found that the solutions did n't kill the fungi but did block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would have produced. The fungi that produce the toxin are Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> said the results were `` promising but preliminary'' and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned. The ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim. More than 80 insect pests, including Mexican bean beetles, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetles, tobacco budworms and carpet beetles, are repelled by neem extracts.

<TEXT>
 An experimental program using herbicides to destroy coca plants is bringing good results and may prove a major weapon against cocaine trafficking, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Monday. `` <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been one of the leaders in the use of herbicides for eradicating coca plants. We have been cooperating with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in these experimental studies,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said at a news conference. He later flew to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the last stop on his weeklong tour of Latin American countries where drug trafficking is a major problem. His three-day visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> will include a trip to the cocaine-producing lowlands of the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION> region. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he agreed with Peruvian officials that no herbicide should be used on a large scale if it causes ecological damage. `` Early results have indicated the development of a herbicide that does not harm other plants,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, without providing details. The pilot project using herbicides may eventually replace the system of manually uprooting the plants. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is paying for the experiment. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on Saturday and toured the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on Sunday. The valley, located on the jungle-cloaked eastern slopes of the Andes, is the center of coca leaf growing in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials say more than 60 percent of the world's coca is grown in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. In the past year the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group, has agreed to protect cocaine traffickers in the valley in exchange for a share of the drug barons' multimillion dollar earnings. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> flew low over the valley to observe coca plots, and officials traveling with him said he expressed amazement at the number of clandestine airstrips and jungle clearings where coca grows. Peruvian anti-drug police have blown up more than 170 airstrips since 1985, but most have been repaired in a matter of days by drug traffickers. More than 250,000 Peruvians live by growing coca and processing the leaves into semi-refined cocaine. The coca paste is refined into pure cocaine in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and smuggled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> began his tour in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> last Wednesday and visited <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> before arriving in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> asked his longtime friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, if he was interested in taking a key <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departent </ORGANIZATION> post a week or so before being notified formally that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was under criminal investigation in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, a lawyer for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> conducted job talks concerning the then-vacant post of counselor to the attorney general in `` limited discussions held in late March or early April'' 1987, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recalls that he was clearly interested in having <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> at that time come into the department, but that no formal offer was ever advanced to him,'' <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said. The arrangement between the two men was that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had to make some decisions about what he wanted to do, whether he was interested in'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position, said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was `` to get back'' to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. But that never took place because the criminal investigation of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> intervened. The $ 77,500-a-year job of counselor is a position traditionally held by one of the most trusted advisers to an attorney general. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said he does not know whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> or <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> initiated the job talks or how many there were. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is on a trip to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this week and was not immediately available for comment. Around April 8, 1987, the attorney general was notified formally under an administrative mechanism involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had become a subject of the criminal investigation into scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> characterized as `` ridiculous, unbelievable'' suggestions by columnists <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had considered the idea of bringing <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> into the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` to be a live possibility'' until last December when <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal `` When Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was told that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had become a subject of the investigation in April, that intervening event terminated essentially any substantive discussions of any kind'' between the two men, <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> considered installing <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on an advisory commission of outside experts in 1985 to examine the administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and suggest possible changes. The commission, apparently the idea of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, was never created. The counselor's job was vacant after <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cribb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s inner circle of conservative advisers, went to the White House early in March 1987 to handle the transition of incoming chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cribb </PERSON> is now assistant to the president for domestic affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counselor's post was filled last May 18 by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, head of the department's civil rights division. After being notified officially in early April that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer and longtime friend, was under investigation, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> removed himself from involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> inquiry, which was being conducted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s investigation had been under way since the previous fall amid widespread public attention to the fact that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had done work for the company. It was common knowledge at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late in 1986 that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who had received $ 1.3 million from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, would shortly become the focus of criminal investigators. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said, however, that `` as of the time of these discussions with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, it was Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s understanding that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s role in the investigation was simply as a witness.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` had no reason to believe that Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had been engaged in any kind of impropriety'' in late March or early April 1987, said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. A federal grand jury which indicted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> alleged that he and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial manager, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, had funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor in an attempt to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials to help the company. Rocap represents <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in the 11-month-old criminal investigation of the attorney general's involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and other matters, including a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> represented one of the partners. At <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s behest, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> when he was White House counselor intervened on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in its efforts to win a $ 32 million no-bid contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> got the contract in 1982 after a crucial White House meeting called by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s deputy. At a trial last October of two <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> politicians stemming from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive and government witness, testified that he had illegally paid advances to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in 1985 in anticipation that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> would take a top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post. `` In one occasion he -LRB- <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> -RRB- told me that he would become the attorney general's chief of staff and that therefore we should make certain payments ahead of time so that while he was there he would continue to help the company,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified, saying that there were several such payments to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.

<HEAD>More Than 2,000 Chinese Students Sign Letter Opposing Education
Policy Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 2,000 Chinese studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> have signed a letter to their government opposing a plan to cut the number of students abroad, a student organizer said Monday. The letter, which was a revised version of a petition prepared two weeks ago, was delivered to Chinese officials on Sunday. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the letter was an `` inappropriate'' way to express discontent. He denied that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of sending students abroad would change. According to official reports in the Chinese press and a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> document seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will let 3,000 students leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this year. Of them, 600 will be sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last year, 8,000 Chinese students came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone. In all, 40,000 Chinese students are studying worldwide, about 27,000 of them in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The embassy spokesman on Monday confirmed the existence of the document but said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` using it only as a test.'' `` We may change this document after using it for a couple of months,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said the new policy was aimed at limiting the West's influence on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The students' letter urged the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government to continue <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` open door'' policy, started by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in 1979. The policy seeks to improve <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy by opening it to the West. The letter also demanded that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens be given the `` fundamental right'' to study wherever they wish for as long as they wish. `` The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseas study are fundamentally in conflict with the declared national policy of reform and open door,'' the letter said. A Chinese student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 2,132 Chinese students from 141 research institutions and universities in 38 American states had signed the letter. Several students from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also signed the petition, he said, although he did not specify the number. Of the signatories, 1,279 provided their real names, an act Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> described as `` courageous.'' `` The students could be subject to reprisals once they return home,'' she said. `` They could lose good jobs, even their relatives could suffer.'' The letter marked the second time Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have banded together to oppose policy changes in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In January 1987, more than 1,000 students signed a letter to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government criticizing a crackdown on their fellow students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who had demonstrated for democracy in late 1986. Of those students, 482 signed their real names. Chinese students said most of those who signed the letters ranged from their late 20s to their mid-40s, the generation raised during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, which lasted from 1965 to 1975. Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said this was significant because it showed the affect that decade had on many Chinese. `` <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> taught them to criticize and question everything and that's what they're doing,'' she said.

<HEAD>Amnesty To Be Extended to Aliens Who Overstayed Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced Monday that it will immediately begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who overstayed their student and tourist visas. Until further notice, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also said it will defer the fee for such applications and issue a temporary work authorization card, in accordance with a court directive. The action is in response to a decision by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> ruled March 30 that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration must broaden its standard for determining whether illegal aliens who had overstayed tourist and student visas can obtain amnesty under the 1986 immigration law. Last week, <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> directed <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to accept the applications without the customary $ 185 individual filing fee. INS regulations originally stipulated that non-immigrant aliens who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> before Jan. 1, 1982, for them to qualify for the amnesty program. In a ruling on a class-action suit, <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said the regulation was too restrictive and declared that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the law to mean that any government record, such as tax or Social Security documents, could be used to document that an illegal alien was known to federal authorities as of Jan. 1, 1982. Immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least 50,000 people. Under the 1986 immigration law, illegal aliens who have been in the country at least since Jan. 1, 1982, may qualify for legalized status. A 12-month application period for the amnesty program is due to expire May 4.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance jet slammed into a row of mini-warehouses Monday moments after its two crew members ejected from the cockpit and parachuted to the ground, officials said. The crash ignited a fire in the warehouses about one mile from <ORGANIZATION> Bergstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base, but there were no injuries on the ground, said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimsley </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Capt. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganiko </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, were taken to a <LOCATION> Bergstrom </LOCATION> hospital for treatment, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruck </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> public information officer. <PERSON> Grimsley </PERSON> was pilot of the RF-4C Phantom II plane. <PERSON> Ganiko </PERSON> was its weapons officer. Air Force officials did not release any information about the crew members' condition Monday. The airplane, a reconnaissance version of the F-4C fighter, was stationed at <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON> and was returning from a `` low-level training mission'' when it crashed at 12:17 p.m, <PERSON> Fruck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, manager of the mini-warehouse complex, said her husband and another person were at the location when the plane crashed but were not hurt. Mrs. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said she saw the crash from her car, several blocks away. `` I saw an airplane coming down, and I knew it was in this area. All I could think was, ` Thank God I'm not there,''' she said, adding, `` I had an angel on my shoulder.'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coy </PERSON>, who lives in a nearby residential area in southeast <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said he saw the plane burst into flames in the air as he walked to a store. `` It kind of like turned, and the back end exploded and we saw those two dudes jump out. The airplane kept on going. It kept on going lower and lower after they jumped out,'' he said. Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the wreckage was scattered. `` As far as I can see, the aircraft is in several small pieces, a lot of small pieces,'' he said. <PERSON> Fruck </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would convene a board of officers to investigate.

 A scholar will appeal his conviction Monday for transporting stolen historic documents that belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including letters from <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, his attorney said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, 59, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> native who sports the accent and manners of a British gentleman, was convicted of interstate transportation of stolen goods. He is scheduled to be sentenced in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court May 23 and faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. He was released on $ 50,000 bail pending sentencing. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>'s public defender, said he will appeal on grounds that the court should have paid transportation costs for two Irish men <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> wanted as defense witnesses. Mount, whose $ 18,400 in savings was seized by the government following the arrest, claimed his status as indigent required prosecutors to pay to bring witnesses to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Mount, a respected art historian and former <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> fellow, claimed he owned the documents for years and showed some of them to the two Irish men in the 1960s in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. `` This was not a trial. It was only a hearing of government allegations,'' <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> said after the verdict. `` A trial is when both sides present their case. It did not happen here. ... The government wanted a conviction and they got a conviction.'' The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for another 2 -LCB- hours Monday before returning the verdicts. Mount was accused of selling letters by artist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, allegedly belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bookshop for about $ 20,000 in July. He was arrested by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in August at the bookshop while trying to sell letters and papers signed by <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Civil War generals that allegedly were taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. The government did not charge Mount with stealing the documents. Mount's only defense witness during the three-week trial was a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> woman who said she met Mount in an <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> hotel in 1961 and saw some documents. She paid her own fare to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Mount also has been indicted by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> grand jury on charges of possession of federal property, but <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> said he would question whether <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> should face those charges following his conviction on the transportation charges. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said he did not know if federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would pursue the possession charges. Mount's court-appointed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> counsel, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, did not return phone calls. Mount, who changed his name from <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON> in the 1950s, said he will return to his room in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> boarding house.

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government withdrew thousands of soldiers from the streets of the capital Monday and businesses reopened for the first time after violent anti-U.S. demonstrations last week. Restrictions imposed on two cities under a temporary state of emergency remained in effect, but the government said the emergency might be lifted later this week if no further trouble was reported. Protesters attacked and burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate Thursday night after a Honduran man suspected of drug trafficking was arrested and flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Five Hondurans were killed in the violence. The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of Honduran citizens. The state of emergency imposed Friday gave authorities the power to ban public demonstrations and restrict freedom of movement in the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 125 miles to the north. The cities are the largest in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Many businesses closed Friday as students filled the street for an anti-American demonstration. They remained shut Saturday as thousands of police and soldiers patrolled the tense capital. Major <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, chief police spokesman, said authorities had detained at least 70 people believed involved in the attack on the embassy facilities. Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the number of people arrested in connection with demonstrations and looting could climb to 300 in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>. Thursday night's violence began during a student-led demonstration against the April 5 arrest of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>. Honduran officials took <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> from his <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> home in a pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> without a passport. <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> officials later put <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on a New York-bound flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, held at a maximum-security federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials for questioning in the 1985 slaying in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>. He is also wanted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Honduran legislators criticized the incident and the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> launched an investigation. The violent demonstration was unusual in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' closest allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 4,000 soldiers and police, many in tanks and trucks, patrolled <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION> on Saturday and Sunday. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Lisandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> said Monday that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> received repeated death threats in anonymous telephone calls over the weekend. Monsignor <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, said in an interview that the demonstrations showed `` barbaric instincts'' and dealt a `` blow against the democratic continuity of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> because they tend to undermine human coexistence.'' <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliva </PERSON>, one of the nation's three vice presidents, said the violence occurred because the government violated the constitution in permitting <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s extradition. `` I admire the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fight to eliminate drug trafficking but I consider that that nation has sufficient resources to accuse any drug trafficker who lives here so that he can be judged in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after legal evidence is presented,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> nautical archaeologists excavating the submerged half of <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> found remains of a child killed as he tried to flee during an earthquake nearly 300 years ago, the university said Monday. The partial skeleton of the child, probably no older than 6, was the first found in such a complete state during seven seasons of digging in the sunken city, said project leader <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. Port Royal, once home to English buccaneers and to a young naval officer named <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, boasted a well-to-do population of about 8,000 at the time of the quake. But on June 7, 1692, tremors over a period of roughly 30 minutes dropped blocks of the city into the bay, killing 2,000 residents. Nearly 300 years later, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M researchers will resume their archival work on items recovered so far, the university said. The project will be featured May 2 in the PBS series, `` Underwater Discoveries.'' Among other finds from the latest round of excavations is what appears to be part of the living quarters of well-to-do merchants. Remains of a window complete with its slender lead frame have been recovered where the front of a two-story house smashed to the street during one of the tremors, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. From what is probably the kitchen have come brass cooking pots, sieves, pewter bowls, a woman's gold ring, candlesticks and porcelain dishes. The almost-intact remains of a cricket were found in an unbroken wine bottle excavated where mud had trapped the insect. Port Royal, across the bay from modern-day <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, once was rivaled only by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as a center of British commerce in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>. Residents and visitors apparently liked tobacco because a fourth of the nearly 5,000 artifacts recovered have been pipes or parts of pipes. The port never regained its former importance because earthquakes, fires and hurricanes blocked attempts to rebuild, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Democratic Contenders Voice Support For Notice Of Plant Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential contenders urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stand firm against administration pressure and retain in its sweeping trade bill a provision requiring employers to give notice of plant closings. `` I offer my strong encouragement to your efforts in resisting any further weakening of these already quite modest provisions,'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` I urge you and other conferees to insist that mandatory advance plant notification be included in the final version,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., in a letter to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Both messages were dated Friday and released Monday by the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been pushing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to drop the plant closings provision. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already had called for retaining the provision, which would require companies with more than 100 employees to give 60 days' notice before a plant closing or large-scale layoff. `` I am aware that the administration has refused to accept any form of advance notice provision and has threatened a veto of the trade bill if the conference committee's provision passed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a March 30 letter to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I hope that the threat is only that _ a threat that would not be carried out if the situation actually presents itself.'' `` Regardless of the president's intentions, I urge you to work for retention of the plant closing provision in the trade bill,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The plant closings provision is one facet of a sweeping bill that contains measures ranging from approval for the administration to sign trade deals with other countries to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies. At the heart of the bill are provisions that restructure the way in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliates against violations of international trade rules. Lawmakers say they are designed to open foreign markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. The measure has been approved in large part by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, although a few finishing touches remain to be attended to. Any congressional move to drop provisions that might yield a veto most likely would have to start with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> under powers that have been granted him by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as vice chairman of the conference committee, took the lead in dropping a number of stringent provisions opposed earlier by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The administration has been describing the plant-closings provision as one that would be disastrously expensive for industry. While the measure contains no money provisions, some business groups have suggested it would be a first step toward substantial costs later. The candidates jumped into the debate amid new signals from the administation that a veto could await the 1,000-page trade bill if it arrives at the president's desk with the plant-closings provision intact. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show that he would meet with congressional leaders early this week to discuss what lawmakers must do to win presidential approval of the legislation. `` At the very least it will take removal of some provisions that are now in that bill,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Such, for instance, as a provision requiring that any business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> give prior notice of layoffs or a desire to close a facility.'' He stopped short, however, of saying that a veto would automatically result from trade sanctions in the bill against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> electronics company because of a sale by a subsidiary of submarine-silencing equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` That is something that we do n't like,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` There are a number of things in the bill that we do like. There are a number of things in the bill that we need. I do n't think you can take each and every item in there and say this for sure will trigger a veto. I think you can say that about the plant-closing provision.'' `` My own personal view is that the president will veto the bill if that plant closing provision stays in there,'' he added. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he hoped to bring the final version of the trade bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for a vote next week. He said that before that happens there may be a few changes in the measure and that he is not `` set in concrete'' on how the provisions are drawn.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> on Monday published the clinical procedures that federal agencies must follow in testing their employees for drug use. The final technical regulations published in the Federal Register are essentially the same as <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> originally outlined more than a year ago. Yet to gain final approval are guidelines drawn up by some 40 separate agencies _ thousands of pages in all _ on the more controversial matter of how each agency will determine which employees to test. Those plans are under review by <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to make sure each of the agencies has adopted the underlying clinical testing procedures in their own plans. Once <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> completes that technical review _ expected within a week or two _ all of the individual plans passing muster will be forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for review. Aside from the possibility that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could object to some of the agency plans, an <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> official noted that several employee unions have indicated they are likely to challenge the agency plans in court once they are issued. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>, president of the 700,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said the guidelines are an overreaction `` to a situation that barely exists in the federal sector.'' `` The latest guidelines for conducting random drug tests on government employees not only condemns the entire federal work force as serious drug abusers, but assumes they are cheaters as well,'' <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON> said. Even though they do not address the fundamental controversy of whether to test, the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> standards themselves have been held up at congressional insistence since February 1987 to allow time for informal review and public comment. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered drug testing in September 1986 of employees who have sensitive jobs and instructed <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to develop the scientific procedures to be followed. The Office of Personnel Management subsequently issued regulations in November 1986 that could make as many as 1.1 million civilian workers subject to testing, although only a fraction of that number is likely to actually be tested. Designed to ensure that any person being tested is submitting his or her own fresh urine, the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> regulations published Monday call for water in the toilet stalls where the samples are given to contain a blue dye and for the sample's temperature to be taken within four minutes. Both are to guard against the person submitting a sample diluted with toilet water or one that was smuggled into the testing site. A monitor would be nearby, but would not watch the person give the sample. The guidelines also include elaborate instructions on transportation of samples to make sure they are not mixed up and on the laboratory testing procedures.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired three missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> on Monday, ending a three-day lull in the `` war of the cities.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported later it fired two missiles at `` key military targets'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s capital, and shelled the battered port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the naval base at Umm Qasr and three border towns. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the Iraqi missile attacks killed at least 20 civilians. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitord in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON>, the defense minister, as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is now making most of its own missiles and was capable of `` turning <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> into an inferno ... if the criminal attacks on Iranian cities continue.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> rported <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is producing two types of missiles with ranges of 80 miles or more. The report did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also has said it is making its own medium-range missiles. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used Soviet-made missiles and some Western analysts believe the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles are modifications of Soviet weapons. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the missiles were fired at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> in retaliation for Iranian shelling Sunday of residential districts in <LOCATION> Khanaqin </LOCATION> and two <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> border cities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. In ground action, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian-backed Iraqi rebels killed 680 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the last few days. It claimed 180 Iraqi troopers were killed near <LOCATION> Zardeh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> province in `` infiltration operations'' and 500 were slain in an ambush of a relief column. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards launched an offensive in the strategic region last monthi and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the operations were to avenge the deaths of 5,000 Kurds who it said were killed by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical warfare attacks March 16-17. The Iranians claim they have captured 540 square miles of territory in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since March 16. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its warplanes and helicopter gunships flew 320 combat missions against Iranian forces and other targets Monday. That's the highest number of missions reported flown in one day for months and indicated heavy action along the 730-mile front. On Friday, the Iraqis fired several missiles at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other cities before dawn as Iranians prepared to vote for a new 270-seat Majlis, as the parliament is called. Dispatches from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said the Iraqis stopped shooting after that to `` facilitate the vote-casting process, hoping that new, responsible elements would be elected to parliament who might seriously view the question of the war and put an end to it.'' Reports from the Iranian agency said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sought to disrupt the vote and a `` massive turnout at the polls ... was a bitter defeat for the tottering regime in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>.'' It confirmed one missile hit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Monday and another exploded in <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, which was the capital of <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> in the 17th century. A mosque, hospital and homes were damaged in the two cities, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Five civilians were killed and seven wounded Monday by an Iraqi air raid near the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Orumiyeh </LOCATION> and several people were killed by chemical bombs dropped late Sunday on <LOCATION> Marivan </LOCATION>, 140 miles south, the agency said. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes tried to bomb <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, on Monday but were driven off by anti-aircraft fire, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The latest round of the war of the cities, in which thousands of civilians have been killed, began Feb. 29 and more than 300 missiles have been fired by both sides. <PERSON> Baqer </PERSON> <PERSON> Karimian </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s election commission, was quoted as saying the number of people voting in the <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION> election was 40 percent higher than in 1984 `` despite <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air and missile attacks.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, more than 14 million votes had been counted Moday but final results were not expected for several days. It said officials had declared winners in 160 of the 270 districts, but did not indicate who had won. Western political analysts do not expect any change in the Majlis to hasten an end to the war. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the 87-year-old revolutionary patriarch, has vowed to continue fighting until President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ousted.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign organization said Monday it already has submitted 1986 financial records the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is going to court to obtain. `` If there is a hearing, we will attend to show that we have complied with the order,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gattullo </PERSON>, a representative for Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. She said the material was turned over last week. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, treasurer of the organization, said it has been ordered to court before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> to show why the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> should not be given records needed to verify the accuracy of the group's 1986 tax filing. The hearing was originally set for Tuesday but was continued until April 28. Court documents show that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> first requested the financial information in December 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> also asked for copies of fund-raising letters sent out and `` records of any transactions with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist, founded the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> and was its president until last October when he announced his candidacy. He turned over the operation of the cable network to his son <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The Freedom Council was established in 1981 with seed money from <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION>. According to former council officials, nearly $ 3 million was pumped into the organization from <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, the year <PERSON> Robertsn </PERSON> began establishing his grass-roots campaign organization. Many credit the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, also a tax-exempt, charitable organization, with mobilizing <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s cadre of volunteers, mostly political first-timers drawn mainly from charismatic or fundamentalist churches. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> used these volunteers to pack local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> meetings and caucuses to gain control of the party at the local level in several states. Under federal tax laws, tax-exempt entities can not raise money for, or support, political candidates. The stated purpose of the council, which closed its operation in October 1986, was to educate Christians on how to get involved in politics. However, critics have charged that the group was a front for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s then-unofficial political campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> currently is probing the tax-exempt status of <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> over the same general issue. If the money was used for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign, then the tax-exempt status of <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> would be in jeopardy. If, as <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials have said, the money was used to educate Christians as to how to become involved in the political process, then it would be legitimate donation. Americans For <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the campaign organization, filed for organization with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986. During 1986, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slosser </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> CBN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after retired Gen. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> resigned from the post in the spring. When Americans for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the campaign organization, was organized in July 1986, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> was named acting director. At the same time, he was also a paid consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> became <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign manager until last month when he was assigned other duties as part of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s scaling back of his campaign. Though he remains the lone official challenger of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> admits he has no chance for the nomination. He has laid off most of his national staff and restricted his campaigning to occasional appearances in states that select delegates to the national convention by caucus.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expelled eight Palestinians from the occupied lands Monday, accusing them of inciting the four months of violence there, and it issued deportation orders against 12 others. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed two Arabs after a group of Palestinians threw stones and bottles at a patrol, the army said. Hospital officials said eight Arabs were wounded. Among the 12 receiving deportation orders were six Palestinians from a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village where an Israeli settler girl and two Arabs were killed in a clash last week. Palestinian leaders contended the purpose of the expulsions was to appease right-wing politicians and Jewish settlers angered by an army report that said <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, 15, was killed by a bullet from another settler's gun. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television quoted a top military official as saying the deportations were intended as a warning to Palestinians. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of Rai near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops shot and killed two Arabs after a patrol was pelted with rocks and bottles, the army said. Arab doctors said three other Palestinians, including an 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, were wounded in <LOCATION> Rai </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said four others were wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, another village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The deaths brought to 143 the number of Arabs killed since riots began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Two Israelis, Ms. <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> and a soldier, have also died. The army said Monday that 4,800 Palestinians have been arrested since the riots began. Five hundred of them have been convicted, 3,400 are awaiting trial and 900 are being held in administrative detention, which allows imprisonment without trial for six months. Arab residents of the occupied territories followed <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> orders to close stores and stay home from jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday. Underground leaflets called for a `` day of firebombs'' April 21. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` We strongly oppose deportations from the occupied territories,'' which he described as `` counterproductive. ... They only further inflame passions.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the practice violates international human rights agreements to which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a signatory. The Geneva Convention bars expulsion of civilians in time of war, but Israeli officials say the convention applies only to mass expulsions. Army helicopters flew the eight deportees to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The army offered them a medical examination and gave each $ 50 before soldiers led them to two taxis heading for Syrian-controlled territory. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television showed some of the men carrying their belongings in plastic bags. When the taxis sped off, one of the Palestinians flashed a victory sign. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` We are not expelling residents. We are only expelling agitators, preachers -LRB- of violence -RRB- and extremists. The past has proven that expulsions are one of the most effective deterrents.'' Palestinian leaders said the expulsions would feed bitterness. `` The more the government uses drastic measures, the more people become determined, even though they do n't have the power to overthrow the authorities,'' said <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor deposed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Monday's deportation was the second in four months of riots. The expulsion of four Palestinians on Jan. 13 provoked an international outcry. More than 1,000 Arabs have been expelled from the territories since 1967. Expulsion orders against five of those expelled Monday were issued three months ago. The most prominent deportee is <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Uda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafia </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, described by the army as chief ideologue of a Moslem fundamentalist group pledged to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and create a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland through war. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, a Christian Palestinian who is mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, called the deportations `` a revenge for <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>,'' the village where <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> attacked 16 teen-age hikers and two armed guards from <ORGANIZATION> Elo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moreh </ORGANIZATION>, a Jewish settlement. `` It was done to appease the settlers,'' <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlements council, said Monday's action was `` too little too late'' and demanded more expulsions. The <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> clash Wednesday has provoked debate along party lines since army investigators said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> apparently was struck by a bullet from the gun of <PERSON> Romem </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>, one of the two guards accompanying the teen-agers. Settlers and right-wing legislators said the army report was one-sided. <PERSON> Geulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of the right-wing party <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, the army chief of staff, `` jumped to conclusions and, acting as a judge, pointed an accusing finger at the settlers.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who leads the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said to the critics: `` This is very serious, the attempt to involve the army in political matters.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is negotiating to sell its West German subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> as part of a restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed news reports and industry rumors that its Hamburg-based unit is up for sale. But the officials refused to name prospective buyers or give details of the negotiations. `` We ca n't disclose any details, especially the names of the companies interested in the takeover, while negotiations with interested parties are going on,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials Friday told <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s supervisory board the parent company planned to sell its 99.1 percent share of the German subsidiary as part of a restructuring to lead it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

Company officials declined to say whether the company is profitable but said the company will release its 1987 figure next month. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said in its 1987 annual report it hopes to raise at least $ 3 billion through the sale of assets.

<HEAD>Officials Hail Limited Test Ban Treaty to Mark 25th Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials marked the 25th anniversary of the Limited Test Ban Treaty Monday by hailing it as a historic pact that laid the groundwork for subsequent nuclear arms agreements. Officials gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and Museum to reminisce about the events surrounding its signing. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> praised President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who oversaw the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side of negotiations, saying the treaty `` would not have been attained without a fresh and sober look'' at superpower rivalry by `` that dynamic leader.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, brother of the late president, called the treaty a `` watershed event in Soviet-American relations ... the first major arms control agreement involving the superpowers.'' The treaty, signed July 25, 1963, after 10 days of negotiations in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> involving Soviet, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> representatives, banned testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water. Other testing bans have been signed since, but the Test Ban Treaty remains the only one ratified by both superpowers. Former Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participants in the negotiations agreed at a news conference that the treaty gave rise to a series of other nuclear arms pacts between the superpowers, including last year's accord to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, special assistant for national security affairs from 1961 to 1966, told reporters the signing `` brought a prospect of further and larger agreements,'' and praised <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for ignoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> perceptions that the Soviets were further advanced in testing. <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Roshchkin </PERSON>, a disarmament expert in the Soviet foreign ministry at the time of the signing, concurred. `` This was a first step in post-war history ... a first step in the field of disarmamanent,'' he said. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, special counsel to the president from 1961 to 1963 and part of a small group of advisers that guided the talks from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by telephone, said `` there was a great sense of joy and relief when word was received'' at the White House that the treaty had been signed. `` But backslapping was not the Kennedy way,'' <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> said. `` On the contrary, he immediately began to worry about <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification,'' which came in the fall. Intense lobbying by the president left only 11 Democrats and eight Republicans opposed. Soviet officials recalled the jubilation of their leader, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, as described by former <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in his book, `` A Thousand Days.'' As <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Averell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> strode through a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> park, `` a huge crowd collected behind them,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> wrote. According to the book, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> turned and asked the crowd: `` ` We've just signed a test-ban treaty. I'm going to take him to dinner. Do you think he's earned his dinner?' The people applauded and applauded.'' The signing and subsequent ratification followed 336 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over 13 years. The agreement also was important as a tangible sign of emerging detente after the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the only other nations that openly engaged in nuclear weapons test programs, have not agreed to the test ban. But all <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nuclear explosions have been underground since 1974, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exploded its last atmospheric device in 1980. Disagreement on verification measures has held up joint ratification of the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty limiting test explosions to 150 kilotons. A kiloton equals the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators began a second round of talks on ratifying those two treaties in February, and participants Monday invoked the Limited Test Ban treaty as an example that agreement is possible.

 A senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> envoy said Monday there is no point in continuing talks on ending the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepts a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. `` We do not want to enter into another round of futile discussions and arguments and wrangling,'' <PERSON> Wisam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzahawi </PERSON>, a senior deputy foreign minister, told reporters after a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>.

The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the council to impose an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for not accepting the resolution but has failed to muster the support of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alzahawi </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ready `` to sit and negotiate with the Iranians under the auspices of the secretary-general once the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> obtains <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s unequivocal, clear-cut official acceptance of the resolution. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says it accepts a cease-fire and troop withdrawal as the first steps in a settlement of the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as the aggressor in the war before it pulls out any troops. <PERSON> Alzawahi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is `` not entering into any details of implementation at this stage before we have a clear-cut acceptance from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, held talks with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> dismissed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s position on the resolution as irrelevant and instead urged the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, repeated this request at a news conference Monday, saying the council should ban the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of chemicals used to make the deadly weapons. <PERSON> Alzahawi </PERSON> dodged questions from reporters about <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical warfare and accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of using the weapons.

 Arab hijackers killed a second hostage on Monday, tossed his bloody body from a commandeered Kuwaiti jet and threatened to kill nearly 50 other captives if the plane was n't refueled The gunmen said the dead man was a `` Kuwaiti officer.'' He was the second Kuwaiti military man slain by the hijackers during the weeklong ordeal aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet. The hijackers have demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> release 17 pro-Iranian terrorists convicted in 1984 for bombings at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies. Sources close to the negotiations said, however, that the hijackers demanded freedom Monday only for the three men among the 17 who have been sentenced to death. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has rejected all of the gunmen's demands. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> said his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give in to terrorism. `` We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose more of them,'' he told a news conference. `` This is not the decision of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s government. It is a decision of the people.'' There are 52 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, including three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s extensive royal family and the hijackers, who are wearing blue hoods and armed with grenades and handguns. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said there are at least eight hijackers, all of them Arabs, carrying forged passports from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He was asked if the jet would be attacked and said, `` The decision to storm is not ours. It lies with the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> government, on whose land the plane stands.'' The man killed Monday was pushed from the blue-and-white plane at 3:07 p.m. -LRB- 8:07 a.m. EDT -RRB- after Cypriot officials ignored two deadlines to refuel the jet. Doctors at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> morgue said he had suffered injuries to the side of his face, apparently from a beating. They said he had been shot twice in the head at close range before his body, hands bound behind his back, was thrown onto the tarmac at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We have executed a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officer,'' a hijacker told the control tower. `` We also reconfirm that the craft must be refueled immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.'' At dusk, the hijackers put one of the passengers, identified as <PERSON> Fadl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzouk </PERSON> el-Oteibi, on the radio. Speaking in Arabic, he told the control tower: `` The hijackers say that if you do n't give us fuel they will kill all the passengers. Please listen to this and greetings to my family.'' The hijackers said they wanted about nine hours' worth of fuel so they could fly to an unspecified `` neutral country.'' On Saturday, the hijackers killed their first victim, a 24-year-old Kuwaiti border guard. They set the first deadline for refueling Monday at 1 p.m. -LRB- 6 a.m. EDT -RRB- and warned that `` we will kill a personality related to the unjust Kuwaiti regime.'' The members of the royal family on the plane are businesman <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> and his sisters <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> and Anware. The first deadline passed without incident after <PERSON> Malaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, and a <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> official negotiated with the hijackers. The hijackers then set a 2:30 p.m. -LRB- 7:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- deadline and told the tower that refueling must start or `` you'll receive the corpse.'' Forty-seven minutes later, the body was thrown out. On Sunday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> threatened to kill <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and French hostages it holds if any attempt is made to storm the plane. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, made the threat in a statement delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> along with photographs of American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and Frenchman <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, both journalists kidnapped in 1985. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, is the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Islamic Jihad also holds <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 55. Kidnappers of another American, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, theatened on Monday to hang him. A communique issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by the pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> said: `` We shall put the American agent Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on the gallows if anyone attempts to attack the plane.'' No photo accompanied the communique. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, served with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and was kidnapped on Feb. 17. <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 422 was hijacked April 5 with 112 people aboard as it flew from from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. It was forced down in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were freed. The plane left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday after refueling. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to let it touch down at their airports and it landed at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> after the pilot radioed that he was running out of fuel. Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> Saturday. The hijackers' reference to a `` neutral country'' Monday was the first time since landing at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> that they have given any inkling of where they want to fly if they get fuel. They did not name a country. But <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s Al-Qabas daily reported that Algerian officials have become involved in the negotiations. On Sunday, the hijackers threatened to take off and force the pilot to crash the jet into the emir's palace in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration expressed support for the Cypriot refusal to refuel the plane.

 Security forces detained five <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> journalists Monday in a continuing crackdown on the news media in this West African nation. Office workers at the Footprints Today newspaper said editor <PERSON> Momolu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirleaf </PERSON> and three other members of the editorial board were taken into custody by armed soldiers. A fifth journalist, free-lance reporter <PERSON> Issac </PERSON> <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON>, was seized while he was in the office of the defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, according to other reporters. <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> did free-lance work for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The journalists were detained shortly after the independent <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> declared that the government closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper last week was illegal and vowed to challenge the action in court. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings-Johnson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the four Footprints Today journalists were taken into custody for questioning and <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> wanted to talk to them. Minutes after <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> entered <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>'s office, security agents dragged him out and took him to the office of the provost marshal general who is the senior operational officer for military security, other journalists said. Officials at the provost marshal's office refused to answer questions about <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON>. Less than an hour before he was seized, <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> filed a report to <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, about the press union's decision to challenge the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the arrest last week of one of its reporters, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimley </PERSON>. The government acted against the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> because of articles on the arrest of a Ghanaian for possession of explosives and the firing of the commander of a government anti-terrorist squad. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s independent newspapers announced they planned to shut down for a week to protest government actions against the news media. Those actions included the eliminination of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> news broadcasts on the official radio station. Information Minister <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowier </PERSON> also ordered government-run corporations to stop advertising in the independent news media and water and electricity has been cut at various newspaper offices.

 The attorney for an American convicted of drug trafficking filed an appeal Monday of his six-year sentence. A three-judge provincial court found <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, guilty of drug trafficking on April 5 and sentenced him to six years in prison. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Campa </PERSON>, said she had filed an appeal. She said the prosecution had meanwhile appealed the court's decision to aquit her client on a separate charge of possession of contraband. That charge would carry an additional three years in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Campa </PERSON> said it was normal in Spanish drug cases for the prosecution to appeal if the court failed to convict on the contraband charge. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> is a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate, a 1984 summer intern in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office and a second lieutenant in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reserve.

But a transfer can not be approved until all appeals have been exhausted. he court said it was convinced <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew there was cocaine in the suitcase.

<TEXT>
 Indian and Sri Lankan troops killed 12 Tamil rebels in two gun battles and in a separate incident four Tamils committed suicide by swallowing cyanide to avoid capture, officials reported Monday. Eight rebels were killed Sunday when Sri Lankan soldiers raided a jungle hideout in the <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> district about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. A Sri Lankan military official said the hideout was used by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> who were blamed for the massacre last week of 14 Sinhalese villagers. He said the camp was 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Merigaswela </LOCATION> where the villagers' mutilated bodies were found Friday The troops captured three Soviet-designed automatic rifles, a submachine gun and a shotgun, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He did not report any army casualties. Tamil rebels have been fighting for four years for a separate nation. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s population of 16 million people and they claim they are discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who are the majority. An Indian diplomat in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said that on Saturday, four <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> killed themselves by biting cyanide capsules as they were about to be captured by Indian troops in <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Many Tamil guerrillas carry cyanide capusules, and according to official and unofficial reports at least 200 have committed suicide since Tamil militants began their separatist war. The Indian diplomat, who spoke with the condition he not be identified, also said Indian troops killed four Tamil rebels in a gunfight Saturday at <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, 135 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. He said one Indian soldier was wounded. More than 50,000 Indian soldiers are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm the Tamil rebels under an agreement signed July 29 by the Indian and Sri Lankan governments. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> and has tried to arrange a peace settlement in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the largest rebel group, have rejected demands that they lay down their arms and are battling both Sri Lankan and Indian forces.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders, by refusing to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, are `` responsible for the turmoil and the violence'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Addressing Jewish leaders, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as well as the `` generation of young Palestinians'' in the region, do not bear the responsbility for recent violence there. `` Just as Camp David stands as an example of what can be accomplished when leaders choose peace, the recent events in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> show what happens when <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders are unwilling to walk in the footsteps of President <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>,'' the late Egyptian leader, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the comments in an address to the Conference of Presidents of major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish Organizations, an umbrella group of leaders of 44 of the largest national Jewish organizations. With the race for the Democratic presidential nomination focusing on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary April 19, rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> spoke to the group earlier and strongly sided with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the violence in the occupied territories. The third Democratic candidate, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, has declined an invitation to address the group citing scheduling problems, organization spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, spent much of the day at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He later visited a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant, and planned to attend a private reception and stop at a rally on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. He also was attending an Academy Awards reception. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON>, made a pitch for him as she accepted her Academy Award for best supporting actress on Monday night in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' she said, waving her Oscar statuette. Ms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won for her role in the comedy `` Moonstruck.'' Earlier, addressing the Jewish leaders, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` it is critically important that the world understand who is responsible for the turmoil and the violence'' of recent weeks between Palestinians and Israelis. `` It is not the generation of young Palestinians who have grown up in uncertainty, and who have been taught by their elders to hate,' he said. `` It is not a government in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that struggles to maintain order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with responsible <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders about the future of the territories,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It is, regretably, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders themselves who have time and again rejected the chance to sit down with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and negotiate a permanent peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited `` principles'' for policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ that real progress toward peace will not be made until <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders `` are willing to negotiate directly,'' and until they accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist `` within borders that are secure and defensible.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited his own remarks of 11 years ago, saying, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> needs room to breathe, and a return to the 1967 borders is out of the question.'' He later told reporters `` there will have to be some exchange of land for peace'' but short of a return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prior borders. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> can not be a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> negotiator `` until it renounces terrorism in word and deed,'' until it accepts <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, and until it renounces its own statement that peace `` can only come at the price of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I welcome'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace initiative while not agreeing `` with evey aspect. Taking questions from the Jewish leaders, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he supports establishment of a Palestinian state. He said that should be a matter of negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and neighboring countries. He was also asked about the future of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and said it too `` has too be subject to negotiation.'' He later told reporters, `` I'm for a united <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'' under Israeli control. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked why he has n't drawn more distinctions with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with one questioner describing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` an anti-Semite.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We have differences in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He later told reporters, `` I'm not going to characterize any of the people in this race.'' He said the next president `` should insist'' that the Soviets `` let Jews and other minorities leave if they wish and let them worship freely.''

 A federal agent testified Monday in the cocaine-smuggling trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> that the investigation began in 1977 when he started following large expenditures of cash by a member of a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> gang. Soon into the investigation, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was identified as the head of the smuggling organizaton, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Driver </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, now a convicted drug smuggler, was the key prosecution witness against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and testified he was the pilot for most of the cocaine flights listed in the indictment against <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are on trial on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay from 1978 to 1980 Testimony began Nov. 16. In November 1978, Driver, <PERSON> Starratt </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> pilot flew to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay to investigate <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s assets on the island. `` We were more or less posing as smugglers ourselves,'' <PERSON> Driver </PERSON> said, adding that he and the other agent took photographs at <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s house and dock, but noticed they were being watched When their plane began to take off, they saw a van on the runway carrying a man with an automatic weapon, Driver testified. Under cross-examination, Driver could not recall what weapons <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> police carried when he visited the island last year. `` There is a difference in seeing a weapon in the hands of a police officer and seeing a weapon in the hands of a thug,'' <PERSON> Driver </PERSON> told defense attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> objected to much of Driver's testimony, claiming it was hearsay. Driver has been allowed to sit through the testimony of all witnesses in the trial. When members of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s smuggling group were indicted in 1981, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was listed as one of the co-defendants. Driver testified that federal officials spent four days in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> meeting with the attorney general of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 1983 to seek <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s extration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the trip were <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Starratt </PERSON>. As a result of that visit, an extradition order was signed in May 1984. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was not arrested until Feb. 4, 1987. Driver also testified about the arrest in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s smuggling group, and said that on their flight back to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> about a DC-3 the group began singing `` Homeward Bound'' and commercial jingles The jury also was shown a videotape taken last April on a visit to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay by <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and Driver that showed the island had become nearly deserted. Introduced into evidence Monday were address and telephone books confiscated in a raid on <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s house in February 1987. The books contained phone numbers for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, plus the names of others identified in the trial. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. A separate <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which officials say is responsible for about 80 percent of the cocaine shipments into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with only being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

 <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s reigning royalty turned out Monday evening in basic black and white with a few dashes of color as elegance replaced glitz for the 60th annual Academy Awards _ except for <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. The star of `` Moonstruck,'' who arrived fashionably late, knocked the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her limousine outside the Shrine Auditorium in an almost-not-there diaphanous gown, only partly covered by a dark black cape. But <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was one of the exceptions to the rule. Actress <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> typified this year's style with a bright red cape draped over a long crepe black dress, while <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> exemplified the few bright exceptions, wearing a strapless, knee-length purple dress with a large bow hanging from her side. Perennial <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wore a bikini top over a pale blue mini skirt and sported a puppy on one shoulder, but the rest of the turnout at the cavernous Shrine Auditorium exercised good taste and classic styling. Fifteen minutes before showtime, actresses Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, nine months pregnant and aided by a cane, were seen marching quickly up <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> to the theater in an effort to make it to the Academy Awards on time. Protesters on <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> included Bible-thumping Christians carrying signs reading `` Movie Idolaters Repent,'' `` Fear God'' and `` Repent or Perish.'' Guardian Angel leader <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> and his self-declared band of red-bereted crimebusters chanted alongside the Christians and marched around mock caskets in protest of Friday's release of the realistic police gang movie `` Colors.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police are in the midst of a declared war against gangs, and <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said the motion picture will incite more violence. `` It should n't be released now at the height of the storm,'' he said. Many Oscar guests in limousines and passenger cars gave <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> and his troops thumbs up signs of approval as they passed. Fans in the bleachers were whipped up by <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> greeter and columnist <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archerd </ORGANIZATION> who conducted an impromptu fan poll. The best picture winner on the applause meter was `` Moonstruck.'' In the middle of the bleachers were seven <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> Close lookalikes, with frizzy blonde hair and wearing `` Fatal Attraction'' T-shirts.

<HEAD>Democrats Wrestle With Middle East Policy in New York Campaigning</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 3rd graf pvs with Dukakis' cousin
winning Academy Award</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders are `` responsible for the turmoil and the violence'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories as Democratic presidential candidates wrestled with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy, looking for the right moves for victory in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, often attacked for what critics call pro-Arab stands, continued to distance himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> by saying that allowing extremists at the bargaining table would be a `` formula for catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who earlier exchanged sharp words with fellow Democrats on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, took a conciliatory line. He also admitted he has to do well in the April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary to continue in the race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, got a boost from his cousin, <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award Monday night as best supporting actress for her role in the comedy `` Moonstruck.'' `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' she called as she accepted the award at the nationally televised ceremony in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was making an appearance at an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> that figured in the film, and planned to call his cousin from there with congratulations. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had said beforehand that he thought Ms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` just marvelous'' in the role. And her victory, he said, `` may be a sign of good things to come in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a week.'' Republican nominee-apparent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got back on the trail Monday, visiting an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> research facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and proclaiming his strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a reason for Jews to back his candidacy. `` I think everyone shold vote for me. Besides that, I'm a good friend of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president brushed off concerns that the all-but-concluded <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest could drop him out of the voters' eyes as the Democrats continue to fight `` We do n't have all the excitement that exists on the Democratic side of the aisle, but we have a lot more unity and fewer problems,'' he said. For <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only remaining challenger, there were new problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> asked for a court hearing Tuesday on whether <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign had complied with <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> demands for documents in a complicated investigation of the former television evangelist's organizations. The campaign said it has complied. Yet another declaration from non-candidate <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also roiled the waters. This time, politicians tried to judge the impact of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's roundabout confirmation over the weekend that he would reject a draft at the Democratic convention in July. With Jews expected to make up nearly a quarter of the Democratic primary voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy have held the spotlight in the primary campaign with 255 delegates at stake. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went before the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to give his first extended discussion of the violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` It is critically important that the world understand who is responsible for the turmoil and the violence,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in his prepared remarks. `` It is, regrettably, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders themselves who have time and again rejected the chance to sit down with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and negotiate peace.'' `` It is not the generation of young Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It is not a government in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that struggles to maintain order while seeking an opportunity to negotiate with responsible <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders about the future of the territories.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> distanced himself further from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, with whom he met in the late 1970s. He had said Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the Palestinian people are not the same and that he would not meet again with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements. That's a formula for catastrophe,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said when asked to expand on his comments on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who had strongly criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, called that `` a very useful statement'' and vowed to continue his style of drawing contrasts between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` By raising the issues openly, instead of just behind the scenes ... it makes it a healthy process and creates opportunities for questions and answers that break new ground,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I know I have grown during this campaign. I know the other candidates have.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> admitted that he must do well in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. `` We're running to win here,'' he said. `` But at a minimum, we have to have a finish which convinces'' observers that `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did it. He has the momentum and he has the strength to go on.'' On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issue, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> repeated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, saying the preace pocess should follow the Camp David agreements that foresaw an area carved out for Palestinians with limited autonomy. `` I'm for a peace process that could result in a change of status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on terms that could be worked out by parties involved in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, adding quickly, `` It's unthinkable to have an armed, military, hostile presence so close to a vulnerable point in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> once again stirred the political pot this weekend by saying that he does not want to be the choice of a deadlocked Democratic convention and, in so many words, rejecting such a possible draft. That was not news to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` I always heard his words clearly. I thought he was n't a candidate because he told me he was n't a candidate,'' the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said. Perhaps the quickest reaction was from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION> _ at odds with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in recent days _ who said he would endorse <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> this week. In the all-important delegate contest, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to hold a small lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The AP delegate count gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 745.05 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 709.55. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> trailed with 395.8, while 514.35 were uncommitted. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who has suspended his campaign after a string of poor showings, had 171.5. At the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July, 2,082 votes are needed to win the nomination.

<HEAD>Hijackers of Kuwaiti Jet May Have Smuggled Weapons Through Service
Ramp</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hijack, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The weapons aboard a hijacked Kuwaiti airliner may have been smuggled aboard in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> through the ramp area used by caterers and cleaning crews, an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. `` On the basis of discussions we've had so far, the probability is weapons were placed on board the aircraft through the coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, head of security for the association. Caterers, engineers, cleaners and loaders all have access to the ramp area where the cabin of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was serviced and cleaned before it left <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Tuesday, he said. Thai authorities have not completed their investigation, he added. There are believed to be at least five Arab hijackers on board the jumbo jet, which was commandeered Tuesday on its way to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and has been sitting on the tarmac in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, since Friday. The hijackers have killed two passengers and threatened to kill the remaining passengers if authorities do not fulfill their demand that the plane be refueled. About 45 hostages are being held. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said he thought the weapons were placed on board through the ramp area because it is highly unlikely five people could take guns and grenades through security gates at <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> airport. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a Montreal-based international association of commercial airlines. `` The initial reaction of the Thais was, ` it could n't have happened here,''' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> added. `` But the most logical place for it to have happened was while it was on the ground in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>; it was on the ground there for a considerable period.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, head of the security section of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the operation was obviously well planned and the weapons could have been smuggled aboard any number of ways. Security `` is like a great spider web over the whole world, and there's no way of plugging up every single little gap,'' said <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. `` The chain of security is only as strong as its weakest link.'' The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on April 5 when it was seized by the hijackers, who demanded the release of pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The jumbo jet was forced to land in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were released. The aircraft then left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and landed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on Friday after being refused permission to land in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The Montreal-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency that sets international standards and regulations for safe air transportation.

<HEAD>Sikh Radicals Rule Out Talks, Except on Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEEPAK SHARMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Sikh extremist groups on Monday ruled out peace talks with the government unless they focus on the radicals' demand for an independent nation. Also Monday, police reported five more people killed in the 6-year-old guerrilla war for a Sikh homeland in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Authorities have blamed Sikh extremists for killing nearly 700 people, mostly Hindus and moderate Sikhs, since the start of the year. The five-member <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION>, a subgroup, said Monday that anyone who negotiated with the government and did not demand Sikh independence would be killed. `` No one will be allowed to negotiate with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> for less than <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said, using the name Sikh extremists have given to their would-be nation. `` The struggle for <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION> is being fought in an organized manner, and whosoever comes between the Sikhs and <PERSON> Khalistan </PERSON> will be taken care of,'' the group announced in a statement at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, the holiest shrine for Sikhs. <PERSON> Jagar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a spokesman for the groups, read their statements. Members of both the Panthic Committee, formed in 1986, and the Council of <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, created in October, generally operate underground. Many of them are wanted on sedition and murder charges by the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Panthic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> claims it is the official voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> separatists, and has rejected the authority of traditional Sikh institutions. The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but constitute a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Indian government officials have repeatedly said they are willing to discuss grievances of the Sikh community but ruled out any discussion of independence. The militants' statements came a day after <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, chief priest at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> that he was willing to explore negotiations with the government. But he said militants `` do not seem interested in talks with the government at present.'' The separatists' statements appeared aimed at undercutting Rode, who has called for a gathering of Sikh faithful on Wednesday in southern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The Council of <PERSON> Khalistan </PERSON>'s statement reiterated an assertion by several militant groups that the radicals were not responsible for the recent surge in attacks on Sikh families. The statement blamed the attacks on `` the black cat commando force,'' a special unit created to guard Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. It said the slayings of Sikh moderates were aimed at discrediting the militant movement.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of teachers demonstrated Monday against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> slid further toward chaos in the seventh week of an economic and political crisis. American business executives tried to figure out how they were affected by new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions that could cost <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> millions of dollars. The sanctions prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses from making payments, including taxes, to the Panamanian government. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is virtually bankrupt because of a run on its banks, the freezing of Panamanian deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and a variety of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sanctions aimed at forcing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign. Protesting teachers, who along with 100,000 other public employees have not been paid fully in more than a month, gathered in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and shouted anti-Noriega slogans for several hours before dispersing without incident. `` Pineapple face, you must go,'' they cried in a mocking reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s jowly, pockmarked face. Commerce and Industries Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> said Monday after a meeting with more than 30 representatives of American companies that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> planned to be flexible with firms affected by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. However, he said if the companies do not pay utility bills because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executive order, their services would be cut. `` It is a delicate situation for which we are looking for a way to help the American companies continue operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he had received numerous calls from representatives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms asking how the tax sanctions would be applied. `` If we take this to the letter of the law, I would n't be able to buy a Panamanian postage stamp,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. `` We're in a complete state of confusion.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday invoked the sweeping economic sanctions law against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was expected to issue guidelines this week covering the sanctions imposed under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the steps as an attempt to deny <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` money that could be used to perpetuate his stay in power.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> repeated his claim that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions are an attempt by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to renege on the treaty that will turn over full control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to his country at the turn of the century. `` They want to rewrite history, cancel the treaties by imposing a government controlled by them and reversing the social achievements made since 1968,'' he told the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Monday. Asked if his departure from the country would end the crisis and alleviate the suffering of Panamanians, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said: `` If the people are suffering, it is because of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not me.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis began when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> depose President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still considers <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the legal head of state. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under federal indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, which he denies. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, a Panamanian opposition leader forced into exile said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will start running out of basic foodstuffs in days and such a shortage could lead to the `` final push'' to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> Sunday night from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after 11 days in prison. He was imprisoned after leading a protest march and said authorities told him he could either remain in jail or go into exile. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> urged Latin American nations to abandon their opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pressures designed to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We have been successful in that in ten months we have taken away all <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s support without shedding blood. What he needs now is a final push, and this could be when the economic situation grows sharply worse in the next few weeks, basically for a lack of food,'' he said.

The radio said the president is considering reducing the sentences of <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Livni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharbaf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers who staged a gun and grenade attack at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> that killed three Palestinians and wounded 33 in August 1983. They were sentenced to life in prison in July 1985 but <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> reduced their punishment last year to 24 years each. Several right-wing political leaders have appealed to <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> to pardon the men. The radio said the president was considering a further reduction of their terms in honor of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary. The three settlers were among 25 arrested in 1984 and charged with planning and conducting six attacks against Arabs in the territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. On April 1, <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> ordered the freedom of two other people convicted of taking part in the group's activities. <PERSON> Gluska </PERSON> called the move part of `` a general trend to reduce sentences in the framework of the 40th year of the state.'' One of those freed was New York-born <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, who was serving a two-year sentence for helping to plant a bomb in the car of then-Nablus Mayor <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaka </PERSON> in 1980. <PERSON> Shaka </PERSON> lost his legs in the attack.

 Three black men were fatally shot and the fourth was stabbed to death in separate attacks near the southeastern coastal city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police said Monday. The killings in the <LOCATION> Hammersdale </LOCATION> area outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> were announced in the Monday morning police report which covers incidents during the previous 24 hours. The report gave no additional details on the killings. At least 16 people were injured by guns, knives and fighting when rioting broke out Sunday at an overcrowded black music festival in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police said. Police said they fired shots in an attempt to control the crowd at Kings Park rugby stadium, which seats 50,000. Approximately 120,000 people attended the festival, which began at midday and lasted about six hours despite the scattered violence. Black unrest has declined sharply in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the past year. The only area reporting regular flare-ups in recent months has been the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, where about 500 people have died in black factional feuding since the beginning of 1987. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Former White House spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says in a new book that on two occasions he attributed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> remarks on crucial international issues that the president did not make. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says that in 1983, in the aftermath of the shooting down of a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane with 61 Americans aboard, he credited the president with statements made by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. He also says that during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985 he attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> remarks that he and an assistant press secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, manufactured. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, who has often boasted that he never lied to the press during his six years as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, makes the statements in his book, `` Speaking Out,'' scheduled for publication next month by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scribner </PERSON>'s Sons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut short a vacation at his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and meet with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and with congressional leaders after a Soviet plane shot down the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on Aug. 31, 1983. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says in his book that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declared during the congressional leaders' meeting that the incident was not a problem between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but `` a Soviet versus the world problem.'' In meeting with reporters, the former spokesman says, he `` did a little improvising on my own.'' `` Since the president had had almost nothing to say during the National Security and congressional leadership meetings, I made presidential quotes out of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' comment about the incident pitting the whole world against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as some of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should take,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> writes. `` My decision to put <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' words in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mouth played well and neither of them complained.'' In his account of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says he `` felt that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was really getting the advantage over us in his give-and-take with reporters, while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was very tentative and stilted'' in his comments. `` Fearing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was losing the media version of Star Wars, I instructed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> to draft some quotes for the president,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says. `` I polished the quotes and told the press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one session, the president said to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, ` There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.''' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> used the quote in its evening television news and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported `` the talks were frank. The president's best statement came off camera, aides quoting him as saying, ` The world breathes easier because we are talking together.''' `` Another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quote which we manufactured that received extensive play in the press was, ` Our differences are serious but so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> writes. `` In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,'' the former spokesman says in his account of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting. `` Certainly, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not have disavowed the words, but the Soviets could have said they never heard anything like that. Luckily, the Russians did n't dispute the quotes and I had been able to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my PR man's license.'' In an interview published in Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said that making up presidential quotes `` is not lying ... When you're a press secretary, you develop a bond of understanding with the president so that you think like the president ... I knew those quotes were the way he felt.''

 <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, the quintessential Agent 007 in such <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> films as `` Dr. No'' and `` Never Say Never Again,'' won his first Oscar Monday night for his portrayal of the steely Irish cop in `` The Untouchables.'' <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> received his second standing ovation of the evening as he accepted the best supporting actor award, saying `` patience is truly a virtue.'' His first standing ovation came at the top of the 60th annual Academy Awards ceremony when he introduced the visual effects award amid a spectacular backdrop of cinematic magic. In a 30-year film career, which includes about 40 pictures, <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> also represented his first Academy Award nomination. Winning created a certain dilemma, <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> said on stage, because he had promised to give the award to his wife. `` This evening I discovered backstage that they're worth $ 15,000 and now I'm not so sure,'' he said, then added, `` I'm only kidding.'' The statuettes actually are worth about $ 200 each. He ended his acceptance speech by saying: `` If such a thing as a wish accompanied this award, mine would be that we ended the writer's strike.'' The strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> against movie and television producers is now in its fifth week. <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> was handpicked by <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> to play <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> in `` Dr. No,'' and starred in six more of the spy films including 1983's `` Never Say Never Again.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as one of the `` most extreme elements'' in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, called Monday on Jewish and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> to start <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Talks can, in fact, begin right here in this country,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. His proposal came as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary campaign entered its final week. Nearly one quarter of the Democratic electorate on April 19 will be Jewish and for many of those voters, the future of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a critical issue. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appeared to be reaching out to Jewish voters on Sunday when he declared that as president he would not meet with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, whom he has been criticized for meeting several years ago. At a breakfast meeting on Monday, he also ridiculed suggestions that he would come under greater scrutiny as a result of the electoral successes that have placed him only a handful of delegates behind Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the Democratic race. Running third in the three-candidate race was Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the former civil rights activist, said there had been suggestions that the news media and the other candidates would get tough with him. `` Well, get tough,'' he said. `` Who else has a budget for fighting the drug crisis? `` Who else has a budget deficit plan? `` Who else has significant foreign policy experience?'' And then he said, `` I look forward to tougher days.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and he said, `` It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements _ that's a formula for catastrophe.'' Instead, he said, `` In this city some of your top Palestinian leaders in the world live. Some of your top <PERSON> Jewish-American </PERSON> and pro-Israeli leaders live. We should begin to talk here, to implore both sides to a higher level of security.'' He brushed aside questions about whether he would meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, a group <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to on Monday. He said he also was addressing concerns of Haitians living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, of people from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, as well as of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> and Irish Americans. Later, an aide said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had no room on his schedule to meet with the Jewish group. Monday evening, labor leaders and the rank and file turned out in force at a labor rally in support of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s candidacy. The candidate was interrupted repeatedly with shouts of `` Win, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, Win!'' _ an updated version of the `` Run, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, Run!'' slogan chanted during his unsuccessful first run for president in 1984. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told about 5,000 supporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Jacob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Javits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that blue-collar workers `` will have a friend in the White House'' if he becomes president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reminded the crowd, which represented a wide cross-section of the labor movement, that he has stood with them many times on picket lines, and asked them to stand with him now by supporting his candidacy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also campaigned north of the city, addressing a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and greeting workers at a General Motors plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>. At the college he urged students to `` seize that leadership. ... Young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must lead.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant he sounded his familiar theme of battling economic violence and told the workers, `` We built our campaign at the plant gate.''

 Federal housing officials today announced plans to find out how many black and Hispanic couples are victims of `` racial steering'' or other discriminatory treatment in their search for places to live. The first major study of housing discrimination in a decade would use hundreds of white, black and Hispanic couples as bogus house-hunters to test the nation's metropolitan rental and real estate markets. `` Racial steering'' occurs when agents steer minorities away from all-white residential areas. `` Despite advances in civil rights, discrimination still exists, in more subtle ways than before, in many areas,'' said Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in requesting bids to conduct the study. The deadline for bidding is May 26, with the study expected to be completed in mid-1990.

 Astronomers have found the oldest and most distant galaxy ever seen, an object 10 times the size of the Milky Way that formed when the universe was less than 2 billion years old, researchers said Monday. `` The important thing is that the galaxy appears to be rather old,'' said its discoverer, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Manoa </LOCATION>. `` Even though the universe was only a few billion years old at the time we're looking at this, the galaxy itself was 1 billion or 2 billion years old.

 Ten years of teacher reform have produced `` awesome'' amounts of legislation but left unsettled whether teachers are full-fledged professionals or merely `` semiskilled workers,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday. More than 1,000 bills were introduced and hundreds enacted in legislatures across the country during the past decade boosting teacher pay and tightening rules governing training and certification. But that produced more contradiction than direction, concluded the 80-page report, `` The Evolution of Teacher Policy,'' by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of Rand's Center for the Study of the Teaching Profession in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. They said policymakers have so far failed to resolve the key question: whether teachers are professionals ministering to the individual needs of students, or `` semiskilled workers'' needing constant supervision and regulation.

Many are hospitalized today and can not attend sessions, including 97-year-old <PERSON> Chao </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-hsu </PERSON>, the senior member. Six members died in the first three months of 1988, lowering to 306 the number of mainland-elected lawmakers still in the 884-seat body at the end of March. The aging lawmakers were part of the <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalist mainland government, which was forced to flee to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> a year later by the victory of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-Tung </PERSON>'s Communists in the civil war <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> died in 1975 at the age of 87, and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> died in 1976 at 83. The Nationalist leaders on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> still claim to be the rightful rulers of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and have frozen the lawmakers elected in 1948 into office until the government can return to the mainland to hold new elections. Starting in 1969, however, Taiwanese were allowed seats in the legislature. But with native Taiwanese seeking a greater say in today's government and the mainland-elected lawmakers becoming increasingly feeble, the Nationalists are facing calls to take the gray out of the Legislative Yuan `` Over the past 40 years the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has never paid enough attention to the voice of the people,'' said <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kao-cheng </PERSON>, a lawmaker from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The whole constitutional structure is distorted and destroyed.'' In February, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or Kuomintang, proposed voluntary retirement for the remaining mainland-elected lawmakers and an increase in the number of seats open for election on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which now stands at 73. The proposal also would apply to the 934-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the branch that meets every six years to choose <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s president. The other legislative branch is the Control Yuan, which serves as a watchdog. The opposition party has denounced the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> plan, however, arguing that all seats, including those of the mainlanders, should be open for election. In the meantime, <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> and 11 other opposition party members elected in 1986 are making life miserable for the aging lawmakers. Most of the mainland-elected members belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but some belong to smaller groups, including 74-year-old <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzu-peng </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers constantly refer to the elderly members as `` old thieves.'' They also get into fights with the Nationalists, rip apart furniture and generally cause chaos whenever possible during Legislative Yuan sessions. The 33-year-old <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>'s exploits in this have earned him the nickname `` Rambo'' in the local media. On April 7, <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> stormed the Legislative Yuan podium to stop a vote on the budget. He wound up in a wild melee with several Nationalists that resulted in a decision to provide the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION>'s aging president and vice president with bodyguards. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said that among those who punched and kicked <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> during the scuffle were several elderly Nationalist lawmakers who `` had suppressed their displeasure for too long.'' Opposition lawmakers recently have taken to the streets to protest the `` 10,000-year Parliament'' and in March led a group of more than 1,000 people to a walled suburban compound where many of the aging Nationalists live. At least 16 people were reported injured when demonstrators clashed with the security forces. Opposition party members also have publicized the telephone numbers of mainland-elected representatives and have urged people to call them to demand they retire. Nationalist lawmaker <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hung-hsueh </PERSON>, 72, said he receives one or two calls late each night. Some callers curse while others remain silent, he said. He added that he receives paper money traditionally offered to the dead with his name on it. `` This is shameful -LRB- and -RRB- mean, but it does not bother me,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said in a recent interview. He said he always replies to the callers with a polite: `` Thank you. I am still alive.'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> believes that holding elections in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> for the entire Legislative Yuan would be unconstitutional on grounds that it would become a local lawmaking body. His belief is shared by other mainland-elected representatives. But reform of the parliamentary system was firmly pushed by President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s son who died at the age of 77 in January, as part of his sweeping policy to introduce democratic change to the island. His successor, President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, is a firm supporter of the voluntary retirement package and final details are expected to be announced in coming months.

<TEXT>
 A guest in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> _ and there are guests galore _ does a lot of waiting, but there's always the entertainment of watching other guests. Recently there was the man who identified himself as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessit </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He showed up one day pulling a wooden cross on wheels and said he's been doing that for the past 19 years in all parts of the world. He told a Libyan television crew he and his teen-age son planned to pull the cross from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> through the desert to <LOCATION> Ghadames </LOCATION>, 250 miles to the south, near the borders of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Blessit </PERSON> and his cross rolled out of sight, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Weifenbach </PERSON> came by the hotel lobby where other guests were waiting around. Weifenbach is the burly, mustachioed West German who turned to Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for financing for his ice hockey team back home, and he said he was waiting to catch a plane to <LOCATION> Tobruk </LOCATION>, near the Egyptian border, to hear the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader make a speech. According to <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, the official Libyan news agency, guests pour into <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> all the time _ from all over, even from Indian reservations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Judging by <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, these `` guests,'' most of them members of official delegations, do n't have a spare moment. They're busy bringing flowers to <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, busy touring his barracks-home that was damaged in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air attacks in 1986, busy denouncing `` imperialist aggression,'' busy signing guestbooks. Libyan officials like to present guests with `` programs.'' Programs are sometimes a tight schedule of hospital tours, factory visits, maybe even a suddenly arranged late-night chat with `` the leader,'' as <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is known here. But the programs follow `` Libyan'' time, and `` Libyan'' time means long waits in hotel lobbies and in airport lounges. Some guests, frustrated by the waiting, give up and start for home, only to be yanked back at the plane's door with a promise of an encounter with the `` leader.'' But they eventually find out they've returned only for more waiting at the hotel and looking out over the blue <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. That does n't sound bad; the trouble is, all you can do generally is look, since it's difficult to get out the hotel door. Journalist guests, for example, are often assigned `` assistants.'' These usually are enthusiastic, but sometimes sour-faced young men or women who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. They seem to materialize just when the guest is about to slip out the door for a look around. `` Oh, you know, there might be a press conference with the leader,'' my assistant tells me. `` Maybe an interview. Maybe very soon.'' The guest sinks into a lobby sofa and orders another soft drink or tea; alcohol is forbidden in <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s revolutionary Islamic society. For a change of pace from lounge lounging, there is corridor pacing. Many of the pacers in hotel corridors are proponents of various causes and countries, looking for a sympathetic ear. Visitors sometimes feel like they're in a spy movie, with guests approaching each other stealthily, whispering messages to each other. An Arab man leaned toward a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> woman in the hotel restaurant and said: `` I have something important to tell you.'' `` Yes?'' `` You have nice legs.'' One sunny afternoon, four Western visitors asked their assistants for a car to go to <LOCATION> Sabratha </LOCATION>, site of an ancient Greco-Roman theater, 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Yes, maybe, there was a car, but it was broken. It might be fixed but not for several hours, and the ruins close at sunset. The guests turned to the taxi drivers outside. Sure, said one. `` Fifteen dinars'' -LRB- about $ 50 -RRB-. The Libyan assistants appeared and said something quietly in Arabic to the driver. `` Thirty dinars. Maybe 50,'' said the driver. It was clear the assistants did n't want the guests going off without a program. A few days later, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported on the doings of an Austrian youth delegation. The youths went to a poultry factory and to the ruins of <LOCATION> Sabratha </LOCATION>, it said. They had a program.

<HEAD>Family Awaits for Word of Irishman Missing Two Years in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years after <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, his mother and two sisters say they too have become hostages to unknown kidnappers. `` If they could only let us know whether he's alive or dead _ even if he's dead, it would be better than hoping all the time,'' said his younger sister, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. Despite petitions and appeals to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people and the Iranian and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> governments, no group has claimed responsibility for the disappearance of the 37-year-old teacher, who is a citizen of the Irish republic to the south even though he was born and lived in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> rushed out of his apartment April 11, 1986, late for an 8 a.m. lecture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where he had taught for four months. His mistake, the family believes, was to forget his Irish passport. They believe he was kidnapped by people who may have thought he was American or British, rather than a citizen of a small neutral country. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s only involvement in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is through aid groups and its contingent in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Immediately after <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> disappeared, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> issued photographs of his passport and repeatedly broadcast that he was an Irish citizen, raising the family's hopes that he might be released quickly. But two years later, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> remains the only Irishman among the 22 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. His family is resigned to an indefinite wait for his return. `` We still feel he's alive and we're not going to give up hope,'' said his older sister, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillham </PERSON>. `` We never thought it would last as long as this, but we're going to keep on fighting until we see him released.'' <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who is also accredited as the envoy to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was quoted in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper April 3 as saying: `` People we have talked to do not think Mr. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> is dead.'' He added, the newspaper reported, that hostages could be held for years without their captors making contact, and `` that gives us some hope.'' The only reported sighting of <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> came from a French hostage, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>, 85, who was freed in November 1986. He said one of the five Westerners held with him in an underground prison in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems slipped him a piece of paper on which was written: `` I am <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION>. Please tell my family.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s sisters and his 65-year-old mother, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON>, were encouraged by <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>'s message, but disheartened this past March when <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the Lebanese Amal militia, said that because he had heard nothing about <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, he feared him dead. A photograph of <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> and a scrapbook of news clippings about all the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have a special place in Mrs. <PERSON> Gillham </PERSON>'s tidy living room in a state-subsidized development in east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> `` It's not only the hostage himself that's held, his family's held hostage as well,'' she said `` In our own home, you're afraid to go out in case the phone rings. If you go out for a night out, you feel guilty, the fact that you might be trying to enjoy yourselves and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s sitting in a cell somewhere.'' Belfast-born <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> had lived in the turmoil of sectarian strife that has gripped <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for nearly 20 years. A Protestant, he chose to become a citizen of predominantly <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> rather than of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which governs the province. Everyone born in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has the option of becoming a citizen of either. In addition to teaching, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> was a community worker for the <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has many Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> friends,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gillham </PERSON>. `` He tried to build communication on both sides. He loved his country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said the family did not want his kidnapping to become a political issue. In December, two senior officials from <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, went to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> without the family's knowledge to try to win <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s freedom Mrs. <PERSON> Gillham </PERSON> said it was the similarities between <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that attracted her bearded, easy-going brother to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` When he told me he was going, I said to him, ` Are you sure you know what you're doing? It's like going from the frying pan into the fire.' `` But as <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> said, there's a war there. There's a war here at home and life has to go on.''

<HEAD>West Germany Says Communist Spies Still Flocking In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even though East-West relations have thawed, communist espionage is on the rise in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and probably is aimed more at high-tech industrial secrets than military or political ones, officials say. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been infested with communist spies since its creation in 1949 in the ashes of World War II. The spying has ranged from East German truck drivers rolling through the countryside to moles in the highest of government offices. Among the most important spies caught were <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>, who wrecked Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>'s government in 1974; <PERSON> Margret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeke </PERSON>, who was a secretary to five presidents; and <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotsch </PERSON>, who delivered top-secret <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> documents to the Soviets. But just last month, West German federal police arrested 11 people suspected of working for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet intelligence agency, and are investigating others. `` The large number of arrests confirms that instead of refraining from activating agents in a time of detente, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc is intensifying its espionage activities,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told reporters after the March sweep. <PERSON> Hans-Gert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s counter-espionage agency, said warmer East-West relations increase the opportunities for spying. `` The thaw has increased interest in obtaining information, and also improved conditions for espionage,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said in an interview at his <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> added that because some communist countries have loosened emigration restrictions, a danger increases that agents have been planted among the refugees. `` Emigration plays an important role in espionage in the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, as has been shown by the arrest of the suspected <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. Among the 11 suspects arrested in March were four Soviet emigres. With communist research lagging behind the West in many areas, Soviet bloc agents have intensified their efforts to obtain secrets from private companies in science and high-tech fields, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. `` The interest in political secrets is still great, but for technological and scientific matters it has grown considerably,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said. Security officials estimate that as many as 3,000 spies are at work in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, most of them from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Between 30 and 50 suspected spies are arrested each year, the counter-intelligence office says. Secretaries and other government employees in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, are among those who have been caught Also, security officials have long suspected that East German truckers driving through <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> report on military movements and gather other information for the East German secret service. But a spy can come from anywhere. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> automatically grants citizenship to all ethnic German refugees from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, making the task of isolating communist agents extremely difficult. In addition, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have improved relations over the past few years, resulting in more contacts between the two sides and greater chances for espionage. East German authorities have allowed the resettling of its citizens to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to increase dramatically, reaching a high of 30,000 in 1984, compared to just 7,000 the year before, according to federal statistics. Past spy scandals have damaged the nation's image among other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> arrested 16 communist agents in 1976 after cracking East German infiltration methods. But it turned out that two of the spies, <PERSON> Lothar-Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutze </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Renate </PERSON>, had been passing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> documents to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the 1960s. West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leber </PERSON> resigned over that scandal. In 1974, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>, a close aide to Chancellor <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, was exposed as an East German agent, and <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> began serving a 13-year jail sentence in 1975 _ the longest ever given by a West German court to a convicted spy _ but he was released six years later in an exchange of agents with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Constititution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> itself was rocked by the defection to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiedge </PERSON>, who headed an agency group responsible for catching East German spies. Security officials believe many of the communist agents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> now can do only minor damage. `` But one must be careful when one uses the term ` small fish','' said <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. `` A small fish can always become a bigger one.''

<HEAD>Mystery of the Missing Nuclear Scientist Captivates Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disappearance of a leading nuclear scientist has Taiwanese fuming at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and worrying about damage to their national security. Newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after Col. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien-yi </PERSON> vanished in mid-January that he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and might have turned over nuclear secrets to the Americans. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was a deputy director of the official <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. He disappeared while on leave from his post. `` We immediately looked at this map, maybe he fell off a cliff,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuang-chi </PERSON>, secretary general of the government <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, as he moved to an office wall map of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and traced a route along rugged interior roads. But several local newspapers provided a different scenario for <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance, reporting that he was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant who left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with details about a Taiwanese nuclear weapons program. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month that the department had no comment on whether <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> was an informant for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests here, has told the government and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear bomb. Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said the production of atomic weapons by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would be reason to invade the island, which <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> regards as a renegade province. Nevertheless, the uproar over <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> has increased anti-American sentiment that already was brewing here because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s tough trade talk with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which last year had record $ 16 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and recognized the Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> government, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> remains the island's major trade partner and arms supplier. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> serves as an operative diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy. `` I get a lot of hot reaction from my students,'' said <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> who also teaches at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chengchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Until this point there's always been a huge reservoir of good will toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... but I think the reservoir has cracked.'' The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> media, which has given intense coverage to <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance, also has criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> A March 25 commentary in the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said that no matter what the motive, `` the act of stealing our defense secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a certain degree. ... No one can interpret this as friendly behavior.'' <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials now believe <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They have asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for information about him but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration claims it does not know his whereabouts. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> recently said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> can not lodge a protest with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because `` we do n't have evidence showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government or <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> involvement.'' But Jaw Shau-kong, a maverick lawmaker from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is demanding retaliatory action. The government `` probably should expel some -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- diplomats from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, expel some <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>; it can not keep silent,'' said <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON>, who views the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an imperialist nation. <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON> said he fears <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> took important military secrets, possibly classified information about <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s missile development program. Jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into the hands of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, the nuclear energy official, noted that many of <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the military-run <ORGANIZATION> Chungshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> The government maintains, however, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> did not take any sensitive information from <LOCATION> Chungshan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> believes the missing scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew of work done by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> staff for military-related Chungshan projects. Professor <PERSON> Su </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s disappearance is unlikely to cause a serious re-evaluation of Taiwanese-U.S. relations but could eventually lead to public debate of the country's nuclear policy. In early April, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published a poll that indicated <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was split over the development of nuclear weapons. According to the survey, 35 percent of the 767 people polled by telephone said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> should make atomic bombs while 34 percent were against such a policy. The poll, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, indicated most people believe <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is capable of making the weapons. Nearly three-fourths of the respondents said that if <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Excellence in Education set off alarms with a provocative report that warned of `` a rising tide of mediocrity'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools. The man behind that report, <PERSON> Terrel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, says he never expected such a stir.

<TEXT>
 T.H. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, considered by many to be the father of the school reform movement, views himself as a failure when it came to educating the most important pupil he ever faced: <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Three years after he quit the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> frets that school reform `` did n't do a darn thing'' to solve the problem of dropouts and those who can barely read the words on their high school diplomas. Most are poor; many are minorities. `` We're losing 30 percent to 40 percent of the rising generation,'' says the former Secretary of Education. `` They're out of school and they're unemployed and unemployable.'' It might have been different, he says, if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had taken to heart the message of the bombshell report that <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> commissioned, `` A Nation At Risk.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> made headlines on April 26, 1983, with its blunt warning: `` The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and a people.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded by extolling tuition tax credits and prayer in public schools _ two things that `` A Nation A Risk'' never touched upon. But the president and his advisers soon realized that it made political sense to pay more attention to education. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began visiting schools and speaking out about the need for tougher standards for students and teachers alike. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who had come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to preside over a department <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had promised to abolish, began traveling with the president on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and handing out `` flags of excellence'' to schools at White House ceremonies. Governors and business leaders took the school reform message to heart and began pouring more dollars into local school budgets while seeking to hold educators more accountable. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> `` the second-most important man in this administration.'' And, in perhaps the ultimate compliment, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had sought to cut billions from the education budget, actually proposed a modest budget increase in 1984, an election year. But when that election was over, <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent word that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would try with renewed vigor to boot education out of his Cabinet. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> submitted his resignation and returned to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to teach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. Now he has written a book, `` The Thirteenth Man: A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet Memoir,'' that lays bare his struggles within the administration and the regrets that set in after he left it. `` I tried to convince the president and his people of the bonds that tie together education, the economy and military strength. But notwithstanding the fact that I had been a teacher for much of my adult life, I never succeeded in getting this lesson across to them,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, in his book, made no mention of his successor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has been a forceful advocate of tougher standards for schools and colleges, and has made his own headlines with studies comparing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese schools and proposing a core high school curriculum. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> thinks the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reponse in the second term has been inadequate. `` <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has very effectively used the bully pulpit,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But for some reason the response has n't been such as to rally the whole nation around this _ the fact that we're losing a third of the whole nation to academic deficiency and illiteracy I'm not talking about <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> so much as I am about <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' `` We missed an opportunity to fully take advantage of ` A Nation At Risk' and all the attention on it by not giving it a high priority and a high profile in the second term,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> says. `` Had the president done that, the results of the reform movement would have been much more impressive than they are.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> credits <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with moving the country `` away from the drift toward the welfare state and highlighting the strength of our capitalist, free enterprise system.'' But, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> adds, `` He could have added to that by being the president who turned around and solved the American education system. We ca n't say that now.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> book at a congressional hearing, said `` The Thirteenth Man'' suggests <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was the `` only virtuous man in the administration and the rest were knaves and louts.'' `` Unlike Bell, I wo n't leave the job and then go write a book criticizing the people for whom I worked,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Bennett said.</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> takes no comfort from the education rhetoric he has heard from the presidential candidates, including promises from both <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that they will be `` the education president.'' `` We should be asking the presidential candidates: ` If elected, what do you plan to do to lead the nation into a truly great education system and to transform <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a learning society?''' Even before it was published, `` The Thirteenth Man'' made headlines with <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s claim that he heard `` mid-level right-wing staffers in the White House and at <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'' make racist jokes and ethnic slurs. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> has never named names. The book recounts <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s bitter, often losing struggles within the administration on budget, personnel and policy with people whom he regarded as conservative ideologues. Conservatives regarded <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> as a mole of the education establishment in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet, a big-spending liberal who had testified in 1978 in favor of creating the Education Department. If they needed any evidence to support those views, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> provides it in abundance in `` The Thirteenth Man.'' `` Those who accused me of being part of the educational establishment were right,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who had served two previous stints in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, one as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissioner of education in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, between school posts in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Bell calls for $ 25 billion in new federal, state and local spending on the Chapter 1 remedial program for disadvantaged students, Head Start, the pre-school program for poor children, and the Job Corps. He said the country should attack the problems of illiteracy and dropouts with `` a national movement of the magnitude of the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild the war-ravaged nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the end of World War II.'' But, he says, `` money by itself is not the answer. We can not ignore the other part of education, and that's the home and family.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s own life story is testimony to the power of both education and the family. Bell grew up in poverty in <LOCATION> Lava </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. His father died in an accident in 1929 when <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> was 8. His mother, <PERSON> Alta </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, raised nine kids in the Depression on virtually no money. When he graduated from high school as valedictorian he wore a suit that, without his knowledge, Mrs. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had bought with money donated by his teachers. He headed off to the college with the lowest tuition in the state, <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. It charged $ 11.50 per semester. `` My life at <LOCATION> Albion </LOCATION> opened richnesses beyond anything I ever imagined,'' he recalls. `` I was ignorant of our own history and of the great literature of the Western world. I knew nothing of the Federalist Papers, the works of Tolstoy, or the rudiments of economics. This all came to me courtesy of the taxpayers who founded and supported a state normal school to prepare teachers to teach their children and grandchildren.'' It also came courtesy of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s New Deal and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which supported the part-time <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> job that paid him $ 17 a month _ enough to cover his $ 4 rent and leave $ 13 for food, which his mother supplemented by mailing four loaves of bread every Wednesday. His experiences at <LOCATION> Albion </LOCATION>, now defunct, made it all the harder for <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> to support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cuts in student aid, cuts he now says were `` absolutely wrong.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that when he left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, `` I had a nagging feeling of betrayal.. I felt frustration at not having been able to secure an enduring commitment to the cause of education at the highest federal level. On the positive side, he says, `` we are educating 60 to 70 percent of the youth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better than in previous decades.'' College-entrance test scores have stopped sliding, states have raised high school graduation requirements dramatically and installed competency tests for both students and entry-level teachers, and `` at least 30 states have taken steps to build career ladders for teachers that reward distinguished teaching performance.'' But, he says, then there are the bottom 30 percent to 40 percent of students for whom the push for school reform `` did n't do a darn thing.'' `` In my mind,'' he adds, `` nothing could have assured <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s place in history more than his enduring commitment to the school reform movement that he supported so effectively for 18 months, only to abandon it after the election.'' `` Failure to educate millions of our people adequately will move us toward disaster if we do not alter course,'' he warns.

 When school administrators sit up and pay attention to what teachers have to say, students learn more. That's the theory behind a pilot program in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that has educators across the country taking notes. `` We people on the front lines _ and we really are on the front lines _ have a real contribution to make,'' says <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lentin </PERSON>, a first-grade teacher at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s teacher of the year, a classroom instructor with 30 years of experience School-based management and shared decision-making are the cornerstones of the program implemented by the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> in the fourth-largest school district in the country, with 255,000 students in 260 schools. Other elements of the program include a proposal to improve inner-city schools by involving various community organizations, Saturday classes, a satellite kindergarten in an insurance company, and various professional growth initiatives. But the decision to give schools more say in their own management, with input from teacher committees, is the most fundamental of the reforms, which had the enthusiastic support of the teachers union. Last spring, 53 schools designed programs detailing how they would make decisions normally handed down from a central or regional office, concerning such things as budget, curriculum and schedules. Eighteen elementary schools, 10 middle or junior schools, four high schools and one adult education center were chosen to participate in the four-year program that began this school year. `` The people that are the closest to making the decisions as to what needs to be done to educate the kids _ we're talking about the teachers _ are actively involved in that process,'' says <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Southwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>. The concept of teachers committees participating is revolutionary, according to <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tornillo </PERSON>, executive vice president of the teachers union. It's put <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> at the cutting edge of educational reform, says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, superintendent of schools. `` People across the country are looking on in amazement,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said recently, just before he left for <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with three other Dade educators to discuss what's happening here. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> officials have been invited to cities across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to explain the program, and interest has been expressed from as far away as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenkman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>. Educators from elsewhere also come to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> to see the innovations, she says. `` We have a lot of people that come in and marvel,'' says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Palmetto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> says that since the program was implemented enrollment has jumped from 360 to 480, volunteers have increased and businesses are proposing school projects. Palmetto, which was 25th in attendance among Dade's 178 elementary schools, moved up to first place with 97.4 percent average daily attendance record. Since parents had expressed dissatisfaction with the school's Spanish program, the committees proposed hiring teachers from <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> language school, one of the more widely publicized changes in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> Teachers also decided it would be better to spend money on aides rather than a part-time assistant principal. But the most important change, members of a five-person steering committee unanimously agree, is something they call `` flip-flopping.'' Under the scheduling innovation, classes are divided into thirds, twice a day. One third might go to music class and another third to library. The classroom teacher then gets to teach basic skills to a very small group of children. `` We're able to really work with them and give them the individual help they need,'' says <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a fourth-grade teacher on the steering committee. `` When we're flip-flopping, we do n't have discipline problems,'' says <PERSON> Mercides </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the school's union steward who chairs the steering committee and teaches third grade. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, who chairs the school's scheduling and curriculum committee, praises the flip-flop for another reason: It enables her to teach `` Social Studies Through Art,'' a specialized class she developed under school-based management. The changes initiated by teachers have varied widely from school to school. At Mrs. <PERSON> Lentin </PERSON>'s school, a common dismissal time was adopted for all grades for the safety of younger children who previously had to wait for older brothers or sisters to get out of school. In <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s school, teachers outlined major objectives for the school year, including closing the minority achievement gap, infusing critical thinking throughout the curriculum, increasing teacher expectations, encouraging handicapped students to stay in school and improving standardized test scores. In <ORGANIZATION> Bunche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Opa-locka </LOCATION>, mildly handicapped students now have a housekeeping lab to learn how to take care of themselves and elaborate report cards come out every six weeks instead of every nine weeks. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON> in western <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> came up with a new way of hiring good teachers: Let teachers themselves do the hiring. `` Our current teachers interview prospective teachers,'' says <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Menia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` Oooh, they're tough. They ask questions I would n't dare ask.'' Six new teachers have been hired so far and <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has not gone against her teachers' recommendations once. <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON> is also offering sixth-graders two elective courses on Friday afternoons, when students can take drama, advanced computers, video productions, geography and other courses not normally offered. `` School-based management is the kind of program teachers have dreamed about for years,'' says <PERSON> Merri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a professional issues specialist with the teachers union.

It was murder and mayhem, cops and robbers, rhythm and blues and the big band sounds of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>. It was the Rocket, the Skyliner, the Black Cat, the Showboat, the Barrel, the Casino, the 3939, the Four Deuces, the Cocoanut Grove, the Bad Liquor, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s and the lure of a young baby-faced stripper named Candy Barr. It was <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 199, a neon ribbon of revelry flowing northwest out of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Azle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. In its heyday, a 10-mile stretch of that highway was a symbol of the state's rough-and-tumble heritage and a playground for the brave, bold, adventuresome and foolhardy. The lights flickered and dimmed years ago. And now the party's about over

 As a youngster growing up on <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON> scrambled atop the roof of his dad's gambling joint on Saturday nights and assessed the economy by activities along the road below. `` If it was a three-ambulance evening, money was a little tight,'' he recalls. `` But seven or eight ambulances meant everything was OK. People were out spending money and boozing and brawling. <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON>, 60, called them the `` good old bad days.'' Well, the good old bad days are gone, and so is the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway of yesteryear. And what's left of `` Thunder Road'' is about to give way to a new eight-lane freeway. A victim of urban growth, changing lifestyles and its own wicked reputation, <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> has become in recent years something of a toothless lion and a bit of an eyesore. The new freeway, with a 1990 start date, may cut down the few remaining landmarks and provide the final nail in the coffin of a wild and woolly era.

 The stories are legion, an intriguing blend of fact and fiction, a bit of myth and more than a dash of truth. Anyone who's been there is an expert on <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. Listen ... <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>: `` When they widen that highway, they'll probably find a whole bunch of skeletons.'' <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>: `` Liquor laws? Practically nil. Everyone had a bootlegger.'' <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>: `` They were n't all killers. They just loved to fight.'' <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>: `` There were more cathouses up and down the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway than you could shake a stick at.'' <PERSON> Cleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON>: `` When someone got too big for his britches, he just disappeared ... and they'd find him in a well.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabluck </PERSON>: `` I'd drive my wrecker out to pick up their cars, and I'd take pictures of the murder victims for the sheriff's office. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>: `` The further you went, the badder it got. You could get in to anything you were big enough to handle.'' A customer at <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> 21: `` I really liked the old Tower Motel. The popular phrase was, ` Let's go to the Tower for an hour.''' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnussen </PERSON>: `` There was more perverted sex on the parking lot of the Albatross Club than in any of the motels along the highway.'' <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>: `` You ever hear of <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>? Nobody ever whipped him. I do n't mean he was such a good fighter, he was just tough.'' A customer in the Scoreboard: `` <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> was so tough he wrestled his pet bear. But his mama was tougher.'' Another customer at the Scoreboard: `` One-eyed <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> once put out a cigarette in a guy's ear. The guy came up with a knife ...''

 At roughly 2:30 one morning, a <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway club owner who demands anonymity left the Scoreboard lounge after attending a wedding party for a friend. In the parking lot, two punks stuck a knife to his throat, took his money and his ring, roughed him up and left him lying on the ground. `` We ought to kill you,'' said one. `` You damn sure should,'' the victim gasped. The assailants laughed and left. Later, after paying $ 250 to a stoolie, the club owner tracked down one of the muggers outside a beer joint. Luring him into his darkened car, he `` extracted'' an eyeball and a substantial number of teeth and shot off both of the guy's kneecaps. Then he dumped him in front of a hospital and drove away. Noticeably impressed by the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> justice, the second assailant fled to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and has not been heard from since.

 Once, after a string of burglaries up and down the highway, the same club owner got a cot, a washtub full of beer and a 12-gauge shotgun and lay in wait nightly for the bandit to return. It was not a long wait. The burglar crawled through an opening in the roof and dropped to the floor. The first thing he saw was the club owner, who shot both his legs off.

 At <ORGANIZATION> Inez </ORGANIZATION>' 5050 Club, <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> herself is reminiscing about the good old bad days, fretting over the new highway and complaining lightheartedly that at age 69 she's having difficulty finding a new husband. `` I'm looking,'' she says. `` I do n't want to die alone.'' `` How many husbands you had?'' wondered a customer. `` Nine,'' she replied. `` And that's not counting repeats and licenses I did n't use.'' Besides the sparse spousal straits, <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> is also unhappy about <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>'s tarnished image. She insists it got its reputation dishonestly, blaming all those messy, headline-grabbing shootings, stabbings and bombings. `` I've never had a shootin', a cuttin' or even a real good fist fight. I always thought they had more trouble on Camp Bowie -LRB- <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> -RRB- than we ever had out here,'' she says. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, manager of the 5050, says she's spent all her 41 years along the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> and that her father, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, introduced her to the rowdy side of life at an early age. `` My dad loved to fight,'' she smiled. `` He did n't go out to drink; he went out to fight.'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> got word one night at the Green Room that a stranger was hitting the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway honky-tonks claiming to be the toughest guy in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He found him at a club that <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> said was so rough `` they issued you guns and pool sticks whether you needed them or not.'' He stormed through the door and shouted: `` Where's the so-and-so who says he's the meanest man in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>?'' `` That's me,'' the stranger growled. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> knocked him over the pool table. `` When he wakes up,'' he told the bartender, `` tell him the toughest SOB is back at the Green Room.''

 <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> was not the toughest of the Jacksboro Highway regulars, but he ranked right up there with the meanest. Like his buddies <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> and several other world class thugs, <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> had a high tolerance for violence. At 2:10 a.m. on May 3, 1955, <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> were busy examining the fruits of an extortion caper when two gunmen opened fire on their car parked outside a <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway nightspot. <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> escaped in a fierce gunbattle, but <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was fatally wounded and died the next day. Unfortunately, <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> later had a serious falling out with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, perhaps over the loot from a robbery linked to a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> weapons deal. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON>, blew his head away in fact, and dumped his body in a well. Old Gene <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spent an extraordinary amount of time in trouble himself, none worse than what occurred on April 29, 1957. That day he and a pal named <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> were rehearsing a scheme to rob the <ORGANIZATION> Carswell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> payroll. Incidentally, the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> was off limits to <PERSON> Carswell </PERSON> personnel, in part because someone finally figured out that cowboys, cedar choppers, cold beer and <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> flyboys were a volatile mix. At any rate, an army of law enforcement officers that included the police chief, the sheriff and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> interrupted the robbery rehearsal and chased <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and his crony out the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway nearly to <LOCATION> Springtown </LOCATION>. After wrecking their car, the two desperadoes exchanged gunfire with officers as they fled on foot along <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON> claims he was born in the back room of the 2222 Club while a crap game was in progress up front. `` I grew up in a strange environment,'' he quips. He and others of his era maintain that <PERSON> Pappy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON>'s club enjoyed a reputation not only as a squeaky clean gambling den but also a place where the rich and powerful could eat, drink and wager in private. That group, <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON> said, included <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleberg </PERSON> of the vast King Ranch family, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> and big game hunter Frank Buck. `` They were our house guests all the time,'' he said. `` Pop would close the gambling joint sometimes and he and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> would knock down about two quarts of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s a day. I did n't know much about politics, but I knew this was a powerful man. `` It was a gambling joint and maybe a little illegal, but <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and the others were comfortable there.

 The Four Deuces also provided a shot in the arm for the local economy, he said, considering the amount of whiskey, turkeys and hams <PERSON> Pappy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON> dispensed to his special friends.

 Aside from <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> and his crowd, among the best-known and best-liked figures on the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway were a gambler, a sheriff and a man who probably has owned more clubs than anyone along the strip. That in itself says much about the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. The gambler was of course <PERSON> Pappy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkwood </PERSON>, who died in 1983, and the sheriff was the late <PERSON> Sully </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, who friends say winked at the law when it came to gambling, girls and illegal booze but would not tolerate `` serious'' criminal activities. Those same friends concede that Sully raked off a generous amount of the cash flowing up and down the highway, but they maintain he was a `` first cousin to Robin Hood'' and shared his wealth with the less fortunate. It is not clear, however, who those less fortunate were. But for sheer dash, color and staying power, few could rival <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, whose clubs included the Cocoanut Grove, the <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION>, the Barrel, the Sugar Pool and the Thunderbird. `` I owned the Barrel seven different times,'' says <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, 72, who in the good old bad days was known as mayor of <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> met and mingled with the best and worst of the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> crowd and knows a great deal more about the Strip than he's willing to tell for the record. He took a reporter on a recent tour of the highway, pointing out such landmarks as the Skyliner Ballroom where stripper Candy Barr performed and the spot where <PERSON> Tincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggleston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> were ambushed. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> explained how a gambler survived an intricately conceived house bombing behind the original <PERSON> Chenault </PERSON>'s Drive-In only to be gunned down later on <LOCATION> Watauga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. It was back down the highway at the <ORGANIZATION> Albatross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>'s buddy, <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, celebrated his last birthday A gambler best known to reporters and lawyers for his home-smoked barbecue, <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> was shot to death shortly after leaving the party. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>'s tour that evening took him past the Chateau, once a gambling palace called the 3939 Club, and out to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Casino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, site of the grand old Casino Ballroom. `` In the 1950s, that was the nicest place on the <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>,'' recalls a 50-ish <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Nettles </PERSON>, who grew up on the north side. `` They had all the big bands, and you could dance inside or outside. `` Thirty years ago, at that age, that was the place to be. The Skyliner and the Rocket were raunchier.'' <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> noted that a car lot stands now where first the Ring Side and later the ultra-plush 400 Club provided late-night and after-hours dining and dancing downstairs and gambling upstairs. Retired State Judge <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> says the 400 Club flourished in the 1930s and 1940s with name bands and top floor shows and what may have been the first pre-cut steaks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It was first class,'' said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, who earned a reputation as the best criminal trial lawyer in town by defending more than 100 accused killers, a sizeable number of them from <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>'s tour took him finally to <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> 21, which holds the oldest continuous beer and wine license in <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and is probably the oldest business establishment on <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. Opened in 1934 in an old streetcar, <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s today is the quintessential <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> roadhouse with its neon beer signs, leather bar stools, Tombstone pizza and dancing on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays to a group called The Jacksboro Highway Band. Hanging behind the bar is a 1936 photograph of a dapper <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> standing beside a wrecked <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> coupe. Laughing, <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> recalled the time years ago when a drunk entered one of his clubs and asked where he could get a bite to eat. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> directed him to <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s. A short time later, the phone rang. It was <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>. `` Cliff, do n't you ever send me no more business!'' he wailed. The drunk had driven his pickup truck through a wall into <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s kitchen. <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>, is still a <LOCATION> Jacksboro </LOCATION> Highway fixture and his son-in-law <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitton </PERSON> now runs the club. Bemoaning the pending freeway, told a reporter, `` It looks like they're going to put us out of business.. They're tearing down tradition here.

 From atop <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s World Trade Center, you can just about see Chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s homeland. <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> and a 2,800-member tribe of the <ORGANIZATION> Ramapo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> live about 30 miles away, beyond the broad waterway that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> claimed for the Dutch in 1609, beyond the suburbs and department stores of northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, beyond too the great highways and metropolitan traffic pulsing through the jet-streaked smog. There live <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> and his people, in the bosom of the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, on the edge of the din. Professional shingles are few, and many eke out marginal livings as mechanics, domestic help, school bus drivers and the like. Much industry that once bolstered their community, like the <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahwah </LOCATION> plant where <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> worked for 28 years, has left for more desirable locations. The community is a cultural eddy of mixed-race people not fully accepted as whites, blacks or Indians. `` My grandfather was wearing a three-piece suit while Indians out West were still shooting bows and arrows,'' <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> says. The chief is leading his people's effort to wrest formal recognition as a bona fide Indian tribe from a wary <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by year's end. Community leaders say such recognition could eventually translate into increased public assistance, millions in profits from high-stakes bingo games which are allowed on Indian reservations, and jobs for many of the tribe's idle young people. Some <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people also hope it will put to rest forever the identity crisis of their community, reviled as inbred and dangerous by many outsiders and grasping at fleeting threads of a heritage disputed by anthropologists. `` We've been recognized as a little bit of everything but what we want to be recognized as,'' says <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hillburn </LOCATION>, a village on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> border where hundreds of <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> People live. `` We know that we're a mixed people. But we know too that the strongest part of our background is American Indian.'' The <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people, sometimes shy about talking to outsiders, say they've been victimized by prejudice, the press, and even by progress. `` The characterization they put on us was that we were shifty, you could n't go near us, if you gave us a job, we'd rob you,'' <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> says. `` If somebody would tell the truth, not make out like we were going to doggone skin you alive, it would be a lot easier.'' Also known as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> is a first cousin and neighbor of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunk </PERSON>. Van Dunk mailboxes line the streets of <LOCATION> Hillburn </LOCATION>. You also see many De Freeses, De Groats, and <LOCATION> Manns </LOCATION>. In fact, in order to be accepted as a tribe member, a person must either carry one of only six family names or one of his ancestors must have, the chief says. The <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people, who live mainly in three communities straddling the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> border, have been held in contempt by many outsiders for inbreeding. `` It's one of the few communities you go through where two-thirds of the people have two family names, and the other third is probably related,'' says a state legislative aide from the area who asked to remain anonymous. <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>, a handsome man of 55 with ruddy skin, gray hair, and a <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> mustache that belies his shyness, dismisses questions about inbreeding. He's heard them before. `` What people do n't understand is that not every <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunk </PERSON> is related,'' he says. `` That's been part of the problem. People think there's incest and all that, but that's not really true.'' The actual origins of the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people are obscured by fallible memory, folklore and prejudice. Knowledgeable people agree the community represents a complex amalgam of white, black and Indian heritage. Yet the exact racial blend remains disputed with some anthropological authorities challenging the tribe's mainly oral account of its own history. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who directs the Ethnic History program for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, argues that <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s people derive from a handful of freed black landowners of Dutch heritage originally from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who eventually found shelter in the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the early 1800s

 <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> made his case in a book, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ramapo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>,'' that he wrote in 1974 after living for several months in the community. The Handbook of North American Indians, a basic reference work, accepts his account. In his book, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> also tried to debunk as folklore a story that <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s people find their beginnings in English and West Indian prostitutes who escaped from British troops stationed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. One of the sailors who brought the women was supposedly named <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and even today some outsiders refer to <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s people as `` Jackson Whites.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> is now viewed by many in the community as persona non grata because he argued for the primacy of black, rather than Indian ancestry. `` I think <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was a little bit out in left field,'' says <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s cousin. `` He had a racial problem, I think.'' Though community members present a range of skin tones and racial features, leaders say <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> families have always considered themselves American Indians descended primarily from <ORGANIZATION> Lenni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lenape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> indigenous to the area. They say their community has always maintained some form of tribal leadership, one of the criteria they must meet to satisfy the federal government of their authenticity. Today's tribal council includes three members from each of the Ramapos' main communities, all within about a 10-mile radius: <LOCATION> Hillburn </LOCATION> and, on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> side of the border, <LOCATION> Mahwah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ringwood </LOCATION>. Those three communities also constitute geographically defined clans: <LOCATION> Hillburn </LOCATION> of the deer, <LOCATION> Mahwah </LOCATION> the fox, and <LOCATION> Ringwood </LOCATION> the turtle. <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON>'s own Indian name stems from his people's belief that a red haze enshrouds the bones of a true Indian. But the <ORGANIZATION> Ramapo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> need more than their own beliefs to gain <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s seal of approval. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapard </PERSON>, branch chief of the Acknowledgment and Research Division of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says it's difficult for many communities to demonstrate to the government they're Indians. He said they must show, among other requirements, that they've been viewed by the surrounding community, other tribes, and state agencies as a separate community from the first contact with European settlers until the present. `` It's a very lengthy process at this time,'' <PERSON> Shapard </PERSON> says. He notes that his department this year can handle only three or four of the more than 100 petitions for recognition pending nationwide. The <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people have already achieved some acknowledgment from their states. Both the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> have recognized them as a legitimate tribe. Still, the far-flung <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people must make an especially difficult argument in order to join the more than 500 federally acknowledged tribes. Their people, though concentrated in <LOCATION> Hillburn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mahwah </LOCATION>, are strewn from the southern <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as far south as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Even in their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> border communities, the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people mingle in varying proportions with other residents. `` Not being on a reservation,'' <PERSON> Redbone </PERSON> says, `` you do n't really get the closeness.'' The administrative review process can take up to 10 years, according to the tribe's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people hope to sidestep the difficulties and bottlenecks at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> by pleading their case right to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which does, in rare instances, act to recognize a tribe by a simple majority vote of both houses. Some local outsiders fear recognition would herald a land claim by the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people, similar to those of other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tribes, that would put their property in jeopardy. They are uneasy with the prospect of an Indian reservation exempt from many state and federal taxes and regulations. Following the lead of many tribes around the country, the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people hope eventually to derive a hefty income from high-stakes bingo profits. They have turned to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who's bankrolling the recognition drive with about $ 250,000. In return, the <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> people will let him and another private investor from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area run the bingo operation. Frank estimates the games will rake in up to $ 12 million annually, which he will split roughly half-and-half with the tribe for the first 10 years. `` Naturally, the big thing with this is providing employment for members of the tribe,'' he says. `` It also provides a living for me.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ To <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, who spent years in the wilds of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, elephants are special, endearing animals. In her book, `` Elephant Memories,'' she tells why, describing the close familial relationships and bonding among elephants. `` I want people to know that so they care enough to save them,' she says.

 <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, native of <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, philosophy major at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and magazine researcher-reporter for four years, took a five-week vacation when she was 27 to visit a friend in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I went to see one of the last wilderness areas, but I ended up falling in love with the country,'' she says. And later with elephants. So much so that without any scientific training, she has become an authority on the elephants of <ORGANIZATION> Amboseli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and has published an account based on 13 years of observing the population and its behavior through periods of drought and scarcity, plentiful rain and overabundance. She watched as poachers, <PERSON> Masai </PERSON> warriors, injury, disease and tourists interfered. Some survived. Some did not. Her book, `` Elephant Memories,'' tells much about the intricate bonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout their lives. It's a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings of relationships, from the most intense, the mother and her newborn calf, to the mother and her other immature offspring, through family units, bond groups and clans. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchs in times of drought. Confirming the powers of elephants' memories, they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was most likely to survive and so they managed. In tough times, she found, elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively. She saw that family members will risk danger, charging the poachers to protect their own, while more distant clan members will run. `` The book is not just about numbers,'' says <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, director of elephant research in the park. `` I want people to realize how special elephants are. How funny, how endearing they can be. I want people to know that so they care enough to save them.'' She writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other after a separation, or as young males gleefully play-fight with each other. She writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calf tries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life and tries over and over to hoist it to its feet. She writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains as they come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them, throwing them in the air, perhaps to decipher the correct obituary. One prestigious critic, who liked the book, accused her of anthropomorphizing the behemoths. `` That's a rather out-of-date thing to say,'' retorts <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. `` A scientist would not make that accusation. That is all part of field work.'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> considers herself lucky for getting a head start in her field work by being offered a research assistant's job by <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON>, a pioneer in using extensive photography so that he could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in a study in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> worked with him for several years before embarking on her own. `` Today, it would be almost impossible to do it the way I did it,'' she says. `` For someone with no field experience to get a paying job would be almost impossible.'' She estimates that her research, paid for mainly by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Merlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, probably cost $ 100,000 for her nearly 20 years in the wild. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> did not live all alone for long periods, such as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodall </PERSON> did initially in her studies of chimpanzees, or the late <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> in her gorilla work. Other researchers were nearby.

 `` Because we were all expatriates and interested in the same things, there was a real camaraderie,'' she says. But she was out alone most days in her research vehicle following the elephants, observing, photographing, taking notes that would later be fed into the computer. The elephants had both descriptive names, such as Slit Ear, and three-digit code names more palatable to computer analysis. It is still a hard life. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> suffered through bouts of malaria and tick fever and was once badly frightened when menaced by a black mamba, a snake whose bite is fatal. `` The thing I do n't like about mambas is that they refuse to run away like any other law-abiding snake,'' she says. She has shooed leopards away by shouting at them, endured mock charges at her vehicle by the elephants and had her camp `` totaled'' by elephants when it was left unguarded and the smells of fresh bananas and other delicacies overcame whatever inhibitions they had. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> found love among the elephants a remarkable process. When bull elephants are in must _ ready to mate _ they show swollen temporal glands on their cheeks that exude viscous liquid. The bulls also exude a green substance from the business part of the anatomy, which she first mistook for some kind of infection or disease. She tells about a young female, a bride the first time, who did n't know the rules after breeding with a powerful must male. A more experienced female sticks close to her consort for three or four days, insuring that less-powerful but greatly interested other males keep a safe distance. This novice kept wandering off from the must male, drawing instant pursuit from the lesser males, who would n't have ventured close with the must male on hand. He was forced to thunder across the plain to drive off his rivals. Because of the duration of her study, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> was able to note this female had learned proper etiquette by the time she was ready to breed again. Some of the interesting tidbits, such as the fact that elephants also communicate on an infrasonic level, are not directly from <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>' research, but interwined with other researchers. Her decision to pack up and move to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> years ago was made easier by the fact that she had no immediate family in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the time. Both her parents had died and her only sister was living in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. She wrote an earlier popular book, `` Portraits in the Wild,'' which deals with the life of a field worker. She has published her findings in a number of scientific journals, but because she is not professionally trained, she concedes, she may not get full respect in some quarters. She holds no rancor. `` I ca n't apply for funds from certain organizations. I was terribly lucky getting started the way I did.'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> objects strongly to some park's practices of `` culling'' the elephants, killing part of the population to keep the numbers under control. `` Elephants are not so many rodents to be exterminated; they deserve something better than that and I am not afraid to say that ethics and morality should be essential considerations in our decisions for their future,'' she writes. `` Killing the elephants seems the simplest and most direct solution, but only to people who have not watched individuals over 14 years; have not seen the elephants greet one another with trumpets of joy; seen elephants, adults and calves alike, running and playing across an open pan in the moonlight; seen elephants trying to lift and hold up a stricken companion; seen a female stand by her dead baby for four days; or seen a 7-year-old calf gently fondle and stroke and feel the jaw of his dead mother.'' `` I wrote this book,'' she says, `` to share this.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ A new `` reconstruction'' era has come to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> as a result of the oil bust and historical landmarks throughout the state have fallen on hard times. Many of the antebellum mansions that were eventually restored following the Civil War are back on the market because of the economic crunch.

 After the Civil War, the once-elegant plantation mansions along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> hid their poverty behind moss-draped oaks, their spacious lawns overgrown with weeds. The Reconstruction era saw house after house fall into ruin, victims of an economy destroyed by the war and the end of slavery. Finally, the 1950s brought the oil boom and a stable national economy and people began looking for ways to invest and enjoy their money. Homes on the National Historical Register became tax shelters and those antebellum mansions were purchased by the dozens and restored. Now, a new `` reconstruction'' era has come to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, one created by another war of sorts, an economic one that sent the price of oil to the bottom. Historical landmarks throughout <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have fallen on hard times, especially those operated by the state government, which faces an accumulated deficit of $ 2 billion. And many of those proud old mansions are back on the market. One of them is owned by <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, who remembers trudging down the dusty river road as a youngster, with little money and no thought of a future, past a wonderful old house named <PERSON> Tezcuco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> eventually prospered because his mother sold newspapers to send him to college. He bought Tezcuco, which was built in 1855 by a Mexican War hero, and restored it to its original grandeur. `` When I was a boy I hated what had happened to Tezcuco,'' says <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, a retired major general who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and made his fortune in real estate and the auto business. `` The owners put a tin roof on the house because it was cheap and they'd keep painting it different colors _ green, red, you name it.'' Alas, <PERSON> Tezcuco </PERSON> is up for sale again, with a price tag of $ 1.9 million, along with another mansion <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> owns in <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>, Miss. `` It's the economy. Times are bad and it's a buyer's market,'' sighs <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisville </LOCATION> real estate firm is also trying to sell other antebellum homes. History is taking it on the chin in other ways, too. Across the state, the museum system has been cut from over $ 3 million in operational funds to $ 1 million and even the famous Cabildo in the French Quarter _ seat of government in 1795 _ is open only on a part-time basis. `` Not all of our buildings are open. The ones operating are open Wednesday through Sunday,'' said state Museum Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefcik </PERSON>. `` The Cabildo is open on that basis. We just do n't have enough staff. But, these are tough times and we have to recognize that.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucvalt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> physician, has offered to donate Mintmere Plantation, dating from 1857, to an <LOCATION> Iberia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> cultural district if the district will assume a $ 237,000 mortgage on the land. But the parish, like the state, is hurting for money and has not yet taken up <PERSON> Boucvalt </PERSON> on his offer. And, across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>'s Tezcuco, the awesome <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> can be bought for just under $ 5 million. `` They were good tax shelters and they still are,'' says <PERSON> Zeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON>, one of seven heirs joining a foundation to sell <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alley </ORGANIZATION>, which is perhaps the most picturesque home in the state. The highlight of the place is the lane leading to the front entrance, one created by 28 live oak trees thought to be up to 250 years old. More than 70,000 tourists paid $ 5 each to visit Oak Alley last year and those fees plus bed-and-breakfast money pay for the day-to-day operations, <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> says. However, he says, the mansion does n't take in enough money to pay for major maintenance work. The house and outbuildings are owned by a foundation set up to take donations to preserve <PERSON> Oak </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. `` But people are n't as interested in saving old houses as they are in helping the poor, the starving,'' <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> says. `` I certainly understand that.'' Nearly all antebellum homes are open to tourists for fees and many of the owners take in bed-and-breakfast guests. But not all of the homes command the big prices. In downtown St. <PERSON> Francisville </PERSON> sits Propinquity, built in 1809 and used in the Civil War as a sanctuary for Confederate soldiers, who stayed in the cellar as the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rolled by. The asking price is $ 250,000. `` Times are bad and I just ca n't afford the notes,'' says <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, the owner. His real estate firm also is trying to sell <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION>, built in 1808 and used as an inn for travelers on the <ORGANIZATION> Natchez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trace </ORGANIZATION>. The two-story estate with stately columns can be purchased for $ 750,000, <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> says. The 10-acre estate also includes two smaller houses. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> wants $ 250,000 for the antebellum house in <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>. `` It was owned by Governor <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>,'' he says. `` He was governor when <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was a territory. I had it open for tourists but closed it years ago because I could n't find a good manager.'' <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> and owners of the other properties are n't worried about ultimately selling the houses because there are many people around the nation like <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Kermeen </PERSON>, who owns The Myrtles in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisville </LOCATION>. `` I'm from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and I took a trip down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about nine years ago on a steamboat,'' <PERSON> Kermeen </PERSON> says. `` I heard this house was for sale and knew immediately it was for me.'' <PERSON> Kermeen </PERSON> left what she called `` a mellow'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lifestyle and settled in at The Myrtles, which was built in 1796 by General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, who fled his native <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> after leading the ill-fated 1794 Whiskey Rebellion. `` I live in this house. I love it here,'' <PERSON> Kermeen </PERSON> says. `` Sometimes I wo n't leave the house for a week.'' She operates a bed-and-breakfast operation, gives guided tours and has plans for a large hot tub on the grounds for guests. `` I'm fortunate,'' she says. `` I have other sources of income. I can afford this lifestyle.''

 Nearly five years after it was written, `` Chess'' has found its way to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. The musical has survived the illness and death of its first director, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>; technical and set problems that nearly capsized the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> opening, and a confusing flurry of on-again, off-again announcements about its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> production which fed speculation that `` Chess'' had been checkmated for good. `` It has been slow, but I do n't think that really matters,'' says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, the man who wrote the lyrics and co-authored the new book for the $ 6 million musical, which mixes a love triangle with a U.S.-Soviet chess match. `` It's very important to get things right. This time, it's just a regular ordinary panic,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> laughs. `` But every show goes through that.'' The other day, before the first Broadway preview, the genial, 43-year-old Englishman was sipping coffee in a Madison Avenue hotel, happy that the postponements are in the past. `` The only reason ` Chess' has been delayed, in all honesty, was because of the tragedy of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>,'' he says. `` When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> got ill, we lost our director with 12 weeks to go before the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> opening. We had this enormous set and show and no one quite knowing what to do with it.'' <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the man behind `` Cats,'' `` Les Miserables'' and `` Starlight Express,'' stepped in to supervise the West End production. He was up against an expensive and recalcitrant computerized set involving scores of television monitors. The tinkering by technicians was frantic but everything was finally made to work. The show, which opened in May 1986, became a sizable hit and is still running. `` <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> had saved us, but he then was totally booked up for the best part of two years,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says. `` We thought it was best to wait for him for Broadway.'' While the show waited, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and others refined the show. Several new songs were added to the score which has music by <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulvaeus </PERSON>, two members of the rock group <ORGANIZATION> ABBA </ORGANIZATION>. Playwright <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> came aboard to help redo the book. More spoken dialogue was added. `` ` Chess' is not based on anything else,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says. `` It's not an adaptation of a classic or a piece that has no story whatsoever. It's not meant to be just a spectacle. It's meant to be a story.'' The expensive <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> set designed by <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> was jettisoned for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The English production on Broadway would have cost $ 12 million and require a two-year run just to pay back its investment. But there were other reasons that <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> reworked his design. `` I think we got carried away in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with the set, which was fantastic, but which took away from the plot,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says. `` It made a lot of the situations seem unreal. You'd see songs that were being sung in some futurist bathroom and what we were just trying to do was tell a story about real people.'' `` Chess'' is <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s first Broadway musical without <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, his partner in three consecutive Broadway successes _ `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> <PERSON> Superstar </PERSON>,'' `` Evita'' and `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> commuted to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> during much of 1983 to work with <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ulvaeus </PERSON> on the score. Recording sessions began in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late that year with a cast _ <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Korberg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> _ that would eventually appear in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage version. Releasing the show on record was a tactic <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> had used to great success with `` Jesus Christ Superstar'' and `` Evita.'' It allows songs from the show to find a public. When `` Chess'' was released as a two-record set in late 1984, several numbers proved popular, particularly `` One Night in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>.'' `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they played it as a disco record and it was a massive hit,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says. `` I doubt whether many people who bought the record understood it came from a show.'' Another song, `` I Know Him So Well'' was a No. 1 seller in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but fared less well in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> says, because <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> stations </ORGANIZATION> just would n't play it Helping put `` Chess'' on stage has only been a small part of <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s current activities. He runs a cricket team, writes books on the sport as well as on pop music, supervises a publishing company and occasionally performs as a singer and actor. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> has a book about cricket and art _ paintings about cricket _ coming out in the fall. He's an enthusiastic booster of the game, which mystifies most Americans. `` American football is instant and very easy to understand once it's explained,'' he says. `` Cricket -LRB- one game -RRB- can take five days and even then you may not have any results. To be honest, it's more like chess than any other game. `` The great thing about cricket is the social side of it,'' he adds. `` Long tea intervals, sandwiches and sitting on the lawn in deck chairs.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> also has a passion for pop music, a sound he heard first as a child in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. His father was the Far Eastern representative for an English aircraft company and <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> would listen to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. It was the days of `` Rock Around the Clock,'' `` The Ballad of <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>'' and `` Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.'' `` Almost any pop record released from 1957 to 1967 I love with total lack of discrimination,'' he says.

 The gold-mining industry is the powerhouse of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy, the strongest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the fuel is the ore dug from thousands of feet below the surface by blacks, supervised by whites and barred by apartheid from advancing in their jobs, or even living where they want.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of feet below the cornfields of <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, men are at work 20 hours a day in heat, dust and danger, digging out the ore that feeds <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s $ 15-billion-a-year gold industry. Ninety percent of them are blacks, barred by apartheid from advancing any farther in an industry that drives <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s economy In this mine, 3,600 feet below the corn, there was no breeze to cool the sweaty brow this day. The only sound as the day shift started its work was that of the men, carrying drills, picks and shovels, as they trudged in heavy boots through the mud toward a band of dark quartzite that signifies a gold-bearing reef. The men had stripped down to short pants to work in the 90-degree heat of the mine, hanging their outer pants, jackets and shirts on pegs or beams along the walls of the tunnel. The danger was there, as it always is, when their drills started screaming into the rock and the men hacked with picks and shoveled the rubble aside, preparing holes for the explosives that would blow the ore loose. About 800 miners a year die on the job in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, from rockbursts caused by underground pressure, tunnel collapses, poisonous fumes, fire and other accidents. This part of the work _ digging out the ore _ is for the unskilled and semi-skilled, for the blacks, who put in the the longest hours for the lowest pay. They operate the drills, the ore carriers, the air hoses and pulleys, but the highest position they can hold is that of team leader, which pays up to 1200 rand -LRB- $ 600 -RRB- a month for directing operations at the rock face. That's still 200 rand -LRB- $ 100 -RRB- less than the lowest-paid whites in the mines. The blacks are prevented by law from handling explosives, a job that would qualify them for the supervisory positions leading to management. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has about 18,000 employees, with 28.5 percent from nearby <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, the enclave kingdom within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; 25.6 percent from <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>, a South African black homeland; and 29 percent, including 9 percent whites, from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s four provinces. As the men worked this day, sweat streamed down their faces from under the plastic safety helmets worn by the 13 black team members and their white supervisor. The screaming water drill sprayed tiny granules of rock back into their faces and bare chests. The drilling bore the holes for the placement of explosives to blast the ore loose, then came the shrill whistle of the air hose used to clear the holes. The noise was deafening. <LOCATION> Anglo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company is negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 60 percent of black employees in its mines, to require miners to wear ear muffs because the noise of the drills and blasting eventually affects hearing. `` There is a tradition of deafness being something to be proud of, indicating long service, but we just ca n't accept that,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, section manager of No. 5 shaft. This shaft, one of six on <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION>, produces 70,000 tons of ore a month, from which about 17,600 ounces of gold is extracted. It is one of seven adjacent mines that together produced about 4 million ounces of gold in 1987 for <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest mining company. The average black miner, prohibited by law from advancing up the ranks to supervisory work, earns 650 rand -LRB- $ 325 -RRB- in cash a month _ five times less than the average white mineworker _ plus room and board at Anglo American mines. The company has threatened to take <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid government to court over the law, which is being rewritten. <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> is also quietly defying government restrictions on where its employees can live, allowing some single black men, such as engineers, to live in housing designated for whites. According to 1950s projections, Western Holdings Mine should have been abandoned by now, but the current price of gold, hovering around $ 450 an ounce, makes mining low-grade sections feasible. After the men at the rock face finish their day shift, a new crew takes over to collect the gold ore and the day shift rides the elevators back to the surface. The whites go home; the blacks go to hostels where they are required by law to live. Anglo American is trying to combat the law, which requires black miners to live in segregated, single-sex hostels on mine property, while their families must remain in far-off rural tribal homelands or even in other countries. The law does not apply to the foreign whites, many of them from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. In addition to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, black miners at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> come from nearby <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Anglo American is subsidizing apartments and houses in the black township of <LOCATION> Thabong </LOCATION> for many of its black employees who want to live with their families and can afford it. Many are single, and many others do not want to give up their rural homes, or are foreigners whose families can not come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A few thousand probably will get to move into the homes in <LOCATION> Thabong </LOCATION> when they are completed. The rest will remain in the hostels, sending money to their families and visiting them once or twice a year. At the hostel for the No. 5 shaft, 5,146 black men live in a setting with the combined atmosphere of a prison, a college dormitory and an English boarding school. Eight to 16 men sleep on bunk beds in each room. The men take their meals in a central kitchen for each of the 10 dormitory blocks, which are mixed tribally. The complex includes a sports field, a technical training center and a bar.

<DATELINE>LE FORNET, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From the crumbling manor he shares with his sheep, <PERSON> Adolphe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnevie </PERSON> frowns into his field glasses at a <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> caught between star wars and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> XIV. He is not cheered by the presidential campaign around him. `` What will change, whoever wins?'' he asked, expressing a common view of the likely re-election of <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` What changed in the last seven years? More unemployment, the same problems.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilliaert </PERSON> made a similar point: `` People believed in ideologies in 1981. They elected <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> as a Socialist, to bring about change. Now they see their problems are beyond ideology. They'll vote for a person, not a party.'' Across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, people echo <PERSON> Bonnevie </PERSON>'s concerns over jobs, technological competition, agriculture, education and urban problems. Few are willing to express more than guarded optimism. Unemployment is 10.5 percent. Last year's trade deficit of $ 5.5 billion was 60 times higher than in 1986. Economic growth of 2 percent lags far behind <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s. But more, Frenchmen see an erosion of culture and a breaking down of the fabled art of living that once set <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> apart. Old roots are dying, and new growth is too sparse. Around villages like <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornet </PERSON>, tucked away in a back corner of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>, the `` crisis'' takes tangible shape. <PERSON> Bonnevie </PERSON>, an aging farmer, owns most of the village, old stone buildings, cobblestones and a patchwork of fields. He sits in the sun and trains his binoculars on passersby. Most are in ski clothes. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornet </PERSON> is three miles from Val d'Isere, which in preparing for the 1992 Winter Olympics, has hurtled itself into the space age. A sleek train rockets skiers straight through the mountain, to the top of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Daille </PERSON>. <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Isere </PERSON>'s relaxed little main plaza has vanished below a gigantic hotel-mall. The last remnants of the past, a stone home built in 1642, a generation before <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XIV </PERSON>, the Sun King, are hardly visible amid a forest of garish signs. `` This is a ski factory,'' grumbles <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON>, who sold his <ORGANIZATION> Squaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and is moving to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` They have lost all the flavor, the old way of life, and they'll never get it back.'' In <LOCATION> Albertville </LOCATION>, headquarters of 1992 Winter Olympics, old regulars still shuffle into the Cafe des 4 Vallees and wait, without a word, for <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> to bring their `` petit blanc,'' their glass of wine. But the cafe, redone in plastic and formica, no longer serves <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s hallowed melted ham and cheese sandwich, the croque monsieur. Now there is a goopy microwaved substitute called Love-Croquy, sold along with `` les Love Double Cheeseburger.'' On Easter Sunday, the baker lady was selling brioches at Au Peche Mignon. `` <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, someone else, what's the difference?'' she said, with a merry laugh. `` I'm still working every weekend.'' Down the mountain in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, the heart of old-style <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a conflict of ages is evident in the modern new neighborhood called <LOCATION> Part </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dieu </LOCATION>, which translates roughly to `` God's Little Acre.'' Futuristic trains cut the old time in half, to two hours, from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'s high-tech Part Dieu Station. But the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> car-rental office closes four hours for Sunday lunch. The huge Mr. Chef cafeteria advertises, `` Open 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., even Sundays,'' but it closes for lunch, at 2:30 p.m. Campaign posters cover every flat surface of Part Dieu, but few people questioned in the street say they think any of the candidates can make headway against underlying problems. Most pictures show the jovial face of <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>'s favorite son, who warns that any serious economic recovery will take at least two years of job retraining His rival conservative for the chance to run against <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in the May 8 runoff is Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, who argues roughly the same thing with a flashier style. Posters also tout arch-conservative <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who argues foreign cultural pollution is taking <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from the French. As a dark horse, his ads call him: `` L'Outsider.'' `` It makes no difference,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Duranson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> driver who prefers sports to politics. `` All of them want the same thing.'' He patted his wallet pocket. `` They clean up, and then they go.''

 A malaise was reflected in l'Express magazine. A poll indicated 54 percent of a sample of the nation's elite thought <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was in decline. The country is finding it costly to retain the grandeur of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>'s defiant defense and foreign policies. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is quietly moving closer to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Recently, 1,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines from the 6th Fleet came ashore for a two-week exercise, the first on French soil since 1966. Economically, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is to blend into a unified European system by 1992. `` Our motherland is <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but our future is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> put it. Less easily defined signs indicate a concern that traditional French values and tastes are at risk. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s main plank is to send home immigrants, fueling racism among those who worry that 2 million people of North African extraction will curdle the melting pot. Ironically, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s far-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has taken votes from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, replacing the old left as the place for disgruntled workers to register their protest. Even dyed-in-the-wool <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> supporters expect their candidate to poll less than 7 percent, half of their 1981 showing and less than a third of their high-water mark after World War II. More generally, middle class French parents worry that youths are growing up selfish, without depth or respect for traditions. Few see campaign programs that might counter the trend. For a large number, it is a cultural vacuum, especially on television. The two private channels licensed last year, amid great hoopla, show only 24.5 percent original French programing. One offering is Sexy Clips, in which nude couples stress togetherness in ways outlawed in some American states. On `` La Roue de la Fortune,'' a perky Frenchwoman turns letters for contestants who spin a giant wheel to decipher a blanked out message. In French, the show's name means, `` The Wheel of Fortune.'' There is also, `` <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prix </ORGANIZATION>'' _ `` The Price is Right.'' Both French productions are licensed by the shows they copy. At 8 a.m., viewers choose among Daffy Duck, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Panda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>. The pay channel, Canal Plus, retransmits the CBS Evening News in English at that time, and it is fast gaining popularity. Some Frenchmen worry that much of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is falling into foreign hands. Foreigners bought up $ 1 billion worth of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> real estate last year, a fifth of the market. Japanese investors built an office complex at <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> where once <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> could barely afford a cup of coffee. Most important, people are caught in the middle as the country meshes with the modern world, but old ways foul the gears. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has made it clear that in a second term, he would set aside Socialist dogma in favor of letting <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> find its own pace. He told an interviewer: `` The country is headed toward a free-market economy, and so let's play it to the hilt. Let us have no half measures.'' But now there is `` OPA,'' an acronym, meaning corporate takeover, that is a new French fad word. When <ORGANIZATION> Schneider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified holding company, tried to take over the industrial automation group <ORGANIZATION> Telemecanique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrique </ORGANIZATION>, however, workers blocked it by marching in the streets _ the way <LOCATION> Frenchmen </LOCATION> have done since the Revolution that broke the Sun King's line

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Beetlejuice''; ``The Seventh Sign''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` Beetlejuice'' Sometimes a devilishly dynamic performance lifts a movie out of the ordinary. That happened last year with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s satanic furioso in `` The Witches of Eastwick.'' Now comes <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> in the title role of `` Beetlejuice.'' <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> outroars a banshee. His head rotates with a velocity of which <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> never dreamed. He is so unspeakably, devotedly evil that he becomes almost lovable. It's a great comic performance that redeems the obvious crowd-grabbing strategy behind `` Beetlejuice.'' Curiously, the movie begins much the same as `` The Witches of Eastwick.'' The camera hovers over a picture-postcard <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> village and travels through the immaculate streets and freshly painted buildings to focus on a hilltop house that looks a bit huge for its surroundings. The occupants are a pair of cheerful yuppies, <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geena </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose main occupation appears to be puttering around the mammoth house. Their work is interrupted when they drive into town for supplies. On the return they swerve on a covered bridge, land in the river and drown. Rather confusedly, they return to the house as ghosts slightly less sophisticated than <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in `` Topper.'' Their lives continue much the the same, though invisibly, until the house is sold to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. He moves in with his death-obsessed daughter, <PERSON> Winona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, and his second wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, who is hellbent to transform the house into a chic monstrosity. Alarmed by what is happening to their house, the yuppies seek help from the after-life bureaucracy, a useless exercise. Finally, they enlist the infamous <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> who rises from his grave to perpetrate his monstrous deeds. Director <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' -RRB- is a former <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> animator, and his film has the kinetic energy of a cartoon. There is also a synthetic plot, credited to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaaren </PERSON>, which affords little of the logic needed for a convincing fantasy. Unrecognizable in his weirdo makeup, <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> behaves outrageously; it's a marvelous characterization. Also helpful are <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- `` Ferris Beuller's Day Off'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> -LRB- `` SCTV'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Winona </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> as the invaders. `` Beetlejuice'' was produced by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release is rated PG, mostly for its scare quotient. Running time: 92 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Seventh Sign'' An intense man walks purposely through the sands of a beach in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. He stares ponderously at the sea, breaks a small, round token and tosses it and a piece of parchment into the water. Almost immediately, sea life washes up _ dead. This purportedly foretells the coming of the apocalypse _ the ultimate destruction of evil and triumph of good. It is the first of seven signs, and in the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> movie, `` The Seventh Sign,'' only one woman can stop it. The woman is <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>? <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the Brat Pack? <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> who is also Mrs. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> -LRB- `` Moonlighting'' -RRB- <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>? <PERSON> Demi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> who is about as compelling on screen as Gumby? What in the name of <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Karloff </PERSON> is she doing in a `` serious'' occult thriller? However, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s tepid performance in the Tri-Star Pictures release is only one problem with this meandering and misguided movie. One by one, the signs happen: A village is frozen in the middle of the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert; a river runs with blood; hail the size of a baseball falls in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; there's an unexpected eclipse in which the moon becomes red. Interestingly enough, no one in the news media, science or government takes any notice. The stranger -LRB- <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prochnow </PERSON> -RRB- rents a room from <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who are played by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Biehn </PERSON>, who limps through his role, and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abby </PERSON>, who is seven months pregnant, discovers more tokens and parchments in his room and takes one of the pages to a rabbi for translation. But she offends him and instead gets assistance from the scholar's brash young neighbor, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> -RRB-, who not only tells her that she's up to her agnostic chin in the apocalypse but also becomes her sidekick. Meanwhile, hot on the heels of the <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s boarder is a priest named <PERSON> Lucci </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> -RRB- who is investigating the strange signs for the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Is he good or evil? If you can sit through another 20 minutes of the movie, you'll find out. While <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> tries to figure out how to stop the apocalypse, her lawyer husband tries to save his client, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, from the gas chamber. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a 20-year-old who has Down's Syndrome, gives an excellent and sensitive performance as the tormented <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, who killed his mother and father in God's name because they were brother and sister _ incest was against the way of God. <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> has constant flashbacks to another time in history: little flickers of a centurion; a tortured man of goodness; a woman holding a water vessel. It's easy to figure out who is who and what is what, especially since the movie was released during the Easter-Passover season. What's not easy to figure out is why the filmmakers did n't pay more attention to organization and sense in their production, and plug in the many holes that make `` The Seventh Sign'' the eighth wonder of muddled movies. The <ORGANIZATION> Interscope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION>, with a script by <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicket </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, is saved only by the lovely and dramatic photography of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Anchia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>'s sets. The movie is rated R for strong adult themes and some nudity. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Fatal Attraction,'' that slice and dice lust thriller starring <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, is finally being released as a video from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. The Academy Award-nominated movie _ for best picture, director, actress and screenplay adapation _ was the film industry's biggest moneymaker last year, selling $ 150 million worth of tickets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. With its themes of adultery, terror and mental instability, it still draws lines at some movie theaters. If you missed this one on the big screen, you can buy it for the small screen beginning June 1 -LRB- VHS @ Beta, $ 89.95, Rated R -RRB-. Paramount also is releasing a dubbed, English-language version of the Oscar-nominated `` My Life as a Dog'' on April 20. The subtitled original of the Swedish language movie by <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON>, concerning a Swedish boy learning about life and death in the 1950s, will be released on May 18 -LRB- VHS @ Beta, $ 79.95 -RRB-. Out this week from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> is one of the best contemporary rock films ever made, `` <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>: Hail! Hail! Rock' n' Roll'' -LRB- VHS, $ 79.95, Rated PG -RRB-. When the tribute to the legendary <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> premiered at last year's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, critics and audiences cheered. Also on the market this month: `` Date With an Angel'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS, $ 89.99, Rated PG -RRB-; `` Deadly Illusion'' -LRB- RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video, VHS @ Beta, $ 79.95, Rated R -RRB-; `` Flowers in the Attic'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS, $ 89.95, Rated PG-13 -RRB-; and `` Dancers'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, $ 89.95, Rated PG -RRB-. Videos reviewed this week: `` Dancers'' When this <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> movie starring <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> first came out in October 1987, it pirouetted right off the screen after a thrashing by critics. `` Dancers'' is not the greatest ballet movie ever made _ it will never fill those red shoes. It was directed by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who also did `` The Turning Point,'' but falls short of his earlier effort. Still, the movie seems to find a comfortable niche on the home screen: Somehow, it's more believable and engaging. The plot revolves around <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyev </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> -RRB-, the world's star male dancer. He's also a ladykiller who's in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to film a production of `` Giselle.'' There are sexual innuendoes and flirtations and some excellent performances by the American Ballet Theater. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, who starred with <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> in `` The Turning Point, appears as <PERSON> Anton </PERSON>'s ex-lover. The ABT's <PERSON> Alessandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON> also co-stars.

 `` Deadly Illusion'' Get a giant cauldron, drop in <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, Vanity and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> and what do you get? A soupy, unappetizing mess called `` Deadly Illusion.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> plays a private detective with the improbable name of <PERSON> Hamberger </PERSON>. His repeating line throughout the movie is, `` Please, no jokes about the name.'' Vanity, whose leather and lingerie cover her lousy acting, plays his girlfriend and assistant. Fairchild, who has a brief, lusty romp with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, is the villain who sets up <PERSON> Hamberger </PERSON> for murder. <PERSON> Hamberger </PERSON>, ever so friendly with the local police, is given 48 hours to prove his innocence -LRB- sound familiar? -RRB- and find the real killer. Forget the action, forget the thrills: There are n't any. Nor is there any slick dialogue in this movie written by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who co-directed with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tannen </PERSON>. With two directors you'd think they'd be able to keep their geography straight. Not these guys. They have <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> racing through <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. He looks over his shoulder, turns a corner and in a blink is downtown in the Wall Street area in the same chase scene. Not even the best marathon runner could accomplish that.

 `` Birth, School, Work, Death'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ The Godfathers For a while there, it seemed like bands from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had forgotten how to rock and roll. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s island lately has produced an overabundance of frothing pop and synthesizer-drenched angst. Now along come the Godfathers, with a sound as vaguely sinister as their name. The Godfathers combine classic 1960s rock song structures with the aggressive cynicism of punk. Frankly, they'd be lost in the crowd if placed in either of those two eras, but the current lack of energy makes the Godfathers stand out. The title track of `` Birth, School, Work, Death,'' performed with a sneer by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, puts the `` life stinks, then you die'' bumper-sticker philosophy to music. In the process, it sums up the working-class frustrations that course through the Godfathers' music Unfortunately, cliches litter their writing, and nowhere is it more evident than here. Far better is `` If I Only Had Time,'' with a melody that leaves a more lasting impression than the chanted chorus of the title cut. `` If I only had time,'' <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON> sings, `` I'd think of the perfect crime. Guitarists <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dollimore </PERSON> shine with a sloppy exuberance, leading one to believe their own personal godfather is <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. They're at their best in the rockabilly `` S.T.B.,'' and the droning lead guitar salvages the silly psychedelia of `` When Am I Coming Down?'' In sound and stance, the Godfathers could be British cousins to the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Satellites, minus the sense of humor. Their youthful energy wins them more respect than their songs at this point, but the Godfathers are worth keeping an eye on.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Celebrity Finds Judge Reinhold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judge <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> has his own gauge on how fast celebrity can overtake an actor in today's <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` The week before ` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop' opened, I was asked to show two pieces of ID to cash a check at my bank, where I had an account for two years,'' he related. `` The week after the film opened, I had a family in a station wagon scream at me on the freeway to pull over for an autograph.'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> has been on a roll ever since, adding to his credits `` Off Beat,'' `` Ruthless People,'' `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II.'' His current release is `` Vice Versa,'' in which he changes identities with his 11-year-old son, played by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>. Yes, he realizes that the plot parallels those of `` Like Father, Like Son,'' but he claims priority. `` Our story was taken from a children's book written in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1880. A very popular, enduring book that's still popular. It concerned a duke who switched consciousness with his son. There was a movie, ` Vice Versa,' made with <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> in the early 1950s.'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> admitted he was at first reluctant to undertake `` Vice Versa'' because of the similarity to `` Like Father, Like Son.'' But as soon as he was committed, he jumped into his research. `` I hung out in video arcades and gymnasiums,'' he recalled. `` I was once asked to leave a playground by the police because I was just standing around watching the kids. I did n't have the nerve to say, ` Do you know who I am?' So I just left quietly.'' In the early stages of `` Vice Versa,'' the actor was concerned about the casting of his son: `` I knew the kid would make or break the film. We saw a lot of kid actors who had a lot of kid-actor tricks they knew adults would respond to. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> had none of that. He came in like a little <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and just took the part. `` As soon as <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> was cast, I knew we had something special,'' he said. `` He's got this comedy timing that must be God-given; I do n't know where else he could get it. We became real pals. I had him record all my lines, and I recorded all his lines, so we'd go home and study each other's inflections and nuances.'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> showed the completed film to his mother and asked if he had been anything like the kid in the movie. Her reply: `` Oh, no, you were much more obnoxious.'' He was born <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, but at the age of 2 he looked so much like a judge that the name stuck. He grew up in comfortable surroundings. His father was a trial lawyer and the actor remembers him as an aloof man whose command of a courtroom probably fostered his son's acting ambitions. `` I was pretty comically oriented as a kid,'' he said. `` That was how I got attention.'' After drama classes in four Eastern universities, <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> spent a year playing a variety of roles in stock and dinner theaters. When his father died in 1977 he moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He worked in a frozen yogurt store by day to finance his night acting classes at the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>. His arrival in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was perfectly timed. `` I hit town in 1977, and in 1978, ` Animal House' came out and opened up a whole new genre of youth-oriented films,'' he recalled. `` I was plucked up pretty fast.'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> appeared in such films as `` Stripes,'' `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' `` The Lords of Discipline'' and `` Gremlins.'' As the rookie detective in the megahit `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop,'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> hit the big time. He followed with `` Head Office,'' `` Ruthless People'' and `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II.'' But <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> now figures playing the goofy guy can be too much of a good thing. `` I'm at an important point where if I continue along these lines, people are n't going to accept me any other way,'' he said. `` I really do want to have a well-rounded and enduring career, do all kinds of different things. Much as I love comedy, I will have to hold back right now. `` I did my first dramatic TV movie with <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON>, ` Promised a Miracle.' It's about two fundamentalist Christians who take their diabetic son off insulin and he dies three days later of insulin shock. It's a true story, very powerful stuff. I want to do more dramatic work.'' Despite his newfound fame, <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> feels a trifle uneasy: `` Sometimes I feel I'm pushed into a place where I'm supposed to be more special than somebody else. I do n't feel real comfortable with the idea that because I'm somewhat famous, I'm more special. That means I'm working.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Tate Gallery Purchases Explosive Jackson Pollocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> was the American artist who abandoned brushes and dripped and splashed paint straight from the can onto canvases laid out on the floor and walls. His work was controversial in his lifetime and it has been argued about ever since he died in a car crash in 1956. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Tate Gallery has no doubt of his importance, and the state museum of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and 20th-century art has just doubled its holdings of <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> works to six from three. It says that's more than any other museum outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewison </PERSON>, the Tate curator responsible for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art, said no other state museum in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has even one <LOCATION> Pollock </LOCATION>. `` The Tate now has <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s finest collection of American abstract expressionism,'' he said. That is the term for the painting style of <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and his fellow artists _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON>. An alternative term was `` action painting,'' the invention of critic <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> liberated the application of paint,'' <PERSON> Lewison </PERSON> said. Sir <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowness </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s director, is a <LOCATION> Pollock </LOCATION> enthusiast and dismisses with a smile claims that <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and the other members of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> of the 1940s and'50s were not true artists. `` I am quite sure that <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s place in the history of art is secure,'' he said in an interview. `` The three paintings we have acquired are classic masterpieces and not simply innovative new art. `` <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> was the first great American painter and one of the major artists, if not the major one, of the mid-20th century. He had a sense of his importance because he was the first to make paintings like that. His work has elements of the work of <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, but he did something completely new.'' The three Pollocks, `` Birth,'' `` Summertime'' and `` Number 14,'' were painted between 1941-51. They had been on loan to the museum since 1982. The director would n't say how much they cost, but said it was `` rather more than we would receive from the government in any one year.'' The Tate's 1988 grant from the government for the purchase of pictures is $ 3.375 million. The record price for a Pollock painting was the $ 2.5 million paid at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last May for `` Number 26,'' painted in 1950. <PERSON> Bowness </PERSON> recalled that when he was appointed director in 1980, the Tate had three Pollocks and one of his priorities was to obtain more. `` I went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at the end of 1980 to talk to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON>, a very remarkable lady and an undervalued artist in her own right,'' he said. `` She wanted to see her husband's work properly shown internationally and loaned us these three works which her husband had retained during his lifetime.'' Shortly before she died in 1984, <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON> agreed to sell them to the Tate over a four-year period because the museum could n't afford them all at once. The purchase has been made from the <ORGANIZATION> Pollock-Krasner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is funded with the bulk of <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON>'s estate, and has granted more than $ 1.5 million to some 300 `` worthy artists who are in need.'' <PERSON> Bowness </PERSON> praised the foundation, saying he thought it a fine thing that money from the sale of art should be `` recycled'' to help artists. The most striking of the three works is `` Summertime,'' just under 3 feet high and nearly 18 feet long, like a frieze. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> laid out the canvas on the floor in 1948 and poured and dripped paint and enamel over it in swirls and patches. The painting, first seen at the <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>' Gallery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1949, expresses a sense of exhilaration and joy. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> wrote at the time, when he was living near the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>: `` My concern is with the rhythms of nature ... the way the ocean moves. ... I work from the inside out like nature.'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> liked to paint on a big scale. Born in 1912 in <LOCATION> Cody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, his canvases took on the characteristic of what he called the `` vast horizontality of the land'' in the American West. His nephew, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer whose father, <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, was an artist. Another uncle, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, was also a painter. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> attended a recent reception at the Tate to announce the Pollock purchases. `` Painting was always treated seriously in my family,'' recalled <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` It had true meaning then _ something I think impossible to conceive of now in the late 1980s. It was n't about the monetary end of it, but the genuine concern with the action of painting.'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was 8 years old when his uncle died so he does n't remember too much about <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> as an artist, although he does recall his uncle giving him his first bicycle. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> lived on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at that time, and while the boy visited his house, `` his studio was not a place one toured lightly,'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> said. `` But young as I was, my childhood was infused with the belief that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> was an important painter.'' He said with a rueful grin: `` My father eventually stopped painting to make a living. He went into printed circuits for rockets.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Opinionated Rockers From Down Under</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since releasing its first album in 1978, the Australian rock group <ORGANIZATION> Midnight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has taken on a wide range of issues: the environment, human rights, the arms race, unemployment. `` Diesel and Dust,'' their latest LP, is no exception. Songs such as `` Beds Are Burning'' and `` Dreamworld'' warn about coming to terms with a changing world. `` The Dead Heart'' attacks exploitation of aborigines in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Warakurna'' is a demand for a better life. The group's lead singer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, is not the type of person who keeps his opinions to himself. `` I am prepared to debate anybody,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who is recuperating from a leg injury suffered during a recent show. `` I grew up in a household where politics was not a dirty word. `` I have a great interest in what's going on. I have opinions but I also want to be able to back it up.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>'s interest in the affairs of his country go beyond making records. He has written newspaper columns on current issues, taken an active role in trying to rewrite the Australian Constitution and, most prominently, ran for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 as a candidate for the Nuclear Disarmament Party. `` The major politicians tried to make fun of the issue. They said it was simplistic, emotional, single-issue, naive politics,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who was narrowly defeated. `` They alienated everybody who liked rock music. It changed people's attitudes. `` I was surprised that the leading politicians were lying. We were trying to tell the truth.'' Midnight Oil was formed in the 1970s and released its first album, `` Midnight Oil,'' in 1978. While they have yet to achieve major popularity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, their records have consistently sold well in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In 1982, the LP `` 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1'' reached No. 1 and went triple platinum. `` Red Sails in the Sunset,'' released in 1984, also topped the Australian charts. Midnight Oil contributed royalties from 1985's `` Species Diseases'' to a trust fund for peace and disarmament. They have performed at countless benefit concerts. `` We're making our people understand we've got a part in their lives,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` We care about the price of the T-shirts. We're not pop stars on a guided tour. The band's not that kind of band.'' Besides <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, the band features drummer <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirdt </PERSON>, guitarist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotsey </PERSON>, guitarist and keyboardist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moginie </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>. All the songs on `` Diesel and Dust'' are credited to Midnight Oil. And all the songs are about <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` We find so much going on in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` We're never without something to write about. Midnight Oil has spent considerable time helping aborigines, an ancient tribe whose plight has been similar to American Indians. They have toured aboriginal communities and on `` Diesel and Dust'' included the song `` Bullroarer,'' which refers to an aboriginal musical instrument. `` The bullroarer is used to provide warnings when sacred ceremonies are being undertaken by aboriginal people,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` Having gone into the desert and spent time with them has given us a shot in the arm about trying to write about these things.'' Because <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is still a member of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and has extensive relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> is especially conscious of the impact those countries have on his native land. On `` The Dead Heart,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> sings of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>: `` We do n't serve your country, do n't serve your king. `` The Queen is still head of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. `` Our constitution is in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> also has been critical of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially of its policy of bringing nuclear armed warships to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He acknowledges, however, the enormous influence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had on his country. `` You're very conscious of the headmaster, the bully. That whole thing of size and power and strength and vitality. Awesomeness that ca n't be escaped,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` You're eating it; you're consuming it as entertainment It affects your standard of living. It's always there. It's like the sun.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> also believes that being an Australian as opposed to an American band has helped Midnight Oil stay in touch with its fans. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it's quite natural to have stars,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, we tend to view each other as just people.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> insists, however, that he is not anti-American. `` I've said some terrible things about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but there are parts of it which I think are terrific. Although <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> spends a great deal of time focusing on the problems of his country and the world, he is far from pessimistic about the future. The last song on `` Diesel and Dust'' is called `` Sometimes.'' The last words of `` Sometimes'' are: `` You do n't give in.'' `` This is not end of the world music,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` There's always hope _ that's what it's all about.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s Salad Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Early in 1937, a brash, dashing actor named <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had a call from one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s biggest and most important filmmakers, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON>. He wanted Fairbanks to play the bad guy in a remake of `` The Prisoner of Zenda.'' Fairbanks, although happy to have an offer, was upset. `` I was set back on my heels at being asked to be a supporting or featured player to anyone _ even so fine an actor as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>,'' he recalls in volume one of his new autobiography, `` The Salad Days'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION>, $ 19.95 -RRB-. What to do? Only one person to turn to, the one person he never wanted to use to further his career: His father, the great silent film star whose romance with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickford </PERSON> made them a celebration of the movie world. So fierce was young Fairbanks in wanting to make it on his own, he even considered changing his name. `` But the minute word got out, I knew there would be too much publicity so I did n't,'' he said in an interview. `` Those feelings toward my father are hard to recapture. I suppose partly I did n't want to emulate him. The theatrical hero of my youth was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>.'' He had long sought his father's approval, he said, and finally got it with `` Zenda.'' Fairbanks Sr. told his son to take the part: `` Because not only is ` The Prisoner of Zenda' one of the best romances written in a hundred years ... but <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hentzau </LOCATION> -LRB- the role Fairbanks would play -RRB- is probably one of the best villains ever written. He is witty, irresistible and sly as Iago.'' Young Fairbanks, of course, went on to star in the movie, creating one of the most sophisticated villains the screen world has ever seen. It remains his favorite role. The `` Zenda'' tale is but one tasty morsel in the autobiography, a veritable salad bar of celebrity browsing: He was married at the age of 19 to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>; the marriage lasted a blink. He had an affair with <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> and was once greeted by a bobby as he left her hotel room by a fire escape early one morning. The book is punctuated with the famous of the day: <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Niven </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> is too much the gentleman and bon vivant to assault his readers with a lusty `` kiss-and-tell'' book. `` I tried not to be sensational; I just tried to tell it straight,'' he said. `` Kiss-and-tell books are the easiest things to do. Instead, <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> leads a friendly tour of his family, his youth, his movies and finally his diplomatic work for President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> during World War II. Volume one ends in 1941, and he's already started the concluding volume It was Doubleday's idea to do two books. `` <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> took three volumes to tell his story,'' <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> said with a wink. Fairbanks started writing the book three years ago, in longhand, but his experience dates back to his teen years when he started writing for Vanity Fair. Why did he begin an autobiography at this time in his life? `` A publisher came along with a good offer. It's as vulgar as that,'' he said with that string-of-pearls smile that once caused grown women to blush. `` I think if I had my druthers, I'd prefer to be a writer more than anything else,'' he said. `` I think I'd like to be a painter next and an actor last. But I would rather write about something else than about myself.'' The hardest problem in writing the autobiography, he said, was `` trying not to sound pompous or sounding like <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> _ you know digging my heels in the ground and saying, ` ah shucks,' and being overly modest.'' Fairbanks has appeared in 75 films and has produced others, including `` The Exile'' in 1948. He also collaborated on the writing for the movie, a talky swashbuckling period piece set in the days of Charles II. His last movie was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>'s `` Ghost Story'' in 1981, co-starring with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON>. `` Ah yes, ` Ghost Story,''' he said quietly with a reflective smile. `` It was very sad. <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' character dies in the movie and during shooting he quipped, ` I'm learning how to do it.' He died a few months later.'' If Fairbanks could turn back the clock and do it all over again, he said he'd like to have performed more classics. `` Everyone's done ` Hamlet' or they think they want to,'' he laughed. `` I would like to do ` Faust,' by <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON>. But I'd rather have written ` Faust.' ... `` I like production _ it's part of creating. But to interpret one's own creation must be fun.'' However, his regrets in life are not profound ones, he said. `` My biggest regret is not having writtten a play. `` I believe very strongly that you should follow your star. It does n't matter if you succeed as long as you make the effort.'' Fairbanks, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, still cuts a fine figure of elegance with his silvery hair and classic features. But the pencil-line mustache is gone. `` Do n't worry, I'll grow it back,'' he laughed. `` I just took it off to do something different and to see if anyone would notice. No one did.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Tiny Tim's Falsetto Has a Twang</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>'s stringy, long black hair is now tinted with crimson. He still throws kisses in rapid-fire fashion and plays a pearl-inlaid ukelele. But his piercing falsetto now has a touch of twang, and he proudly wears silver cowboy boots and a huge silver belt buckle with a gold `` T'' in the center. The outlandish singer who shot to stardom 20 years ago with `` Tiptoe Through the Tulips,'' is trying for a comeback as a country music singer. He's released a country record titled `` Leave Me Satisfied'' for the small NLT Records label of nearby Burns, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The song is about a plea from one lover to another as a breakup unfolds. Despite his turn to country music, the 55-year-old performer says, `` I have n't forgotten my high falsetto.'' It's his second foray into country music since his heyday when he married `` Miss <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>'' -LRB- <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Budinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- in 1969 on `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' Ten years ago he recorded a since-forgotten song called `` Country Queen'' about a cowboy who did n't get noticed as a singer so he decided to dress like <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> by donning a huge wig. More recently, <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> has been the headliner for two years with <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s Great American Circus which played one-nighters in dozens of dusty small towns from March to November. He was billed as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Very Own Eternal Troubadour.'' He says about his legacy: `` I'm the first long-haired, white-faced singer _ before KISS, before the Beatles. And I'm the first ` has-been' star to sing with the Great American Circus.'' <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaury </PERSON>, was wearing white pancake makeup and sporting long locks 30 years ago, and he remains the focus of attention wherever he is. He said his unusual appearance and mannerisms during his TV performances years ago set him apart from other entertainers: `` The mail came in like mad. People were asking, ` Where'd you get him? What a shock! Ma, you got ta see this creep!' `` The people want something new all the time. -LRB- Boy-next-door -RRB- <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> could n't even get arrested, and I came along.'' In addition to his current country music career, <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> stars in a dcumentary movie, `` Street of Dreams,'' which is to premiere in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in late May. In it he sings 139 songs for more than two hours. A few years ago, he acted in the movie `` Blood Harvest,'' portraying an insane clown. The movie had distribution problems in this country but should be released soon in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. He and Miss <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> were divorced in 1977. She has remarried twice since then; he married <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alweiss </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> graphics artist, in 1984. Millions of TV viewers watched <PERSON> Tiny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> get married on <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s show, where their vows included a pledge never to get `` puffed up.'' In an interview, he said he believes <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> suggested the wedding take place on the show in order to raise ratings in the face of a challenge by another late night show hosted by <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. `` He's a competitor,'' Tiny <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> said. `` He saw this as a shot in the arm. He succeeded.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, he said, bought $ 10,000 worth of tulips and paid for Miss <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>'s gown. `` I'd have never married her but I did n't want to break her heart,'' he said. `` I really did love her, but I could see some problems.'' They had a daughter, <PERSON> Tulip </PERSON>, who will turn 17 in May. She lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and is studying computer science, he said. Miss <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, he said, is living near <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` I'm not in touch with her.'' He estimated that he was a guest on <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s show 10 to 12 times, the last one in 1979. That time, he sang a song about the gas crisis, `` Tiptoe to the Gas Pumps,'' and did his version of <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s `` Do Ya Think I'm Sexy,'' in which he rolled on the floor in a burst of showmanship. But the song he's most associated with is his 1968 recording of `` Tiptoe Through the Tulips.'' `` It flowed well with the high voice,'' he said. `` It was sung in a different sound. People said, ` Hey, what's that?' It had a great melodic theme. Melody is 99 percent of every song. `` But no radio station wanted to play it at first,'' he recalled. `` A DJ in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, went on strike over the song. It was going against the odds, but good ol' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> did n't let me down They began playing it there, and then it hit in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. By June 1968, it was the big hit of the year.'' How does he want to be remembered? `` He played his part well,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Group To Ask Airline Stockholders For Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A national anti-smoking group says it plans to ask shareholders of major airlines to do what it says the federal government has not done: enact a total ban on smoking during all domestic flights. <PERSON> Ahron </PERSON> <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION>, said in a weekend interview the group will attempt to arrange shareholder votes at major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines over the issue. <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON> said the new federal law that will ban smoking on domestic airline flights of two hours or less beginning April 23 is a good first step but contains loopholes. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used a time limit rather than mileage, airline flights scheduled for just under two hours could escape compliance, he said. Flight time can be altered by the rate of climb, flight altitude, the type of aircraft being used, headwinds and the schedule of the airports involved, <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON> said. The federal ban on smoking during short-term flights will expire in two years if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes no further action, but <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON> does n't expect that to happen. Nevertheless, his Cincinnati-based group does not want to wait for two years to get further action. <PERSON> Leichmtan </PERSON> said the group planned to take the issue to the annual stockholders' meetings of every major airline. In addition to seeking a total smoking ban, the group wants airline executives to designate 50 percent of all flights over two hours as smoke free. The group chose <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to announce its new strategy because <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, based in the suburb of <LOCATION> Eden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, already has banned smoking on nearly all of its domestic flights, <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON> said. He said the group planned to go to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and tentatively <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where other major carriers are based to raise questions about the health, safety, economic and legal issues raised by passenger smoking on aircraft, he said. `` We are going to attempt to prove to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that increased carbon monoxide levels caused by smoking in airplanes puts a flight attendant at risk by reducing the ability to think clearly,'' <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON> said. He suggested that smokers be provided with nicotine gum or nicotine pills if they could not otherwise physically handle smoke-free flights.

<HEAD>Dollar Advances In Europe, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in early European trading today as investors positioned themselves for this week's meeting of finance ministers from the major industrialized nations and the latest set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. Gold prices were mixed. Dealers said they were expecting ministers from the seven major industrialized nations to reaffirm their strong opposition to a further decline of the dollar at their meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday. The meeting, in conjunction with the semi-annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, was n't likely to generate any market-moving news, dealers said, but a reaffirmation of a stable-dollar policy may still help the dollar. The market is also in a bullish mood because traders are speculating on a narrower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for February _ between $ 11 billion and $ 12 billion _ when figures are released on Thursday, dealers said. January's deficit was $ 12.44 billion. `` In the long run, the dollar is heading upward, and this is already influencing its medium-term trend,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnirel </PERSON>, foreign exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 125.71 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it rose to 126.42 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6790 West German marks, up from 1.6725; 1.3916 Swiss francs, up from 1.3825; 5.7050 French francs, up from 5.6715; 1.88465 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8790; 1,246.80 Italian lire, up from 1,241.75; and 1.2420 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2478 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound It cost $ 1.87 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8755 late Friday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 450.40 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 450.15, both down from late Friday's bid of $ 451.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 449.80, up from $ 449.50 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 84 cents to close at a bid $ 451.95. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> this morning at a bid price of $ 6.43 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 6.48.

 The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market indicator surged to a new closing high today, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar gained ground in trading against the Japanese yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which shed a modest 20.33 points last Friday, gained 175.98 points, or 0.65 percent, finishing the first day of the week at 26,924.87. The Nikkei's close today surpassed the previous high set last Thursday when it closed at 26,768.22. Monday's close was 278.44 points above its pre-crash best level of 26,646,43, set the week before the worldwide stock market crash last October. `` Boosted by the last week's advance on Wall Street, the Nikkei average went up to less than two points short of touching the 27,000-point level,'' said <PERSON> Fumihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. The index reached 26,998.36 points, the highest ever, at one time during the morning trade. Investors spread their buying through most sectors amid bullish sentiment, traders said. The dollar's stability dispelled whatever doubts investors may have had about <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stocks, they said. In the afternoon, however, <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> said concerns that the market was rising too high prompted profit-taking, and the selling eased prices a little. Advancing issues outpaced decliners 531 to 351, while 173 issues were unchanged. Popular issues were electricals and precision machineries. Constructions and housing stocks also rose. Insurances and securities were firm. Volume of the first section trade was an estimated 900 million shares, down from 1.5 billion shares last Friday. In the foreign exchange trading, the dollar closed at 125.71 yen, up 0.53 yen from its close of 125.18 yen last week. It had opened the day at 125.80 and traded between 125.68-125 .83 yen `` Trading was quiet and the dollar moved very little,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Iiya </PERSON> of the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He said most participants watched from the sidelines, waiting for results of the scheduled meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week of monetary authorities from the seven major industrialized nations and the announcement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week takes up a $ 1.1 trillion budget plan accompanied by far less acrimony than usual because it complies with last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The fiscal 1989 budget proposal drafted by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the committee, has received bipartisan support in committee The election-year budget does n't propose new tax increases, beyond the $ 14 billion already enacted for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It also avoids eliminating any spending. The plan was crafted to stay within the overall spending limits of the deficit agreement, which pre-set totals for military, foreign aid and domestic agency spending. Within those guidelines, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal is closer to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s priorities than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan approved last month. It includes a 27 percent increase in spending on the space program and trims back development programs that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed to kill. The Chiles-Domenici plan also endorses <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to give a 4.3 percent pay hike to the military and only 2 percent for civilian federal workers. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted a 3 percent across-the-board raise. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans envision big increases in spending on AIDS research and education grants. Like the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided to adopt the administration's optimistic view of the nation's economy By doing so, the plan claims that the deficit will be just $ 136 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. The non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> forecasts that the deficit will be about $ 35 billion higher. The budget resolution is a guideline for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' fiscal legislation, and it does not require the president's signature. However, it has often passed weeks or even months past the April 15 deadline as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration battle over spending priorities. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action this week and a speedy House-Senate agreement could make for the earliest budget approval in years. The deficit agreement with the president settled for the year what normally is the biggest battle _ the balance between domestic and military spending. Under the agreement, the budget includes $ 299.5 billion in budget authority and $ 294.0 billion in outlays for the military; $ 148.1 billion in budget authority and $ 169.2 billion in outlays for annually appropriated domestic programs, and $ 18.1 billion in budget authority and $ 16.1 billion in outlays on foreign aid. Budget authority, the legal authority for agencies to spend their allowances, often differs from cash outlays because the government does n't always spend what's authorized during a single fiscal year.

Per-share earnings fell to 62 cents a share from $ 1 a share. Revenue fell 5 percent to $ 2.4 billion from $ 2.5 billion. Commission revenues, a significant portion of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s business, fell 33 percent to $ 440 million from the year-earlier record quarterly total of $ 654 million, which the company attributed to reduced stock market activity Like other investment giants reacting to the October crash, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> instituted or accelerated staffing and cost reductions, anticipating leaner times in what historically has been a cyclical business. `` Given the relatively lower level of activity in the financial markets during the quarter, these results demonstrate the broad-based strength and diversity of our core business operations,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. `` We are also beginning to realize the impact of the structural cost-reduction programs initiated during the previous quarter,'' <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, said: `` Obviously, 1988 will be a year of challenges and we are confident that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> is well positioned to meet them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> is one of Wall Street's largest full-service investment firms, with capital of $ 2.86 billion.

The company has a workforce of about 2,500 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> cited a victory in a related case to bolster his contention that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> judgment would be overturned on appeal. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> successfully sued in 1982 to block the federal government from providing water to the slurry pipeline project. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> appealed, but higher courts upheld the decision, including the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in February. `` In view of the unanimous decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> case,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said, `` we expect our position to be vindicated.'' The slurry pipeline was proposed to carry a mixture of pulverized coal and water between <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and several southern states. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> had a contract to supply the pipeline with water from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for 50 years, which would have brought $ 9 million a year in revenue to the state. The suit contended <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> and others violated federal antitrust laws in delaying the 1,400-mile, $ 3.8 billion pipeline, which would have crossed railroad tracks. Attorneys for the state produced a document that said <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> was designated to be the lead railroad to fight the project and the water sale. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> argued that it opposed the pipeline, but that there was no conspiracy. The company also contended that the project was financially doomed regardless of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s water contracts. The jury verdict came amid <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s quest to acquire control of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> railroad. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to reject a competing offer from <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today sweetened its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 1.19 billion, topping a bid from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm in the contest for the textile giant. Under terms of the new offer, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 67 for each of the 17.8 million <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> shares outstanding. The offer, which is not conditioned on financing, will expire at midnight EDT April 22. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s sweetened offer tops a $ 64-a-share tender offer launched by <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which announced last week that it has commitments in place to finance its $ 1.14 billion bid. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> board twice has backed Odyssey in its buyout efforts. Under terms of an agreement reached with Odyssey, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> board said it would pay the firm up to $ 8 million if the New York-based textile company is acquired by a third party for more than $ 64 a share. In early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> rose 62 -LCB- cents to $ 66.62 -LCB- a share. Odyssey had charged that a <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> merger with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would violate antitrust laws. But <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> said today it reached agreement last Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the terms of its offer, which include selling certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has proposed selling half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about $ 170 million. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> approved the definitive agreement for the sale <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had signed with <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the textile manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Bidd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also waived waiting requirements under federal disclosure laws but may required <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to sell a sheeting mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, which operates a number of state-of-the-art sheet and towel plants. The company also has licenses for lucrative designer labels including <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Givenchy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Burberrys </LOCATION>. Bidding for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> began after it received a leveraged buyout offer from a group led by its own senior management, including Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ a fifth-generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813. The management group initially offered $ 43 a share and later sweetened its bid to $ 55 a share in cash and securities. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money repaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, last month launched a $ 62.50-a-share tender offer after <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had reached an agreement with Odyssey on a buyout at $ 61.50 a share.

<HEAD>Soar 77 Cents a Barrel on OPEC Speculation, Shifting Market
Sentiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil prices jumped 77 cents a barrel early today to the highest level since early this year, which traders attributed to speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would enlist outside producers to restrict world supplies. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for May delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> intermediate crude jumped from $ 16.88 per 42-gallon barrel Friday to $ 17.65, an unusually large move that put prices at the highest point since Jan. 5. Experts differed over whether the rise was a short-term development or reflected a reversal in what has been a dismal oil market. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> thing is clearly the reason, there's no question about it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dea </PERSON>, manager of international energy futures at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Whether it should be that strong or not, who knows. My attitude has been, talk is cheap with that crowd.'' The market move followed disclosures that leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would invite government representatives from at least seven independent oil-producing nations to meet with five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers on April 23. All 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are to meet two days later. The invitation, announced by a committee of five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers on Saturday, was seen as a clear acknowledgement by the cartel that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil supplies to support prices. Some analysts said the market's rise today reflected a more fundamental change in sentiment toward rising prices, and the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> development was merely an excuse to buy. `` This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of a bull move,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The real story is the oil market cycle has turned; it's ready to go higher.''

 Research ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Monday agreed to spend about $ 2 billion over the next five years on research in information technology. The plan, called ESPRIT II, is designed to help European companies to compete against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> official said the program, which involves 5,500 researchers from 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, represents about one-third of all European basic research in information technology. The official said ESPRIT research has led to numerous technological achievements, including the development of T800, the most powerful chip on the market. He said the current phase, which is to begin in late summer, will continue to center on microelectronics and information processing. Under EEC rules, the Community contributes 50 percent to the cost of each project, with the rest coming from the member states. For the first time since 1984, when ESPRIT was launchhed, the Community will allow non-member countries, mainly from <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, to participate.

 <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> on Monday increased the number of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shares it is seeking to acquire in its $ 2.18 billion hostile takeover attempt. Under terms of an amended tender offer, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 42 a share for 39 million USG shares, or 85 percent of the building materials company, up from the 21.5 million shares it initially sought for the same price. Remaining shares would be exchanged for securities and notes valued at $ 42 a share. With 51.8 million USG shares outstanding, the offer is valued at about $ 2.18 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which owned a 9.9 percent stake in USG when it launched the tender offer, said that about 12.6 million shares had been tendered as of last Friday. The latest offer, made possible by additional financing commitments, would not be subject to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> anti-takeover laws, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The offer is set to expire at midnight EDT April 22. USG repeatedly has opposed <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>' overtures and has urged its stockholders to reject a slate of board candidates recommended by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> group. Six of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 board seats are up for election at the May 11 annual meeting. Last month, Chicago-based USG, a leading producer of gypsum wallboard and other building materials, said it was considering defensive strategies that might include the sale of a major block of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> stock to a third party to block an unfriendly takeover. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it has received commitments for $ 1 billion of the $ 1.4 billion needed for the offer, including $ 500 million each from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s office looks more like the winner's circle at the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 than corporate headquarters for his $ 200 million-a-year business empire. Visitors have a hard time figuring out the color of the wall paint. Photographs and paintings of race cars and triumphant drivers accepting roses and trophies cover the office walls and line the corridors from floor to ceiling. But <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> is n't in the racing business _ at least not for a profit. Most of <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>'s income is generated by his broadcasting corporation and automobile dealerships. His success in those areas has allowed <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> to pursue his lifelong passion for auto racing, a preoccupation he adopted from his father. In 1973 <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> signed on friend and Indy 500 champion A.J. <PERSON> Foyt </PERSON>, creating the Gilmore-Foyt Racing Team. `` One of the greatest moments in my life was when A.J. won the Indy 500 for the fourth time -LRB- in 1977 -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, 61, a cheerful, gray-haired man whose blue eyes ignite with excitement each time he mentions racing. The feeling is obviously mutual with <PERSON> Foyt </PERSON>. `` I ca n't say enough about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>. He's stuck by me through thick and thin,'' said <PERSON> Foyt </PERSON>, who 15 years later continues to drive Gilmore-backed cars. Though backing a winner in the Indy 500 was a new experience, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> was already well accustomed to corporate victory. From his grandfather's profitable downtown <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> department store, <ORGANIZATION> Gilmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> has created a diverse business empire with about 1,000 employees. Of his three auto dealerships, the one in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is consistently among the top four Chevrolet dealerships in the country, selling as many as 21,000 cars each year, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> also recently announced he would become a partner in <PERSON> Foyt </PERSON>'s Chevrolet dealership in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> owns two <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> television stations, WEHT in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> KODE-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> radio stations, WLVE in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WIVY </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. Then there's all that real estate in downtown <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, including several office buildings and parking lots, and the 2,700-acre hog farm in northern <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. And more. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> also owns an insurance company, is director of a <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> plastics manufacturer and sits on the boards of two banks. He is a partner in the parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Kalamazoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> hockey team and part-owner of their stadium. He also has minority interests in a <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> advertising firm and an automotive engineering company in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. As if that were n't enough to keep him busy, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> serves on dozens of local, state and national commissions, ranging from the President's Council on Sports and Physical Fitness to the local chamber of commerce The parent company for his holdings, <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, has had annual revenues as high as $ 300 million. In 1985, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> listed <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> as one of the 400 wealthiest Americans, estimating his worth at $ 160 million. `` Forbes was close, but a little on the high side,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> says with a smile. Maybe so, but it's still not bad for a first-year college dropout who started out by mopping floors at the family department store. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> is quick to admit that most of the money he started out with was inherited. After his grandfather died, his grandmother married the founder of <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the pharmaceutical company, merging <ORGANIZATION> Kalamazoo </ORGANIZATION>'s two wealthiest families. But <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>'s workaholic and perfectionist tendencies have allowed him to make the most of his head start. After growing tired of working in the family's department store, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> was elected <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>'s youngest mayor, a position he held from 1959-61. A diehard Republican, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> remained active in politics for many years, heading five congressional campaigns for former Rep. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> also made an unsuccessful bid of his own for a congressional seat in 1980, two years after his first wife died of cancer. `` Running was one of the best things I did in my life, although losing did n't feel very good,'' said <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, the father of five grown children and stepfather to his second wife's four children. Though <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> contends he has no plans to get back into the political arena, he may be lured to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, if his good friend of 12 years, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, is elected president in November. `` I think we're good enough friends that there's a good possibility I might be asked to do something -LRB- in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, the public servant, also believes in continuing his family's tradition of philanthropy. Instead of sharing his profits with the community through a foundation after his death, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> says he believes in `` working on things while we're still alive.'' `` Every night when I get home from work, I put on a sweater and take a walk downtown and I take notes on things that need to be done,'' he said. And he does n't believe in procrastination. For example, when a <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> homeless shelter needed repairs late last year, <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> donated $ 30,000 for an immediate renovation. Maybe that's why A.J. <PERSON> Foyt </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> the diamond-studded ring that went with his Indy victory. `` When he gave it to me, he said, ` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, you may lose everything else, but you wo n't lose this.'''

<HEAD>Age of Designer Onions Has Industry All But Crying</HEAD>

 It may sound like a childhood nightmare come true: People buying specially wrapped gift boxes of onions. But this is the age of the designer onion, and industry officials say the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s grapefruit-size variety known as the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 1015 SuperSweet has onion enthusiasts crying for more. At least eight packers are shipping gift boxes from the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> at prices amounting to a dollar or more per onion. `` They'll put them in there with some of this Easter-type grass and ship them UPS -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> horticultural scientist who developed the 1015. Since 1974, Valley growers have helped fund $ 1 million in research grants for the continuing project <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> leads in the quest for a sweeter, milder onion. He released his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Grano 1015 _ named for the optimum planting date of Oct. 15 _ in 1983, providing increasing competition for sweet onions such as the sweet Vidalia from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` Grano'' in the 1015's name means it is a round variety, as opposed to flatter, `` Granex'' onions. `` It's helped us because it's got a lot more people eating onions that did n't eat them before,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBerry </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Progreso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Produce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` You can see that by the number of tourists who come by here asking for 1015s.'' On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of winter Texans drove up to his company near the border town of <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>, but the round, yellow 1015s were n't in yet. The sweet spring onions are only available for a six-week period beginning in mid-April. <PERSON> DeBerry </PERSON>'s company and others have started labeling the 1015s with individual stickers to help consumers who ask for them by name. `` Right now there's a national obsession for sweet onions, and I know that sounds strange,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouchek </PERSON>, executive director of the Harlingen-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging an aggressive national marketing campaign for the state's designer onions `` There's a lot of people who are really fanatical about them,'' she said. About 80 percent of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' onion crop is the sweet spring variety, said <PERSON> Erv </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandlin </PERSON>, a promotional marketing coordinator with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Onions last year brought $ 77.8 million to onion producers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, making it the top moneymaker among fresh vegetables, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierstedt </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Statewide onion acreage this year is nearly 19,000 acres, of which 14,000 is for the spring crop, <PERSON> Bierstedt </PERSON> said. About 3,500 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> acres are planted in the 1015. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' niche in the national market is that its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> spring crop hits the market early, growers say. `` We come off at a time of a year when the old onions are about gone and spring begins,'' said <PERSON> Othal </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> McAllen-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is the largest onion producer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Until the spring onions hit the market, consumers are eating the more pungent winter storage onions grown in many states. On an early spring afternoon, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, who is mayor of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, tromped through a muddy field to show off some of his earliest crop. `` Is n't that beautiful?'' Brand asked after pulling two of the bulbs up. `` The only thing prettier than that is money in the bank.'' Other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> onions usually begin hitting the market before the 1015s are ready. The drawback from the spring crop grown in the short days of winter is that they do not last long in storage, growers say. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said he is working on ways to store the spring onions longer. He also is researching just what makes the 1015 mild, and said it mainly is because of a low level of a substance known as pyruvic acid, which reacts with sulfur compounds to cause the things that give the vegetable a bad image. `` Very rarely will you get one that will bring tears to your eyes,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said. The 1015 also causes fewer stomach and breath problems, said <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who thinks that is why many people who do not eat onions will eat the mild ones of the spring season. Most of the 1015s weigh more than a pound, and some have been reported at three pounds, according to <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, who manages gift packages for <ORGANIZATION> Bartlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groves </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, said his company started shipping the special boxes of onions last year after shipping the more conventional gift citrus for several years. `` As a matter of fact, I still have a little trouble with it when you equate a package of onions with a gift package of oranges or grapefruits,'' <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Farmers May Be Willing to Consider Batus Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it was willing to discuss a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> if <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> follows through on a suggestion it may raise its $ 4.5 billion bid. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of the British conglomerate B.A.T. Industries, termed the letter `` an encouraging development'' and said it welcomed the chance for negotiation. Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer and seventh-biggest property and casualty insurer, opened the door to talks in a letter from <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` I am requesting hereby that you advise us without delay of any higher offer you are prepared to make,'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> offered to share confidential information disclosed to other potential suitors if <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> agrees to confidentiality guidelines. He set a Tuesday deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' response. On March 3, <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> launched an unsolicited $ 63-a-share offer for the Los Angeles-based insurer. In a letter Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehey </PERSON> said the company would consider increasing its offer if Farmers management would agree to negotiate. The issue is complicated by a dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> and insurance regulators in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, one of nine states in which Farmers owns insurance companies. A hearing is set for April 20 on a <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s order that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> stop soliciting proxies in support of a resolution that would require Farmers directors to reconsider their earlier refusal to negotiate <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> law requires regulatory approval of any change of control of an insurer, and defines control partly as holding `` proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities.'' `` We feel that we'll meet all the statutory requirements,'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> B.A.T. </ORGANIZATION>, a tobacco, retailing and paper-goods conglomerate, has been seeking a foothold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial services market for some time.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today defended its role in the hostile takeover attempt of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and denounced the `` bizarre allegation'' that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, rather than a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, was trying to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. `` From an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> viewpoint, not only do we think this to be a Shearson transaction and activity in the normal course of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> as ill-informed, provcative and ill-advised,'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, executive vice president of parent company <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was ill-informed because of the `` continued erroneous assertion that that somehow <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, rather than <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, which is simply not true and strikes the management of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a bizarre allegation.'' <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said it was unfair to characterize <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> as having taken an equity position in the takeover attempt. He said <PERSON> Shearon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> was providing advice and bridge financing for the transaction, both `` normal functions'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment banks. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> construction materials concern, said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> `` has dominated and actively guided every aspect of the planning and execution of the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> takeover attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s unsolicited cash tenderpoffer of $ 45 a share on March 3 has since been sweetened to $ 60 per share. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the British materials and construction firm that bears his name, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, `` I am not a corporate raider.'' <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said his firm was `` not the sort of organization that seeks to put people out of work, far from it.'' Commenting on <PERSON> Kopper </PERSON>'s refusal to try to negotiate a merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It appears to me that you can never know anything aboet an opposing side until you at least can hear their view.''

<HEAD>Privatization: If It's So Good, Why The Delay?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It is a tenet of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s philosophy, so deeply imbedded in his political approach that it might be referred to as a cornerstone of policy. Aspects of it were endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1982, by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Budget in 1984 and by a bipartisan presidential commission in 1988. Its efficacy has been shown when used at the local level and whenever practiced at the federal level. But privatization, specifically the contracting out of government services now performed in-house, has grown slowly. The reasons why are not surprising, since government has long been accused of footdragging. But, oddly, some of the skidmarks of reluctancy seem to have come from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> itself, in spite of its avowals of support. That curious claim becomes even more so since it is made in a paper from the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which is generally supportive of the president and has in the past been a font of ideas for the administration. The authors of the study, `` Privatization,'' subtitled `` A Strategy For Taming The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>,'' states that `` the most disheartening obstacle to contracting out has been the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration's lack of initiative ...'' Editors <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> cite a 1985 <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> study of 22 federal agencies showing that in a three-year period half of them awarded no service contracts to outside firms as the result of cost comparisons ordained by <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. Though making the story even stranger, some background also sheds light on at least one the reasons why: Government regulations _ the same ones meant to encourage contracting out _ put the outside contractor as a disadvantage. Reading through the report, it appears that a self-serving bureaucracy rather than the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is the culprit, since the bureaucracy apparently has the power to frustrate the intent of top-level orders and goals. For example: In keeping with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> circular A-76, private firms must compete with in-house suppliers through a detailed cost-comparison process. The agency then must choose the least expensive alternative _ in-house or contracted out. But, according to <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, `` the cost-comparison procedure has been transformed by the federal agencies into a de facto moratorium on contracting out.'' The bureacracy defends itself well. Among other things, it handicaps the private vendor by skewing the meaning of `` comparison.'' The private bidder, for example, must beat the in-house cost estimate by at least 10 percent in order to get the contract. That's just the beginning. Unlike the government agency, the private firm must also include all indirect costs such as rent and corporate salaries, a process that places private bidders at about a 35 percent handicap. Even worse, the agency itself conducts the cost comparisons and awards the contracts. The bureaucracy, say <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, can delay the proceedings for as long as three years, `` so that very few contracts are ever awarded.'' They maintain that federal contracting-out policy `` is so routinely disregarded and so fervently opposed by the federal bureaucracy'' that only a forceful statement by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can put it back on track.

 Soviet fertilizer plants will be equipped with high-technology production control equipment under a multimillion-dollar venture announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet government ministry. The deal was announced as a group of 400 Americans led by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> arrived for trade talks with Soviet officials. Prospects for more such joint projects, which the Soviets are promoting to help stimulate their economy, are a main topic for the talks of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertilizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> are forming a company that will design automated control systems for factories under the ministry's jurisdiction and is expected to sell to third countries as well, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. The Soviets hope to boost their fertilizer production by using the new technology, thereby also improving harvests in the weak farm economy. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> will own 49 percent of the company and the Soviet ministry will own 51 percent, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. The company has been named <PERSON> Sterch </PERSON>, after an endangered species of Siberian crane that was saved by U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the 1970s. A <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> statement said the company's investment in the initial marketing and design phase will be about $ 1 million. <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> told a news conference that once the joint venture begins installing the production control equipment, purchases from <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> `` could reach somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 20 million volume'' in the first year of operation. Because the Soviet ruble can not be exchanged for hard currency, the method of receiving profits is a major problem for Western firms trying to set up joint ventures with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said that under Soviet legislation adopted in September, the minister of the Soviet fertilizer industry has access to some of the country's hard currency earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>'s future income from the project will depend on increasing the quality and quantity of the fertilizer that can be marketed to third countries, and on installation in other countries of systems in plants that the Soviets have helped manage, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. Most of the joint venture's employees will be Soviets, <PERSON> Verrant </PERSON> said. The agreement will be signed Thursday and official registration of the company may take a month or more. <PERSON> Giorgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Prityko </PERSON>, a top official in the Soviet ministry, said <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s 10 years of experience with a similar <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> system was an important reason the Soviets chose the Minneapolis-based company. `` We just adoped the experience acquired by our friends in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are expected to hear from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said last week he expects no breakthroughs in the talks, although they could improve the climate for greater U.S.-Soviet trade. He said he would stress that expanded trade can take place only if the Soviets make improvements in other areas such as human rights and emigration.

The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 30.8 points, or 1.7 percent, higher at 1,810.5, its best level for the day. Volume, however, was light at 405.4 million shares, down from 508.5 million on Friday. Share prices opened strongly, helped by recent rises in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In addition, shares, especially in the oil sector, were helped by news that representatives of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers were to meet to discuss ways to bolster the price of crude oil. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the world's fifth-largest oil producer. The dollar's rise, and consequent fall in the value of the pound, gave a lift to international stocks, and dealers said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers were seen in the market taking advantage of the more favorable exchange rates. Dealers said stocks surged to their best levels late in the day after the 100-share index held above the psychologically significant level of 1,800 points for most of the session. `` The momentum of having broken through 1800 has carried us on,'' a dealer said.

<TEXT>
 The pile of documents involving years of asbestos-related suits against <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has grown so large, it needs its own warehouse. The company announced Monday that it began operation of a storage plant for the paperwork _ 16 million documents in all. The warehouse operation in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> is available to those involved in resolving asbestos health claims against the company. It was established in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> Personal Injury Settlement Trust, the committees representing asbestos health claimants and other interested parties. The trust was established under the <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy plan of reorganization to settle asbestos health claims against the company. The former asbestos maker filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws on Aug. 26, 1982. The bankruptcy court for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the company's plan of reorganization on Dec. 22, 1986. The company sought bankruptcy protection because of thousands of lawsuits pending by victims of asbestos, which causes asbestosis, an often-fatal lung disease. The victims are seeking billions of dollars, and future claims are expected to develop. Experts testified that the claims totaled more than the company's entire worth.

<TEXT>
 The American public may be less willing than the television industry believes to embrace a high-resolution TV system with improved picture quality, clearer images and more brilliant color, according to a study released Monday. The results of the study, by the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, `` contradict the accepted wisdom ... which posits that high definition TV knocks the socks off everyone who sees it.'' The study found that, to most viewers, the differences between conventional TV and high definition TV, called HDTV, are subtle and that screens would have to be two to three times the size of sets found in most American living rooms to have a significant impact. The Japanese have been working on HDTV for nearly 20 years and are moving forward quickly. They plan to give a preview of their system with broadcasts of this summer's <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics to <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets in about 50 big-city department stores throughout the country. The picture on a standard television set in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is produced by a signal that scans more than 200,000 dots on 525 lines. The Japanese system has 1,125 scanning lines. Of the 613 people who participated in the study, 62 percent said they preferred the quality of HDTV overall. However, `` this indicates that HDTV is not the same kind of revolutionary shift in technology as experienced in the transition to color in the 1950s and 1960s in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a report on the study written by <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, and released at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention here. `` Although engineers and broadcast professionals see the difference immediately and stronly prefer HDTV ... the differences are more subtle to the untrained eye of the mass audience,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> is the most talked about development at this year's convention, which began Saturday and ends Tuesday Broadcasters are concerned that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research efforts to develop an industry transmission standard for HDTV, still years away in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, may not be moving fast enough to head off a probable Japanese invasion of the new technology. <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be introduced by the Japanese to homes in their country in 1990. The Japanese system requires more than the space allocated to TV channels on the electromagnetic spectrum. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the HDTV system called Hi-Vision will be transmitted by satellite to small rooftop antennas, avoiding the bandwidth problem that would be faced by over-the-air broadcasting. But special <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> receivers will be needed to see the enhanced picture. One of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasters' greatest fears is that the Japanese will begin exporting to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> HDTV video cassette recorders and receiver sets that would not receive over-the-air broadcast signals. `` We're fooling ourselves if we do n't think the people in the video cassette, cable and movie industries are going to take advantage of that,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which is developing a system that improves picture quality though not as significantly as the Japanese HDTV system. `` Broadcasters could be put out of business or severely hurt if we take too long'' to meet the competition with an improved television picture, he said. But <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>'s report said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public is unlikely to rush out to buy <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets, which are expected to cost upwards of $ 3,500 when first introduced. The Media Lab study, admittedly `` an early experiment,'' was conducted in a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in early December 1987. For 30 minutes, a total of 613 randomly selected shoppers, in groups of five to 20, watched a variety of programs on conventional and <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets. Though viewers could usually see a difference in picture quality between the two sets and overall liked HDTV more, they preferred a conventional picture for some of the programming, the study found.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> told a federal judge Monday his decision to set $ 2.475 billion in compensation for <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> victims helped kill a pending buyout of the pharmaceutical company. But a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which planned to acquire <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> the judge's ruling did not automatically destroy <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' pact with Rorer <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> listened to arguments on whether <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> should pay a $ 25 million `` break-up'' fee to Rorer plus $ 9 million in expenses associated with the failed merger. The Rorer-Robins pact, negotiated last November, included the $ 25 million fee to Rorer if the deal fell through. Its key provision called for paying $ 1.75 billion to women who suffered injuries from using the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, which <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sold in the early 1970s. A month after the agreement was reached, <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> determined that $ 2.475 billion was needed for Dalkon Shield compensation. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebsky </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, said the agreement with Rorer `` for all intents and purposes was a dead letter'' after the higher compensation figure was established. `` They were Siamese twins, and when one of the twins died the other went with it,'' <PERSON> Drebsky </PERSON> said of the Rorer merger and its $ 1.75 billion compensation proposal. But <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, the attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said his company had the sole right to withdraw from the agreement when the higher figure was set. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> had no such right, he said. Also, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> officials continued to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> executives after <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON>'s decision as if the two firms could adjust the terms of their deal to accomodate the larger compensation. `` <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> knew the agreement was not dead,'' he said. `` It was clinging to it'' in case talks with two other potential buyers, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Sanofi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a major European pharmaceutical manufacturer, fell through. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> accepted an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> offer in late January. The judges did not rule immediately on Rorer's request for the break-up fee, but <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> company would not receive all the $ 9 million in expenses. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> interrupted arguments on the dispute for about two hours Monday to allow the attorneys to try to work out a settlement, but no deal was struck. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, the Richmond-based maker of the Robitussin series of cough medicines and other pharmaceuticals, has been in federal bankruptcy court under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since August 1985. The chief issue in the company's reorganization has been payments to some 195,000 women with injury claims because of the IUD. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' merger with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and the Dalkon Shield compensation package will be voted on by creditors after ballots are mailed out April 25. Votes are due back July 11, and <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> has set July 18 for a hearing on confirmation of the reorganization plan.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> told shareholders Monday that a top priority this year will be eliminating about $ 3.6 billion in debt incurred in fending off Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s 1986 takeover attempt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> also said he expected 1988 earnings to surpass the $ 770.5 million earned last year, which included $ 257 million from discontinued operations. At the shareholders' meeting, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said that reducing debt caused by <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-takeover stock buyback plan would require several measures, including possibly divesting its interest in a joint pipeline. <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said a recent court ruling permitting the final segment of the All American Pipeline in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> should enhance the sale prospects. The pipeline is a project of Celeron Oil and Gas, a former <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary until it was sold last year as <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on its core tire business. `` Continuing advances in cost control, and keeping capital expenditures as close to depreciation levels as is competitively practical, should allow us to make some contribution to the debt reduction this year from operating income,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> added. `` In our assessment of the remainder of 1988, the global tire market looks promising.'' Meanwhile, Executive Vice President <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihelick </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> is considering building a new tire plant in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A 550-acre site in <LOCATION> Napanee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, about 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, could be home for a radial tire plant, subject to working out details with <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> authorities, he said. The <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> government has approved a $ 32 million loan to assist in establishing the plant. During the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union targeted <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> for negotiations toward a three-year labor contract that labor leaders say will set the tone for negotiations with the rest of the industry. A 12-member advisory committee on Saturday unanimously chose <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> over companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as the pattern-setting company, according to a news release from <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION>'s international president.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> opened <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to Americans in the early 1970s. Now his son-in-law is opening <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to more and better advertising billboards. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s eagerness to put up more billboards is a sign of progress in the Communist nation, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said Monday in announcing a deal between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` If you're going to have a market-oriented economy, the most important thing is free passing of information, and advertising is a big part of that,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a finance lawyer and the husband of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, acted as a go-between on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, which bills itself as the world's largest outdoor advertising company. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Media </PERSON> will give the Chinese advice on such matters as standardizing the sizes of billboards, upgrading its paint and attracting business from non-Chinese advertisers. `` An initiative like this, like sports or arts, transcends advertising or business. It goes to the germ of our being,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, the company's 36-year-old president and chief executive. With more than 1 billion consumers and only about 7,000 billboards, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is `` a little more naked'' than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> said, meaning that each advertising message has more impact. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to increase its number of billboards to 10,000 within five years, said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Guihong </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for almost all Chinese advertising billboards. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is leading a group of Chinese advertising officials in a nine-day, six-city tour of <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations. Others on the tour include regional officials from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. Outdoor advertising accounts for about 25 percent of advertising expenditures in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, compared to less than 2 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Media </PERSON> said. One reason is that Chinese characters can be understood by all literate Chinese regardless of the language or dialect they speak. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he approached <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s group last year on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>. He said the contact was a sidelight to the main purpose of his visit, which was to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an emissary for former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who wanted to ascertain whether economic reforms were continuing. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said large-character posters are protected by the Chinese constitution. `` It used to be a political message,'' he said. `` Now the message is an advertising message.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> declined to say how <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> would be paid for its services. He said the matter was still under negotiation. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Media </PERSON> will act as exclusive adviser to the Chinese on all outdoor advertising joint venture operations. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> founded <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Media </PERSON> at age 18 and remains its majority shareholder. The company swelled from a three-market operation into a $ 200 million-a-year giantwhen he engineered the $ 710 million acquisition of the assets of Foster and <PERSON> Kleiser </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday defended its role in the hostile takeover attempt of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> against senators' claims the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary had crossed the line between banking and commerce. `` From an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> viewpoint, not only do we think this to be a Shearson transaction and activity in the normal course of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> as ill-informed, provocative and ill-advised,'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, executive vice president of parent company <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was ill-informed because of the `` continued erroneous assertion that somehow <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, rather than <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, which is simply not true and strikes the management of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a bizarre allegation.'' Beazer is a British materials and construction concern. It led a group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of $ 45 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> on March 3, a deal that has since been sweetened to $ 60 per share, or $ 1.7 billion. The Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> produces construction materials and chemicals and employs 1,300 people in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area and 12,300 nationwide. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said it was unfair to characterize <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> as having taken an equity position in the takeover attempt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolitzer </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, said the firm's role was limited to providing short-term, or `` bridge,'' financing for <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer and giving advice. Such financing is `` typical for investment banks in deals of this kind,'' he said. <PERSON> Wolitzer </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> was contributing equity of its own of $ 23 million in the bidding group, but he said management and control of the group would be held by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> `` has dominated and actively guided every aspect of the planning and execution of the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> takeover attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.'' `` In effect, what we have is a bank acting as a corporate raider,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> has crossed the traditional boundary separating banking from commerce and industry, said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` Shearson is only the first to cross a line that Wall Street believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the future,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> Without naming anyone, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said it was `` odd'' that government officials had `` jumped into the fray without taking care to learn about the proposed acquiring company or to familiarize itself with its management and its track record in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and abroad.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the firm that bears his name, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, `` I am not a corporate raider.'' <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said his firm was `` not the sort of organization that seeks to put people out of work, far from it.'' Commenting on the refusal by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> to try to negotiate a merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It appears to me that you can never know anything about an opposing side until you at least can hear their view.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s offer has been extended until April 15 while courts consider legal challenges by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> that have slowed the takeover bid.

<HEAD>Japanese Trade Deficit Declines From 1987 Level, Widens From March

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus continued to decline from year-earlier levels in March, although it widened from February's surplus, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday The surplus totaled $ 7.458 billion, down from $ 8.050 billion in March 1987, bu up from $ 5.238 billion the previous month. After seasonal adjustment, the surplus came to $ 6.552 billion, up from $ 6.479 billion in the previous month. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> registered a trade surplus of $ 3.4 billion with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from $ 3.77 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials characterized the figures as encouraging because of the year-to-year decline. The continuing shrinkage in the latest report was attributed to the high yen, which has slowed the growth of exports while boosting the yen's purchasing power and the value of imports flowing into the country. Imports surged much faster than exports, rising 35 percent to $ 15.21 billion from $ 11.26 billion a year earlier. Exports grew by a comparatively muted 17.4 percent to $ 22.67 billion from $ 19.31 billion a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted imports in the month dipped 3.9 percent to $ 14.76 billion from $ 15.36 billion in February, while adjusted exports inched down 2.4 percent to $ 21.31 billion from $ 21.84 billion. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 15.8 percent to $ 7.17 billion, while American imports rose 55.8 percent to $ 3.77 billion. Motor vehicle imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soared 112.7 percent from a year earlier to $ 20.01 million. Food imports rose 47.1 percent to $ 805.1 million, while textile imports surged 87.8 percent to $ 78.6 million. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports of passenger vehicles to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose 56 percent to $ 1.29 billion. Overall electrical machinery exports were up 11.4 percent to $ 1.57 billion, although television set exports fell 23 percent to $ 27.38 million.

<HEAD>Irving Posts 84 Percent Profit Jump in 1st-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its first-quarter profit jumped 83 percent as tax benefits combined with strong growth in interest income and other gains more than offset a rise in costs. The company, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its profit rose to $ 52.4 million, or $ 2.71 a share, in the first quarter compared with $ 28.6 million, or $ 1.51 a share, a year earlier. Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the results included $ 12.3 million in tax benefits related to the loan-loss provisions that the company took in 1987 in anticipation of problems in collecting some Third World loans. Net interest income rose 12 percent to $ 146.9 million from $ 131.2 million a year earlier as the difference between what the bank paid in interest to obtain funds and what it received on its money widened in the banking company's favor. In the quarter, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> took a provision for credit losses of $ 19.6 million in 1988 compared with $ 21.8 million in 1987. That left its loan loss allowance at $ 696.5 million, or 4.38 percent of loans, compared with $ 224.8 million, or 1.62 percent of loans, a year earlier. Noninterest income increased 16 percent to $ 119 million from $ 102.6 million a year earlier, including a 24 percent rise in trust income. Securities trading generated revenue of $ 6.3 million in contrast with a loss of $ 2.8 million a year earlier. Noninterest expenses rose 11 percent to $ 179 million, including a 10 percent rise in salary and employee benefits. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said earlier this month that it expects to earn $ 234 million in all of 1988 in contrast to a loss of $ 193.2 million a year earlier. It is trying to convince its shareholders to reject <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.08 billion tender offer of cash and securities for all of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is offering 1.575 shares of its own stock and $ 15 a share in cash for each of the 18.4 million shares of Irving stock that it does n't already own. But <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has argued that its advisers rate the offer as inadequate.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Canadian dollar Monday as traders awaited a meeting of finance ministers and the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 450.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 449 late Friday. The dollar rose despite a report that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus in March was a larger-than-expected $ 7.46 billion, including a $ 3.4 billion surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Traders were already so short on dollars that they were reluctant to sell more in reaction to the news, said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. When the dollar showed resistance to being pushed down, traders went the other direction and bought the currency, Glass said. But in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading the dollar fell from its highs of the day. Foreign exchange traders said speculation that Wednesday's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrial nations would produce statements supporting the dollar inspired dealers to cover their positions and buy dollars West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting is likely to reaffirm last December's agreement on economic-policy cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates There was some speculation in the market that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit for February would dip below $ 10 billion, compared with $ 12.4 billion in January, but average estimates were slightly more than $ 11 billion. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 125.71 yen. It gained more ground in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, closing at 126.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 126.18 yen from 125.68 late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8560 dollars to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.8755 late Friday.

<HEAD>Boeing Plans News Conference on Reports of Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> declined Monday to comment on reports that four major airlines had reported defects in the aerospace company's 747 and 767 widebody jets. The problems reportedly ranged from wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting systems. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial airplane division, deflected questions about the reports, saying the company planned to hold a news conference Tuesday to discuss the matter. The newspaper accounts said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had received complaints of defects from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that All Nippon, a Japanese domestic carrier, disclosed it told <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> of several instances of poor workmanship in 747 and 767 airliners, mostly on newly delivered planes. The problems included a wing flap disintegrating in flight on the first day of service, smoke from a misassembled power unit that caused an emergency landing, and problems in a fire extinguisher system, All Nippon said. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by the newspaper as saying a jetliner `` is a big complicated piece of machinery.'' The complaints were `` isolated instances that should n't happen,'' he said `` We're gon na bust our butt to make sure they do n't happen again.'' <PERSON> Yoshiyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Funatsu </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> that problems with defects had been increasing recently at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. He said that while many had been minor, some had safety ramifications, although none of the defects had caused accidents. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' senior vice president for operations, told the newspaper the company's maintenance crews had found faulty fire-suppression systems in the cargo holds of three 767-200s. The system pipes fire-fighting chemicals to the forward and aft compartments of the cargo hold. `` The pipes were misrouted,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` If you light them off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that after being informed of the problem by American, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> found one faulty system on its production line and <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> found several in their planes. Last week, it was reported that <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Susumu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaji </PERSON> had complained of manufacturing mistakes in a March 30 letter to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON>. Besides the fire extinguisher system, the airline complained about engine temperature sensors being installed in reverse order in a 747, which would cause temperature gauges to register for the wrong engines. In its Saturday editions, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published excerpts from a letter from D.K. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' chief engineer for technical and quality services, to <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> inspectors at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s plant found problems in their jets ranging from missing fasteners to wrong or missing parts. One missing part caused the floor of a jet to bow so much that a main deck cargo power drive unit would not work, the Times said. `` My quality inspectors can only properly inspect a very small proportion of each aircraft,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> wrote. `` They should never ever come across ... missing fasteners, missing parts, cracks, bodged rivets, fasterners fitted the wrong way round. Yet we find instances of some of these on every aircraft.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s planned closing of its <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> auto plant would cost $ 209 million in welfare and unemployment benefits, along with lost taxes, for the first two years after the shutdown, a union-commissioned study concluded Monday. The analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> estimated that the plant's closing would cost federal, state and local governments a total of $ 38,000 for each unemployed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> worker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it plans to end auto production at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> by Sept. 30, resulting in the layoffs of 5,500 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> took over the plant last year as part of its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Of about the two dozen studies that we've done, that's the highest figure we've ever come up with,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON>, MCLR research director, told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 headquarters. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said the study, which was commissioned by the union local, was based on a previous <ORGANIZATION> MCLR </ORGANIZATION> study in 1985 but used more comprehensive welfare and employment figures from the state, <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> counties and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. It estimated that the plant's closing would result in $ 62.4 million in unemployment compensation, $ 54.5 million in lost federal income tax revenue, $ 26 million in lost Social Security tax revenue, $ 21.4 million in welfare expenditures and $ 17 million in lost state sales and excise tax revenue. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has threatened to sue <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, claiming the Detroit-based automaker broke a promise to keep the plant open for five years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they may have been overly optimistic when negotiating with the state for improvements and job training funds, but have repeatedly denied making any such promise. The study indicated that 53.1 percent of the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> workers would still be unemployed two years after the plant's closing. In addition, the study estimated that 9,796 other workers in the state would be dislocated by the shutdown. Most of those jobs would be in companies that supply <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> as well as people in retail, service and other jobs supported by the buying power of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` In an economy like this, the absorbtion rate just is n't there. If jobs are n't there, people are n't going to get re-employed,'' <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said. He said the figures for <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> were higher than those in other communities hit by large plant shutdowns because of several different factors in the southeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> economy and in the status of unionized <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers. Among the differences he cited: _ <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> has an above average unemployment rate which has remained above the national average for several years _ The area is strongly dependent on employment at the plant More than one-third of the area's total jobs would be lost with the shutdown. _ <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers make above average salaries and wages, $ 29,120, and have benefits that many other potential employers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> do not have _ Unionized workers in general have a harder time finding new employment <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said the study also estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers would experience a loss in living standards within the first two years. With welfare and compensation benefits and new employment, the worker's average income in the second year would still decline by 77.5 percent, he said. Local 72 negotiator <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said the union commissioned the study as a public service. `` Some people in the public perceive this as a problem for the workers in the plant and do n't realize it's going to cost them a lot of money also,'' he said. <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said the study would be sent to state and local officials to aid in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Makes Unix Software Easier To Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T on Monday announced changes to make it easier for customers to use computers based on its Unix operating system. The new Open Look feature of Unix software will allow users to manipulate the computer with graphic symbols instead of written commands, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. The changes represent another step toward acceptance of Unix in the business world. Until recently, Unix was seen as mainly for science and engineering. Open Look was designed for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T by <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the burgeoning maker of engineering workstations based in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Sun's design is based on original work, contributions from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and technology licensed from <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which originated many of the ideas for graphic screen symbols, the companies said The Open Look screen somewhat resembles that of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Macintosh. Apple, famed for the ease of use of its computers, has been fighting to protect its turf and recently sued <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over a software copyright issue. Apple spokeswoman <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T announcement. Unix is a base layer of software in a computer that serves as a traffic cop for its internal operations. Open Look is a `` user interface,'' which determines the look and feel of a computer to someone sitting at the keyboard. A wide range of companies endorsed Open Look, including software makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oracle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; computer makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and chip makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will circulate specifications of Open Look for comment starting this summer and will make the available in the year's third Software that is written to use Open Look will be available mainly in 1989 and after.

<HEAD>OPEC Speculation Ignites Oil Price Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil-producing nations will cooperate on limiting their output of crude oil sent energy futures prices soaring Monday to their highest level of the year. On other markets, copper futures fell sharply while precious metals advanced; livestock and meat futures moved higher; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. The contract for May delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil shot up $ 1.01 a 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to $ 17.89, the highest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil futures price since Dec. 11. Prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oil also posted unusually sharp gains on news that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would invite representatives from at least seven independent oil-producting nations to meet with five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers on April 23. `` They're not really calling this an emergency session, but it nonetheless indicates they're more serious about doing something about prices and production than most traders foresaw last week,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, vice president of trading for <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-area distributor. Unleaded gasoline settled 1.95 cents to 2.18 cents higher with May at 50.95 cents a gallon; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.42 cents higher with May at 47.88 cents a gallon. Copper prices fell sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange in mostly technical trading. The contract for April delivery lost 4.60 cents, settling at $ 1.012 a pound. Precious metals advanced in reaction to the sharp rise in oil futures but gains were limited by the dollar's strong performance, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.20 higher with the active June contract at $ 454.70 a troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.4 cents higher with April at $ 6.444 a troy ounce Most livestock and meat futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of higher cash prices, analysts said. Live cattle settled unchanged to .50 cent higher with April at 75.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .75 cent higher with April at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .65 cent higher with April at 46 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent lower to .55 cent higher with May at 55.02 cents a pound. Soybean futures gained as much as 4 \ cents a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on ideas that a late-season dry spell had seriously damaged the Brazilian soybean crop Grain futures were mixed to slightly higher. Trading activity was light ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly reports on foreign crop production and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain supply and demand The reports, issued after the close, estimated the Brazilian crop at 18 million metric tons, down from the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s March estimate of 18.5 million metric tons. In its supply-demand report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 290 million bushels of soybeans would remain in storage on Aug. 31, the end of the current soybean marketing year. That compares with a March estimate of 315 million bushels, and probably will support soybean prices, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also revised its estimate for wheat ending stocks from 1.281 billion bushels to 1.231 billion bushels, but left its estimate for corn ending stocks unchanged at 4.123 million bushels. Wheat settled \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 3.17 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.07 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.67 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 4 \ cents higher with May at $ 6.82 a Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.30 points higher at 271.20.

<HEAD>Grolier Agrees To $448 Million Acquisition By French Publisher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Monday unanimously accepted a $ 448.6 million cash takeover offer from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> media giant <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. Under the definitive merger agreement announced on Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s biggest publisher and the second-largest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, would pay $ 24.25 cash per share for the roughly 95 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION>'s 19.5 million common shares it does not already own. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> also granted <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> the option to acquire about 18.5 percent of its outstanding common stock for $ 24.25 per share under certain conditions. Such `` lockup options'' commonly are used to discourage competing bidders. The definitive agreement marks the second time <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> has sweetened its offer for <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION>. The French company initially offered $ 21 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> on March 13, later sweetening the bid to $ 24 a share after <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> rejected the initial offer as inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION>, which has indicated it chiefly was interested in <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION>'s encyclopedia publishing business, said Friday it had agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Childcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 52 million if its takeover bid succeeded. Childcraft markets educational toys by direct mail. Spokesman <PERSON> Amory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said that agreement would remain in force under the definitive merger proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> is an international publisher of encyclopedias, reference and educational books, juvenile books and furniture, trade publications and yearbooks. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Mystic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labs </ORGANIZATION>, a mail-order film processor. The company has about 7,200 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit of $ 22.1 million on revenue of $ 424.2 million in its 1987 fiscal year, up from net income of $ 12.5 million on revenue of $ 350.6 million the previous year. The 162-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION>, which reported sales of more than $ 3 billion in 1987, has operations i book and magazine publishing and distribution, radio broadcasting, movie and television production and outdoor advertising. <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> publishes magazines such as <PERSON> Elle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Match and a new French edition of Fortune, and owns <ORGANIZATION> Curtis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which it describes as the second largest national magazine distributor in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dow Jones & amp; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its first-quarter profit climbed 55.3 percent from a year ago as its revenue rose 37.5 percent and the company reported a huge gain on the sale of a book publishing subsidiary <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Barron's, said its profit amounted to $ 103.6 million, or $ 1.08 a share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with $ 66.7 million, or 69 cents a share, a year ago. First-quarter revenue rose to $ 392.5 million from $ 285.6 million a year earlier. The latest results included an after-tax gain of $ 64.5 million from the previously reported sale of the book publisher <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 135 million. First-quarter results in 1987 included an after-tax gain of $ 29.4 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of the company's 18.9 percent interest in the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Excluding those gains for each period, earnings were up 4.8 percent to $ 39.2 million in the latest quarter compared with $ 37.4 million a year earlier. Operating income for the quarter rose 54.2 percent to $ 91.1 million from $ 59.1 million in 1987. The company said the increase in operating income reflected contributions from <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the electronic financial information service that is 56 percent owned by <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, and the continued growth of Dow Jones' community newspapers. Operating income in the business publications segment fell 22.7 percent to $ 32.6 million as revenue slipped 4.6 percent in the quarter, partly reflecting lower levels of financial advertising in the wake of the October stock market crash. Operating income from the information services segment which includes Telerate results more than fourfold to $ 54.3 million as revenue more than tripled. <ORGANIZATION> Ottaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the community services segment, said its operating income rose 3.7 percent to $ 8.5 million as revenue rose 11.5 percent.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and three of its insurance subsidiaries in deals expected to net it about $ 700 million, the company announced Monday The Greenwich-based company said it signed a definitive agreement to sell <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 410 million in a leveraged buyout to an investor group that included senior members of the business's management. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to sell three of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliated marketing and management companies to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for about $ 235 million, but will incur a one-time loss of about $ 49 million on the sale. <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest specialty retailer of prerecorded music and video home entertainment products. The sales of the insurance businesses and <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> are part of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced strategy of simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> chairman, chief executive officer and president, said the proceeds from the sales would be used to reduce debt. During the past four months, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> stated, it has completed or announced transactions that together are anticipated to result in gross proceeds to the company of about $ 860 million. `` We will continue to focus on the sale of other non-strategic assets,'' <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to complete the <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> sale in the second quarter of 1988. A one-time, after-tax gain of $ 130 million was anticipated as a result of the leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> by an investor group headed by <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lufkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION>'s senior management, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to participate in the leveraged buyout by purchasing up to 20 percent of the company's common stock for $ 10 million and $ 8 million worth of preferred stock. The transaction is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. As of Dec. 31, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION> operated 616 stores in 47 states under the names <ORGANIZATION> Musicland </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goody </PERSON> and Discount Records. Its 1987 revenue was $ 510.5 million. In the insurance deal, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> will buy <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and affiliated companies for the businesses' book value on the closing date plus additional consideration of up to $ 4.8 million. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the book value of the businesses, computed before dividends and other actions that may be taken as part of the transaction, is about $ 235 million. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to incur a one-time, after-tax loss of about $ 49 million on the transaction, principally due to the difference between the tax and book bases of the companies resulting from their tax-free acquisition in 1983. The sale of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Life is subject to the approval of the boards of <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, as well as regulatory approvals. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> acquired the businesses to be sold to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Penncorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in January 1983.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Adopts Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bitterly fought off one hostile takeover bid two years ago and could become a target again, adopted a takeover defense plan on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said the preferred share purchase rights plan was intended to protect shareholders `` in the event of partial tender offers, squeeze-outs, and other abusive tactics to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> without paying all stockholders a premium.'' The plan would make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> common shareholders to acquire a new issue of preferred stock in the event a party acquired 20 percent of the company's common shares or launched a tender offer to acquire 20 percent or more. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's third-largest bank holding company, following No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A.W. <PERSON> Clausen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the plan was not in reaction to any specific buyout proposal. He noted that hundreds of other companies had adopted similar plans. <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> stock closed down 12 -LCB- cents to $ 11 a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, waged a lengthy and bitter hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> beginning in 1986, but gave up its chase last year in the face of a major <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> restructuring that the suitor said diminished the value of its target. `` I do n't know why they took this action at this point, except that maybe the time to do it is when you do n't need to,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> `` Maybe they just want to be prepared.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> added, if the company did not have further major problems with its troubled Third World debt portfolio it might be able to produce a string of profitable performances that could make it an attractive target. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> announced the formation of three regional capital markets operations to serve <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Each will be responsible for trading, merchant banking and investment banking activities in its respective region. `` We're reorganizing our operation from product-oriented to geography-oriented,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>.

In a news release, the companies cited difficulties in structuring and completing the definitive agreements for the transaction as reasons for ending the talks. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> said it intended to continue operating building the Family Products business, which is a major maker of tampons and also produces toothbrushes, household gloves and disposable baby nursers. `` The business had a highly successful year in 1987 and is off to a strong start in 1988,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON>, chairman and CEO of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, said in the release. On Feb. 16, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said it had agreed to pay $ 726 million for <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>. Industry analysts said at the time that the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> would give the health care giant more than 30 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tampon market, of which it already has about 6 percent with the O.B. brand tampon. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> is one of three operating subsidiaries of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, itself once part of <ORGANIZATION> BCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company formed by the April 1986 leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos </ORGANIZATION>. The Family Products Division accounts for half <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and 70 percent of its profits, <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION>'s other two divisions are <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jhirmack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of hair care products, and <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION>, a leading worldwide manufacturer of bras, girdles and pantyhose. Proceeds from the sale of the Family Products Division would have gone towards paying off debt incurred in the December 1986 leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> from BCI, <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> said when the proposed deal was announced. <PERSON> Smilow </PERSON> said in the release Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Playtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> would continue its efforts to sell the Jhirmack division.

<HEAD>Steelmaker Allowed To Sell Most Of Idled Monessen Mill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can sell most of its idled mill in <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled Monday. The $ 18.1 million deal, approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, is unusual because both companies are reorganizing under federal bankruptcy laws. The deal does not include a $ 120 million rail mill that is to be sold in three months by the federal agency that financed and later foreclosed on it. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s offer, which edged out four other bids, was for <LOCATION> Monessen </LOCATION>'s coke ovens, raw steelmaking facilities and continuous bloom caster, a piece of equipment that produces semi-finished products. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has until May 15 to complete the purchase, but has reserved the right to back out of the deal if the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and Judge <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> refuse to grant temporary relief from pollution control standards imposed on coke operations at the <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> mill. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors said <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was best, partly because the steelmaker would provide a ready market for the coke. They also said <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> would be better able to press any financial claims against another company that was reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law than against one that was not. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said his company's plans to reopen the coke ovens will bring back about 150 jobs. The ovens were idled in June 1986 but kept partially fired to prevent their brick linings from deteriorating. A restart of the operations also would enable <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> to recall about 90 to 100 of its own workers who were laid off last week when a shortfall of coke _ a necessary ingredient in steelmaking _ caused the company to temporarily idle one of its two blast furnaces. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> purchases coke on the open market, but has been unable to fill its requirements.
