<TEXT>
 The `` Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks whose murder convictions have drawn protest at home and abroad, are scheduled to be hanged Friday, one of their lawyers said Monday. Attorney <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> said an appeal for clemency was denied and the five men and one woman were notified they will be executed Friday morning. The six were convicted in connection with the killing of black township councilor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, on Sept. 3, 1984. Evidence at their trial showed the six were not among those who actually hacked and burned <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> to death. They were convicted under the doctrine of `` common purpose,'' which holds they were responsible for the killing by being part of the mob that gathered outside <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s home with the intent to kill him. Human rights groups and government officials, both in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and internationally, have called for clemency. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, 26, is the only woman on death row in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for what activists consider a politically motivated offense. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government expressed hope Monday night that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will call off the hangings. <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalker </PERSON>, minister of state at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, `` Even at this late stage we sincerely and earnestly hope that the South African government will heed the united call of everyone for clemency in these cases.'' She said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> backed a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for the sentences to be commuted. About 100 lawmakers of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signed a statement expressing `` total condemnation'' of the planned executions. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, appealed to South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to spare the lives of the six. <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s killing came during riots which began a two-year outbreak of nationwide anti-apartheid protests that left more than 2,000 blacks dead. Black activists frequently targeted black township councilors, considering them collaborators with the white-led government. The <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> appealed to the government Monday to `` demonstrate good will to the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in particular and mankind at large by sparing the lives of the Sharpeville Six.'' The scheduled execution date is three days before the anniversary of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> riots of March 21, 1960. Sixty-nine blacks were killed when police fired on peaceful protesters demonstrating against the pass laws, which required blacks to carry identification documents while in white areas. The laws have since been repealed. The 1960 shootings raised an international storm of protest. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared Monday `` it's not over'' for his Republican presidential campaign despite indications of a big <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> victory for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> admitted `` I have no plans beyond tomorrow'' and the home-state primary he needs to win. With five presidential candidates racing around the state in a final day of campaigning, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was buoyed by a poll suggesting he may have pulled even with fellow favorite son <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` On the eve of a significant breakthrough ... with your help, we the people can win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 1,800 in <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I tell you, we the people will win.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, lying third, sought a good enough showing to keep up some momentum from Super Tuesday. Over and over on Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hammered at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s contention that the Democratic convention will be deadlocked. It `` would be a disaster'' for the Democrats to end the primary process without a nominee-to-be, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, with `` negotiating, dealing, people behind closed doors trying to decide who the nominee ought to be.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> apparently was n't the only Democrat wanting to avoid a brokered convention. Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> suggested Monday he would try to rally uncommitted delegates behind whichever candidate is leading the field at the end of the primary season, if none has a lock on the nomination. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he did n't want to `` leave the impression that <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>'s going to be the broker'' but said he would be `` in the middle'' of efforts to avoid hurting the nominee with a battle just before or during the convention The problem for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was much more immediate than the conventions, months away in the summer. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> was looking for a way to keep his campaign alive in the face of a string of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victories. `` It's not over for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' he told the Executives Club of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Later, at a news conference, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> repeated his determination to continue beyond Tuesday: `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going.'' The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said he had `` made some inroads'' against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but that there had not been enough time to stop <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surge after a 16-state win last Tuesday. `` You want to elect momentum or elect the better candidate?'' he asked the Executives Club audience. `` Maybe it's going to take a couple of weeks for everything to sort of slow down.'' But the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> outlook for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was not good. A <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the choice of 62 percent of the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with only 28 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Such a strong showing could give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a big chunk of the 82 Republican delegates at stake in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Added to his current total of 705 delegates, it could give him more than 60 percent of the 1,139 needed to win the nomination at the GOP National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has 165. Despite the numbers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a reporter that suggestions he has locked up the nomination are premature. `` I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he flew on Air Force Two from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, Ill. However, when asked if he were surprised that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was staying in the race, he replied: `` I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.'' On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was facing the reality that he has to win the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary to keep even his stripped-down campaign alive until the Democratic National Convention in July. `` I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' he said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I have to win and I will win. But obviously <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> come next.'' And second place is n't good enough. `` A strong second is n't very strong,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a reporter. If he does end up in second place in either delegates or the popular vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he said, `` I'd have to reevaluate.'' One poll published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> suggested <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> faces the possibility of a second-place finish. The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, said 32 percent of likely Democratic voters supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 29 percent backed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and 20 percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had the backing of 4 percent. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed 500 people and had a potential margin of error of 5 percentage points. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> tracking poll published in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the lead with 39 percent support to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 34 percent among very likely Democratic voters <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 17 percent with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> far behind. The potential sampling error in the survey, conducted Saturday and Sunday, was plus or minus 6 percentage points. Going into the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held the lead in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, with 463 to 424 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 353 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> just 36. A total of 173 delegates are at stake on the Democratic side in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. One <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> goal is to win some of those delegates, a difficult task given the complicated nature of the state's ballot. Voters not only cast ballots for presidential candidates, they also vote directly for delegate candidates. Thus, a vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the `` beauty contest'' portion does not necessarily mean a vote for him in the delegate selection process. Another goal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said privately, is to narrow the Democratic field. Mentioning the polls showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drawing his last-minute support from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s voters, the governor's aides said they would be delighted to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, believing it would drive the senator from the race. Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was to be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on primary day, where he planned to meet with the visiting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> campaign characterized it as a meeting of `` two old friends.''

 <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, whose outspoken suppport of women's reproductive rights is a family tradition, made a rare public appearance Monday night when Planned Parenthood honored her and her late mother at a gala affair. The 79-year-old Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> received a standing ovation from 1,100 guests at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the black-tie event, titled `` Celebrating Two Generations of Individual Courage. `` It's a frightfully important subject,'' the actress said of women's rights to abortion and birth control. `` And I'm damn lucky to have had a mother who waked me up at an early age'' to the importance of `` doing things for other people.'' Attired in a black pantsuit, Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> said, `` ` When a girl becomes pregnant should she be forced by law to have this baby? She's 13. She does n't want it. She ca n't support it. Her family does n't want it. It would seem to me that she should be allowed to have an abortion.'' Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> was `` enthusiastic'' about the party, said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` She felt her mother deserved the honoring,'' he said. The black-tie event is to benefit a Planned Parenthood fund to honor Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>. Proceeds from the dinner, priced at $ 500 to $ 1,000 a ticket, will be dedicated to Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>'s three priorities: keeping abortion safe and legal, preventing teen-age pregnancies and preserving family planning for the poor. Her mother, an early supporter of birth control, worked alongside Planned Parenthood founder <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> more than 70 years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, a member of the <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> family that founded Corning Glass, testified before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s on the need for birth control, particularly for poor women, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said. She maintained that `` a rich woman could get the information and access to birth control but the poor woman could not,'' he said. She died in 1951 at the age of 73. Miss <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> became involved in Planned Parenthood in 1981. The group's president, <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON>, recruited the actress `` to take on the legacy her mother had established by volunteering to write letters and be spokesperson for reproductive rights and abortion rights for women,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> said. He said her involvement has brought the organization an additonal 200,000 donors and supporters.

 More than 50 handicapped people demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to protest what they said are federal policies that result in inadequate mass transit services for disabled people. Some protestors chained themselves to the doors of the DOT headquarters and vowed to stay until officials agree to improve bus service for handicapped people. Members of Americans Disabled For Accessible Transportation -LRB- ADAPT -RRB- gathered from around the country to protest the department's decision to appeal a January ruling that transit agencies must provide services to the handicapped regardless of cost. In the ruling, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> struck down a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation requiring the nation's transit authorities to spend no more than 3 percent of their budgets on the disabled. The demonstrators timed their protest to coincide with a three-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents local agencies that provide bus and subway service. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney who represented ADAPT in the lawsuit, said the present system of allowing transit agencies to decide what services to provide to the handicapped `` gives individual states the option to discriminate.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, handicapped residents must phone five to seven days in advance to get an accessible bus to pick them up. `` They should be able to use the next bus coming along,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` Many transit authorities simply do n't want funny-looking people on the bus with normal people.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Monday the department is `` fully committed to providing mass transportation to people with disabilities.''

 The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, still one of the hemisphere's most important pieces of real estate, has allowed ships to move between the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> without interruption through nine months of political unrest. Nearly 13,000 vessels a year avoid the long voyage around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, by traveling 50 miles from sea to sea through the `` Big Ditch'' that opened in 1914. More than 140 million tons of cargo move through it every year. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties signed in 1977 commit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to turn over complete control of the canal and military installations to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by midnight Dec. 31, 1999. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the man in charge in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, claims <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to renege on the treaties and continue `` occupying'' the canal indefinitely. He says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is waging a smear campaign to try to replace him with an administration it can manipulate. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last month on charges of involvement in smuggling Colombian cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Although the canal remains an emotional topic of debate, its strategic importance has declined in the past 30 years. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, says that is because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has improved and extended its military forces. `` During and after World War II, through the 1950s, the major port system was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and sealift through the canal was about the only way to reinforce presence in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, but now there are major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces in both oceans and major ports on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There is less of a need to transport capital ships through the canal, and airlift capacity has increased tremendously.'' Traffic through the canal brings the commission about $ 320 million a year in tolls. Supertankers and the largest bulk carriers are too big for the three sets of locks that raise and lower vessels 85 feet, but 93 percent of the world's ships can get through, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainio </PERSON>, chief of the commission's Economic and Marketing Division. `` The Panamax is still the world's most popular cargo shipbuilding design,'' he said, referring to the largest vessel the canal can handle. A Panamax vessel has a beam width of 106 feet. The locks are 110 feet wide. Nor is the canal concept outdated. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> began a study last year of the feasibility of building another. Its conclusions are expected in 1992 at the earliest. For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the strategic value of what used to be the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone is enhanced by the presence of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, involving about 10,000 American soldiers and 20,000 dependents, which is responsible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It operates half a dozen bases along the canal and has its headquarters in <LOCATION> Quarry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, adjacent to <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>. During their long tenure, the Americans built replicas of their own towns. Communities of white wooden houses on tree-lined streets named in English still can be found in the 10-mile-wide area that had been the Canal Zone. <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> said this week that day-to-day coordination between his commission and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> port authorities is `` easy, fluid and very effective.'' This month, there had been several bomb threats, which he called `` an irritant,'' and the commision flew in large quantities of cash because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banking crisis to cover the paychecks of canal employees. The latest checks were handed out Monday. Under sanctions imposed last week, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is withholding monthly payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> of about $ 6.6 million for canal operations and putting the money in escrow.

<TEXT>
 Fifty years after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> closed the world's first museum of Jewish art in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, a private exhibit of Jewish ritual objects has been drawing large crowds of visitors. Some 800 items displayed at the `` Judentum in <LOCATION> Wien </LOCATION>'' -LRB- `` Jews in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'' -RRB- exhibit housed by the Museum of the History of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> are all loans from a private Judaica collection, regarded by art historians as one the most important private collections of Jewish life. According to <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, owner of the collection, most of the drawings, paintings, sculptures, medals, coins, manuscripts and handicraft on show were in danger of being destroyed or lost after <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s annexation by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1938. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a Viennese businessman who survived a Nazi concentration camp, pieced together his collection over years and this is the first time it has been shown in public. The exhibit displays mementoes of Jewish life from the early 18th century until present, focusing on <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> as an important center in the history of European Jewry. Museum officials said it is the first step toward opening a permanent Jewish museum here in the next two or three years. About 6,000 Jews live in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> today, compared with 200,000 who helped make this city a capital of science, culture and the arts before World War II. They included <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Freud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> and hundreds of others. Some 65,000 Austrian Jews perished in Nazi concentration and death camps during the war. The exhibit is divided into eight sections, including ritual objects and Hebrew writings, the Jewish year and life, the history of the Viennese Jews, Zionism, anti-semitism and persecution and Jewish contributions to art and culture. `` It's the first time that the most important private <ORGANIZATION> Judaica </ORGANIZATION> collection in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is displayed for the Austrian public after the war,'' <PERSON> Karl-Albrecht </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, a curator who helped set up the display, said in an interview. By March 3, the exhibit had been visited by some 30,000 people. `` On Saturdays and Sundays we have up to 500 visitors a day,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said, adding that recently Austrian school authorities advised schools to come and see the exhibit as part of their history classes. More young Austrians gradually have been educated about the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past and the Holocaust in the two years since the first disclosures that President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had covered up his wartime past as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said the exhibit was planned before <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> became president. The most valuable objects displayed are a silver-and-gold torah crown made in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1810 and a torah plaque made in 1806 of gold-covered silver. The oldest display is a torah curtain made around 1700 of red velvet laced with silver threads. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said the first Jewish Museum in the world opened in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1895, with a very big collection of Jewish art. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> dismantled it in 1938. While some items were lost or destroyed, others were taken by the Germans to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> where they planned to open a big anti-semitic Jewish museum. The museum never materialized but some objects have remained in the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Jewish Museum which opened after the war. Asked if the Austrians ever asked the Czechs to return the items held by the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said they never did. `` It's difficult to prove what objects belonged to the Jewish <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> as all catalog were destroyed during the war,'' he said.

 A cracked fuel line threw a metric wrench into a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> to become the first Japanese automaker to transport its U.S.-built cars back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for sale.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> shrugged off new poll results suggesting his lead in his home state had diminished to a tie with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but conceded Sunday that his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign was hampered by not having the money to buy television ads in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` Obviously, not to have paid media hampers me in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said as he campaigned in the city's <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` But the only way I could have paid media would be to use up the resources and obligate the matching funds that are coming.'' That would have left <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> unable to afford television advertising in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other states with contests upcoming, he said. `` Frankly, I'm not in it just for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ otherwise I'd go on paid media. ... I want to win the nomination _ not buy the nomination,'' he added. But the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll to be published in Monday's editions suggested <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign was faltering in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, despite his record as a state representative and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. The poll of 500 registered Democrats indicated 32 percent supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 29 percent backed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and 20 percent favored <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. However, the poll, taken for the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points, making the race a dead heat. The poll, taken Friday and Saturday, updates one taken earlier last week that showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> leading with 35 percent, followed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 30 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 18 percent. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> still insisted he would carry his home state on Tuesday, saying, `` I think the people of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are going to make a sound decision.'' And his optimism appeared to be supported by a poll for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> which was published in Monday's editions of the newspaper That poll showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> holding a strong lead with 42 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 33 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 14 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> 4 percent, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> 3 percent and others and undecided, 4 percent. The poll was based on telephone interviews Friday night and Saturday with 287 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters who were likely to cast ballots. The margin of error was 6 percent. `` I would add that four years ago there was n't a single poll that showed me ahead and I won,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, referring to his upset victory in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Percy </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has assaulted <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s campaign with a blitz of last-minute television advertising, accused <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of `` doing a disservice to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' by talking up the likelihood of a brokered presidential convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I think the notion of a brokered convention would be an absolute disaster,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Sunday. `` The reality is we're not going to have a first-ballot nominee,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> countered. `` And those brokered conventions have produced candidates ... like <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and it turned out quite well for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.''

 It's been nearly three years since a toddler's visit to a doctor sparked what has become the marathon trial of <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, a former day-care teacher accused of sexually abusing her students. Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, 26, resigned from the Wee Care Day Nursery in <LOCATION> Maplewood </LOCATION> in April 1985 after working for six months. A few days later, a boy, now 7, told a nurse taking his temperature rectally that Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> did the same to him. The school was closed soon afterward, and by December 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> had been indicted on 235 counts of sexually abusing 31 3-to 5-year-old students. The charges have since been reduced to 20 students. Closing arguments in the trial, which began nine months ago in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, are expected to begin Tuesday. The prosecution contends Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> performed sexual acts on the children, forced them to perform sexual acts on her, engaged them in nude sex play and threatened further harm if they told of the abuse. Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, who once aspired to be an actress, has been free on $ 25,000 bail and living with her family in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> since January 1986. All but 128 charges of abuse have been dropped because of lack of evidence and recent higher court rulings that clarified what testimony is admissible in child sex abuse cases. `` We'll all be glad when it's over,'' Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON>, said last week. `` We are very, very optimistic she'll be acquitted on all charges.'' Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said, `` We feel there is no reason to disbelieve the children's testimony about what happened.'' The boy who went to the doctor three years ago testified via closed-circuit television last June that Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> once took his temperature and that of two friends using a rectal thermometer. The boy's mother testified earlier he told her in April 1985 that Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> used a rectal thermometer daily on children. The mother and son were among about 120 prosecution witnesses. In all, 19 children testified via closed-circuit television from Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harth </PERSON>'s chambers. Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> took the stand earlier this month, and was one of 22 defense witnesses. The defense has argued there was not `` the time, space or opportunity'' in the bustling environment of the school for Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> to commit the alleged offenses. But the prosecution said Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>, whose duties included supervising napping children, created opportunities. They contend she sometimes took children, without permission, to a remote music room and played the piano during sex games. The defense also says the children were prompted in their allegations by investigators, psychologists and prosecutors. Experts for the prosecution testified children can not be `` brainwashed'' and could not have made up the stories. The prosecution also said Ms. <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON>' presented a false image of herself. `` As a four-year drama student, a lot of what she was doing on the witness stand was an attempt to appear spontaneous when in fact it was not spontaneous,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Metzler </PERSON> said: `` What we have is a very, very large jigsaw puzzle that the jury must complete. ... We are going to show there are pieces missing from the puzzle. Then it's up to the jury to determine if the missing pieces amount to a reasonable doubt.''

 Amid the glitter and glamour of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a parade of other celebrities, a gala benefit Sunday raised $ 2 million for AIDS, which organizers said made it the largest private fund-raiser for the disease ever. `` That's so much money ... I mean that's so incredibly much money, and the things that money will do!'' said Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` We're talking about living or dying. And it's getting closer and closer to all of us. ... We want to do something about it. `` The government can help to a certain point. Dollars can help to a certain point,'' she said. The evening's total was about $ 2 million, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Figetakis </PERSON>, an associate of Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s publicist, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> chairs the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which will receive part of the funds. She served as hostess and chief drawing card at the gala. As the finale swung into full force Sunday night, a steady stream of stars in sparkling jewels and dresses began arriving at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel here. They expressed gratitude they could contribute in the battle against AIDS. `` It's really an honor for me to be here,'' actor <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. `` It's a real problem everywhere, not just in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but all over the world. Anything I can do to help is why I'm here.'' `` I think it's about time <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> got involved in the fight against AIDS,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice star <PERSON> Saundra </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>. `` I'm very happy to be here to support this. Other stars on hand included <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiegs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margaux </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Organizers say they hope the benefit will serve as a model for similar fund-raising efforts elsewhere. `` We've had the most private funds raised -LRB- for acquired immune deficiency syndrome -RRB- at this one function than any other place in the country,'' said event spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cinnamon </PERSON>. `` We want it to be the prototype for the rest of the country.'' Despite a lack of corporate sponsorships, which had been expected to raise some $ 500,000 of the initial $ 3 million goal, tickets to the `` grand finale'' at the hotel here sold out and private donations were giving the fund drive an added boost, organizers said. Stars and guests were invited Sunday to attend about a dozen black-tie parties from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, being held at the homes of local celebrities and prominent community leaders for $ 2,500 a plate, before converging in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> for the finale. The AIDS benefit was spearheaded by the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION>, a fund-raising arm of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Proceeds from the event were being split between the university's AIDS programs and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group chaired by Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, which supports research and education. In <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> raised at least $ 137,000 in advance ticket sales for a private party being held in her home with Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and some 300 guests. During the event, Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, a former child star and widow of a wealthy industrialist, announced she was giving an additional $ 1.1 million, <PERSON> Figetakis </PERSON> said. Funds raised in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> will go toward the Comprehensive AIDS Program, an organization in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glade </LOCATION> that cares for AIDS victims. Other private dinner parties were being held in the homes of singer <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>, theatrical producer <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Bufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Centrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, among others.

 With Super Tuesday behind them, the presidential candidates are looking toward the next big Tuesday on the calendar _ June 7, when the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> primaries offer the last big bloc of delegates to be allocated before the national conventions. There are other big primaries in coming months, including <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But none offers a larger one-day delegate total than Final Tuesday, as it's been dubbed. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also will hold primaries June 7. For Democrats, with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> bunched in the lead, the late primaries on opposite sides of the country now loom as potentially decisive. On the Republican side, where a big Super Tuesday victory last week made Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his party's likely choice, the June 7 primaries are expected to be much less crucial. A day after Super Tuesday, both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> announced they would soon make campaign stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, is building organizations in both states. <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> says the Super Tuesday result `` almost guarantees that the race will come down to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will have a say in picking the nominee.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> takes on real importance. We are, with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the final two tests.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters will select 205 Democratic delegates in the primary, and 109 more will be chosen in post-primary meetings. Along with 22 pre-selected `` super delegates,'' the state will send the largest single delegation to the convention with 336 members. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Democrats will select 71 delegates in primary voting. They'll join with 38 more picked by party leaders, and nine super delegates for a total of 118. To win the nomination, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate will need 2,082 delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now leads the field with 460, followed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 424 and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 353. Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> totals 145 delegates, followed by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 36. Some party leaders say it will be nearly impossible for any of the three leaders to gather enough wins between now and June to win the nomination on the convention's first ballot. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner, would need to win more than 60 percent of the delegates remaining available. But Final Tuesday wins could give any candidate an unchallengable advantage in the final stretch. `` If you can go into the convention just coming off of -LRB- a win in -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, it's momentum,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> independent pollster <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON> said results from the two primaries also have the potential to sway several hundred uncommitted super delegates from around the nation.

 Red lights do n't stop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president's limousine glides along under state police escort, with cars pulling over to make way. Traffic signals are ignored; the curious crane their necks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is hoping Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary will be just as smooth a ride. Although heavily favored to win the state's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> contest, with 82 delegates at stake, the vice president nonetheless has been spending 12-hour days on the campaign trail. But on the stump his targets are no longer Republican rivals like <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator he crushed in the primaries of Super Tuesday. Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is aiming his rhetoric at Democrats. `` I've never seen such a gloomy bunch,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Democrats, as he spoke to 500 people at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dinner here. `` Everything they said about our country is negative _ midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by contrast, is upbeat. He ought to be _ he's so far ahead of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> has quit polling on the Republican side. At a stop in a campaign office in <LOCATION> Libertyville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who has been accompanying him around the state, made phone calls to try to round up votes. `` We're putting the hard sell on,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said into the telephone. `` We're at the grass-roots stage now.'' At stop after stop, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivers his message _ along with a series of one-liners. He said his success on Super Tuesday `` gave new meaning to the words Southern Comfort.'' He tells crowds he's got the support of the `` <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>'' _ <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>. His standard speech includes pledges to trim the deficit in four years through tight spending, and to be tough with the Soviets. He says he expects criticism from the Democrats over the Iran-Contra affair _ he got some Sunday, from <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had never fully explained his role in the matter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says he has answered all questions about the matter except his private advice to the president on secret arms sales, said he was n't worried about Democrats harping on Iran-Contra. `` They'll raise it,'' he said. `` Of course they will. So what?'' The Democrats, he said, lack knowledge of foreign affairs. `` I ca n't wait to debate any one of those Democrats on foreign policy. None of them have had any experience except when they had breakfast at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pancakes </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. He touches on the matter indirectly, perhaps, when he warns voters to expect to find a few warts. `` I might make a mistake here and there,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` but I've had enough experience I would n't do it like <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON> did They asked <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> what went wrong when the <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> lost a few ball games. He said ` We made the wrong mistakes.''' `` You've got to think about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Anybody's going to make mistakes.'' In the bleachers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieda </PERSON>, 30, held his 1 -LCB- - year-old daughter and nodded in agreement `` I like what I hear,'' he said. `` Those are the issues that are important to me: bargaining from strength and tackling the deficit. But you can say anything now. The proof is in the pudding. We'll see what happens if he gets in.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mass resignation of Arab policemen has displayed the muscle of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and posed a security dilemma for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians alike in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A national police spokesman, <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldapfel </PERSON>, on Sunday said that 450 of the 850 Arab police in the occupied territories `` have asked to leave the force.'' He left open the possibility more would depart. The police control crime and direct traffic, but they are not used to quell <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioting in the occupied lands, now in its fourth month. Arab officers in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said all 70 Arab policemen would be off the job today at the city's headquarters office for the southern half of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. As a shift ended at noon Sunday, newly retired officers drifted from the station in jeans and jackets into the central Manger Square. A dozen <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in riot gear stood watch beside a phalanx of huge tour buses. `` I will be left without a job, without income,'' said traffic officer <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghayada </PERSON>, who spent 12 of his 36 years on the force. He said he might try driving a taxi. `` The people have decided, and we go with the decision of the Palestinian people,'' said policeman <PERSON> Fadl </PERSON> <PERSON> Najajri </PERSON>, a 15-year veteran and a father of nine. The walkout was triggered by a communique issued March 10 by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and clandestine local leaders of the violent protests against Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The message was driven home for some officers by the March 8 stabbing death of a Palestinian policeman in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> accused of cooperating too closely with Israeli authorities. `` The killing in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> made me decide very quickly,'' said a 33-year-old policeman who gave his name only as <PERSON> Ramis </PERSON>. The National Police Commissioner, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio on Sunday: `` There's pressure on them from the outside and a system of threats. But each one of them is organizing his friends, and we'll deal with them.'' He did not specify how. The resignations threaten to open wider cracks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s territorial administration, which employs 18,000 Arabs and is an important buffer between Israelis and the already rebellious Palestinians `` It is a precedent for many more civil servants to resign,'' said <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>. Forty tax collectors in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> quit last week under pressure from underground organizers. Rioters in the village of <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION> on Feb. 24 lynched an alleged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> collaborator who opened fire on a crowd nearing his house and killed a child. Authorities punished Qatabiyeh by banning visits of family members from abroad and forbidding the town's major export of stone to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Authorities also demolished houses of people accused of involvement in attacks on alleged collaborators. `` Such methods will be used against villages and groups we know are involved in attacks on people who are considered to be collaborators or people who are cooperating with authorities,'' said a senior military spokesman. But he also admitted on Sunday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` can not provide 100 percent security'' to all people who work with authorities. Police spokesman <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> on Sunday termed the police resignations `` a big problem,'' and said authorities discussed offering pay raises to keep veteran officers. Several Arab officers said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> superiors had offered to double their pay, now $ 400 to $ 500 a month, if they would stay. All said they refused. Arab businessmen also are worried by the disappearance of local protectors. `` The authorities will not bring any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police to this area. There will be no law here,'' said <PERSON> Rabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON>, owner of a plastics factory and a gasoline station in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> spokesman in the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> head office said police in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, were unable to respond to a major traffic accident on Sunday. `` I feel abandoned when out of 80 people at the station, only six of us were left,'' the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> district commander, <PERSON> Miko </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachar </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. He said all six were Israeli officers. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> also said the resignations `` will vastly affect the process of the courts in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' which together with those in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> handle about 200,000 cases a year, mostly traffic-related.

<HEAD>Giant Overseas Building Company Caught up in Pipeline Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a giant construction company which for years quietly built billion-dollar projects in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, is receiving unwanted attention from a grand jury investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s role in a failed <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> pipeline deal. The aborted deal, to build a pipeline from Iraqi oilfields to the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>, was part of what <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Alden </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> called a `` project development scheme'' to boost business in a bad market. Falling oil prices were devastating the international construction business in 1984 when <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> began to draw up engineering and financing plans for the $ 1 billion pipeline. `` It did n't work for geopolitical reasons,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is focusing on a possible bribery conspiracy involving <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> businessman involved with <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> in the deal, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> hired by <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> to garner administration backing for the project. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who was president of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> before joining the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1982, recused himself from any role in the pipeline negotiations, opening the way for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to become the pivotal Cabinet official in the deal. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel under <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, appears to have played no role in the deal In addition to the unwelcome publicity over the pipeline deal, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> continues to have problems of a different nature, the same ones that drove it into the politically risky <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> pipeline deal. Lower oil prices, the dearth of nuclear projects and debt in the developing world have curtailed <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s trademark leviathan deals. `` People characterize us as not willing to take on little projects, but that's not true any more,'' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s business jumped from $ 7.6 billion in 1980 to an average of $ 13 billion annually 1981-83, and back down to $ 8.6 billion in 1984. It has fallen more gradually since then, forcing the company to seek new markets. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s `` mega projects,'' those costing above $ 50 million, have dropped from 96 in 1983 to 73 in 1986. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> declined to discuss the specifics of the pipeline case because it is under investigation, but he said it fit into a larger pattern under which <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> officials sought to spot potential jobs, prepare engineering reports and arrange financing for prospective clients. Along these lines, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 has been studying the possibility of building a second <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. `` The Iraq-Jordan pipeline was a ` project development scheme,''' said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. `` In the old days, an oil company would send out a request for a project, and we would do it. Now we doing project development, looking at the stuff way upstream.'' In the pipeline deal, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> sought out a partner in <LOCATION> Rappaport </LOCATION>, who owns oil refineries and tankers, and asked him to secure promises from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials that they would not attack the pipeline, said company spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Donner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, hired by <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, wrote a memo to <LOCATION> Meese </LOCATION> on Sept. 25, 1985, saying that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> had confirmed an arrangement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s then-prime minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will receive somewhere between $ 65 - $ 70 million a year for 10 years out of the conclusion of the project `` What is also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor,'' wrote <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, in an apparent reference to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' Labor Party. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his lawyers deny that the wording referred to a bribe _ the allegation the special prosecutor is investigating. Iraqi officials informed <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> in a letter dated Dec. 31, 1985, that they were dissatisfied with security arrangements and that the deal was off, said <PERSON> Donner </PERSON>. Other deals have gone bad for <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>. New orders fell from $ 13 billion in 1980 to $ 3.5 billion in 1986, the most recent year for which full statistics are available. And the payroll is down from a high of 45,000 to fewer than 18,000, according to company officials. They declined to provide profit figures. The company still prefers massive projects, but has expanded into such new areas as computerized factories, space and weapons technology and toxic waste cleanup, said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. `` If you can do a $ 1 billion job, it is easier than doing ten $ 100 million jobs,'' he said in a succinct statement of the Bechtel credo. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> still pulls down its share of big jobs worldwide. Its engineers are involved in the $ 9.6 billion project to build the Eurotunnel under the English channel. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> also is building a $ 3.3 billion tunnel project in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and a $ 2.7 billion project to develop a new central terminal at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 Nine-year-old <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> has big brown eyes and long brown hair. She also has no mother, no father, no little brother and almost no hope. `` All in all, she's been one of the lucky ones,'' says <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Septimus </PERSON>, head of social services at the <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the nation's largest pediatric AIDS clinic. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> is among a growing number of children who are victims of congenital AIDS. They must pay with their future for a parent's past _ a problem that becomes more common as the disease enters the heterosexual population Both of <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>'s parents were intravenous drug users who contracted AIDS; her mother died in 1983, her father died last year. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and her brother were infected in the uterus. He died Christmas Eve. Every two weeks, to assist and extend her fragile life, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> is given treatments of gamma globulin, blood serum that contains a high concentration of antibodies. She is the oldest youngster of more than a dozen treated there. Some, less than a year old, are born to die; others face years of battling the disease and the cruel ostracism that often surrounds it. In either case, the prognosis for such children remains invariably pessimistic, specialists say. `` We have never seen anybody who has beaten the disease,'' <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said recently. `` I think you get to a certain point and hope you can stay there, not deteriorate further.'' Recent state Health Department figures indicate the potential number of AIDS-infected newborns is growing at a startling rate. One in every 61 babies born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last November carried antibodies to the AIDS virus, which means they had been exposed to the virus. About 40 percent of these children will develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome in some form; 25 percent to 30 percent of those children will be dead before their second birthday. Most of them were born to mothers who used drugs intravenously. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the city health commissioner, put the number of children born in the city with AIDS antibodies last year at about 600; for 1988 the projection is 1,000. Between 1980 and 1986, the total was only about 250 children. In fact, AIDS babies were cited as the reason for the first increase in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s infant mortality rate since 1974. One reason for the spurt is the large number of addicts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Intravenous drug abusers make up almost half the city's AIDS population while in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and most other cities with large AIDS populations, most sufferers are homosexual But even in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a state not known for large outbreaks of AIDS, one in 476 child-bearing women tested positive for AIDS antibodies, according to a study reported recently in the New England Journal of Medicine. Nationwide, there were 865 cases of pediatric AIDS reported as of Feb. 29, with 111 diagnosed in just the first two months of the year. Altogether, 518 children are known to have died of AIDS. The Bronx Municipal Hospital Day Care Center, the nation's first day care facility for AIDS-infected children, opened in June 1986 to help out; <PERSON> Septimus </PERSON> said another is planned for <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>. Sixty-five percent of the <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> kids live in foster homes, she said. But some have spent so much time in hospitals, in broken homes or at arm's length from a terrified society that social skills like speaking have not been properly developed. In fact, they say the children remain innocent victims to the end, never realizing they were born without much of a chance. `` Some of the older kids have a sense of it, but even the ones who are older have physical delays _ an 8-year-old with the intelligence of a 5-year-old,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. `` But we do n't have that many older kids, so we do n't know.''

 The reigning drama of 1980 was not so much the <PERSON> Carter-Reagan </PERSON> campaign but the interminable hostage crisis in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The two became intertwined, and as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> gave up his presidency, 52 Americans were being returned to freedom. `` The pain's gone; the weight's lifted,'' <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Morefield </PERSON> exulted as her husband ended 444 days of nerve-wracking captivity. `` We can all drink to this one,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Cut to 1988. Another presidential campaign is in high gear and a new set of Americans is held captive in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. This time around, the hostages are bound and blindfolded far from the political limelight; the hope is that obscurity will diminish their value. For <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Tuesday will mark three full years as hostage. It has been 1,094 days since <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, returning from a tennis game, was shoved at gunpoint into a waiting car. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is an old friend, your basic boy-next-door, off to see the world in a foreign correspondent's trench coat. He has an enviable talent for finding the story and telling it straight, whether in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. We spent our salad days together in <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> bureau; he filed the state broadcast wire and lived out towards <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> with his family and a wonderful collection of Japanese etchings. From <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he became <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent by way of tours in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1984, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and I had lunch in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and he caught me up on the dangers and satisfaction of reporting the complex story of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. I told him we called it `` wartornLebanon'' as if it were one long word. He laughed. Now he is a part of the wartornLebanon story, longest held of some two dozen Westerners missing in the sad city of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. I was out pricing washing machines on Saturday, March 16, 1985, when a radio newscast said an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter had been kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. I figured it might be <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and it was. I figured he might be free by Monday, and he was n't. Who would have thought a year would go by, or two, let alone three? That his baby would be born and he would n't know? She would turn one, learn to walk, learn to talk, and he would n't know. Last spring she turned two. Is she a terrible two? Is she eating her vegetables? He would n't know. The washing machine is three years old and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is still the property of Shiite kidnappers, currency in a geopolitical ordeal that has killed two American hostages and threatens the remaining eight. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who negotiated tirelessly for all the Western hostages, now shares their fate. In March 1986, we marked the first <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> anniversary in a church on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. It was an optimistic gathering; perhaps freedom was just around the corner. Rarely had a hostage been held so long; we hoped he was holding up. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> celebrity-to-reporter, delivered a call for peace and brotherhood and deliverance. Hostage relatives expressed frustration, and more. `` There have been so many times that I was frightened they would do something to them,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, said of the six Americans then in captivity. Another hostage relative, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Franceschini </PERSON>, said, `` I'm on automatic pilot most of the time, but we made it through the holidays.'' Her brother, Rev. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenco </PERSON>, would be released in 1986, but for others, more holidays would pass and more Americans would be taken. The second <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> anniversary was marked at a second church, up 16th St. from the White House. The Iran-Contra story was out and it was clear that the hostages were key pawns in a multi-level `` arms for hostages'' intrigue. Optimism? Not so you could notice. The third <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> anniversary is upon us and Wednesday we gather in a third church, this time for a candlelight and olive branch ceremony in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>. The pain, not gone. The weight, not lifted. No one knows how <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> will mark the day. He was last heard from in a videotape on Christmas Eve, day 1,012.

<TEXT>
 Standing before an only mildly interested crowd at a county fair in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last week, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> introduced himself. `` I am the only active farmer in this race for president,'' he said, stirring as good an applause as he got for the rest of his speech. The 39-year-old Harvard-educated senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, perpetually clad in a blue suit, could be accused of stretching it a bit with that statement. True, home is a modest farmhouse hard by the <LOCATION> Caney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at rural <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, set amid the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> family farm operation. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, though, has hardly made his living working its soil. But his statement, often repeated, is emblematic of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as a man of varying backgrounds and worlds who has so far been able to balance them all. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> made the leap to the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates last week in the Super Tuesday primaries. He won six states, five in the South plus <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and accomplished his aim: to use the biggest ever regional primary to jump-start a presidential campaign. He faces the task now of backing up his claim of being more than a regional candidate. While he is competing in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary Tuesday, his hope is to advance as the primaries move across the <PERSON> North </PERSON>, arguing that he is the white alternative to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the delegate leader. He depicts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal who, if nominated, could cause another landslide Democratic loss. Now that the campaign has moved out of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> can be expected to rely less on his rural background than on his urban background. He has one of each. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is the son of a veteran <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> politician. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Sr. spent 32 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, first in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and later in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, before losing his seat in 1970. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was born and educated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and attended the elite <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albans </ORGANIZATION> prep school in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> or `` Tipper'' as she is better known, was a high school sweetheart in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was the all-American boy: bright, honors student, played basketball and football. He was accustomed to seeing the powerful of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and can tell stories as a youngster of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and then-Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Yet like the congressman he would become, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> kept up his ties back home. As his father faced his final battle for re-election, and his opposition to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War threatened his seat, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and was sent to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He served as an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> journalist. He returned to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and a reporter's job at the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessean </LOCATION>, hired by the publisher himself. He entered both divinity school and law school, not completing either. He quit law school after two years when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat his father once held came open. Returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member himself, in 1976, and as a senator in 1984, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s Eastern background served him well. He was singled out early on by some monied, establishment Democrats as a young man on the move, a potential presidential candidate. He was well connected and worked hard. He immersed himself in the arcane, technical ins-and-outs of issues such as arms control, medical technology and the space program. As a campaigner, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> draws on his various backgrounds. In the South he told country-lawyer jokes and talked about hypnotizing chickens _ one of the rural arts he claims to have mastered. But he also won the endorsement of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> magazine, whose editor was a former teacher of his at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has also moved among <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s country music crowd. He campaigned with country singer <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, and rubbed elbows with hard-living country rebel <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Yet his wife <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> has led a campaign against raw lyrics in rock music, a campaign that has stirred opposition from some parts of the entertainment and music industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Gores </ORGANIZATION> have four children, ages 5 through 14, who live and go to school in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> sometimes brings along one or more of his children on campaign trips, without their mother, including 5-year-old <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> will turn 40 on March 31. If elected, he would be the youngest president ever, following the oldest. He often makes the comparison to young <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> following the elderly <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in 1960. Despite a voting record decidedly more liberal than some of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s other representatives, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly four years ago when Republican <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> declined to run again. Whenever a questioner challenge's <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s claim to be a moderate, or his credentials as a son of the South, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> recalls that 1984 election. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won 61 percent of the vote, running ahead of even <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who got 58 percent of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s vote.

Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To judge from the vitriolic campaign, Salvadorans have a choice between thieves and murderers when they cast their ballots in legislative and municipal elections next Sunday. Tough campaigning has been common in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the years when civilian politics has prevailed over the exercise of power by force of arms. But this time around the denigration of opposing parties' candidates and institutions has eclipsed most attempts to inform the electorate of proposals for resolving this tiny Central American country's tremendous problems At stake are all 60 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the mayorships and councils of 262 municipalities nationwide. About 1.9 million of the country's 5 million people are eligible to vote. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> are expected to lose their majority in the assembly and such a defeat would turn President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s last year in office into an uphill climb. `` The election campaign is poisoning the country, deepening resentment and hate and putting even farther off the reconciliation of a divided people,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON> in his column in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prensa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grafica </LOCATION>, the nation's most widely read paper. Monsignor <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said in his homily Sunday: `` We would like to be able to say that the politicians offer a clear alternative to the violent methods that affect innocent people. But the political forum has likewise been converted into a war of insults.'' The party expected to make the biggest gains is the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, an ultra-rightist group. Prominent Christian Democrats have conceded they have little chance of retaining their majority. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, the front-runner for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, predicted at a recent news conference that his party would lose eight of its current 33 seats in the assembly. Presidential elections are scheduled for next year. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> attributed the decline to `` the natural erosion of support experienced by a party that governs in difficult times.'' <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is suffering in its eighth year of a civil war that has killed about 65,000 people, displaced 500,000 and ravaged its economy. The leftist guerrilla alliance battling the U.S.-supported government has denounced the elections as a farce and declared the voting will not be allowed to proceed in the northern and eastern regions under rebel control. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> receives more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid than any country in the Western hemisphere. Economic and military aid last year was more than $ 500 million. The military said last week it could guarantee voting in 244 of the 262 municipalities. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> said 40,000 troops will be deployed to guard against any guerrilla attempts to disrupt the voting. Eight parties _ all centrist or rightist _ are presenting candidates, but only three are competing nationwide. Left-of-center parties declined to participate, citing lack of security for their candidates. Rightist death squads killed several thousand leftist union and political activists in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the early 1980s. Human rights groups say the squads remain intact, and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> recently denounced what it said was an increase in the number of politically motivated murders. Arena and its founder, retired army Maj. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, have been linked to the death squads since the party's formation in 1982. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> campaign rally in <LOCATION> Panchimalco </LOCATION>, six miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, speakers repeatedly referred to <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>'s group as `` torturers'' and `` killers.'' Arena, for its part, calls the <ORGANIZATION> PDC </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s initials in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ the party of the corrupt. Arena, which has 13 legislators in the current assembly, is not expected to win an outright majority. But most observers believe it will win almost as many seats as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That could leave the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the third group competing nationwide _ with the balance of power. The rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was formed by the military and governed for nearly 20 years before a 1979 coup. It formed an alliance with <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in the 1985 legislative elections. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in an effort to portray itself as moderate, eschewed the alliance this time around. `` Against the death squads and the thieves, <ORGANIZATION> PCN </ORGANIZATION>,'' has been its slogan in this campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which groups five rebel organizations, said in a communique last month: `` The country has lost its sovereignty -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and democracy does not exist. Rather there is a new kind of military dictatorship with a civilian facade. Without independence, no election is legitimate.''

<HEAD>Farmers Not Only Recipients of Farm Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The record high subsidies paid out by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> all went to farmers, right? Not quite, says the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. In the last three fiscal years, according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, net cash outlays for farm price and income support programs totaled about $ 67 billion. Of that amount, farmers got about 80 percent, or $ 53 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, provided a breakdown of recent farm program costs in a report requested by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> divided the record fiscal 1987 cash outlay of more than $ 25.8 billion into two parts: about $ 23.5 billion in `` commodity specific'' expenditures such as deficiency payments, loans and storage payments, and $ 2.36 billion in `` non-commodity specific'' items, including export programs, conservation payments and operating expense. Overall, four commodities _ corn, wheat, dairy and cotton _ account for most of the program costs registered by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In fiscal 1987, for example, when the total was $ 25.8 billion, corn and other feed grains accounted for $ 12.2 billion; wheat, $ 3.44 billion; dairy, $ 2.34 billion; and cotton, $ 2.14 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said that of the $ 25.8 billion total in fiscal 1987, farmers received $ 20.6 billion. `` While farmers received most of the support program's outlays, it is unknown how much of those outlays went to individual farmers versus farmers organized under some other business structure,'' the report said. `` Farmers organize, operate and receive the support program outlays as any one of various business entities.'' The report added that those entities can include individual proprietorship, partnership, association, cooperative, corporation, trust or estate. Moreover, investigators said they were told that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> does not maintain records of farm program outlays by the various types of farm businesses. `` Farmers receive the support program outlays as producers of the supported agricultural commodities regardless of their business structure,'' the report said. About $ 3.9 billion went to non-farmers in fiscal 1986. Those included `` commercial operators engaged in farming-related activities, or to other recipients who may or may not be farmers'' for a variety of reasons, including direct purchases of commodities, storage and handling, transportation, and claims under export guarantee programs. Operating expenses and related administrative costs added $ 2.3 billion to the 1987 total. But the 1987 operation of <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> also include around $ 1 million in proceeds from sales of commodities, with that amount credited against the other outlays.

 The Census Bureau says farmers should remember to return their survey questionnaires describing 1987 operations. Although the form was due on Feb. 1, the bureau said it recognizes that some may be running late. Besides, the law requires it. `` Use your best estimates if you do n't have the information in your records,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said. `` Return your forms to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> even if you did not grow any crops, or have any livestock, poultry or other agricultural products in 1987, so the bureau can correct its records.'' Officials said if help is needed, call the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s toll-free number, 1-800-233-6132 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> residents should call 1-800-233-6135. `` You may also obtain help from local offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and vocational agriculture teachers,'' the agency said. The federal law requiring farmers and ranchers to respond to the census `` also protects the privacy of their reports,'' the bureau said.

 Government trade figures show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports in the first three months of the 1988 fiscal year were on target with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> projections. The value of shipments in the first quarter of the year that began Oct. 1 was estimated at $ 8.46 billion, up 10 percent from the pace of a year earlier, according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Department officials have forecast 1987-88 exports at $ 32.5 billion, up from $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87. The actual volume of shipments in the first quarter was reported at 36.2 million tons, up 11 percent from a year earlier. For the year, those are expected to total about 142.5 million metric tons, up from 129.2 million tons in 1986-87. `` Strong wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, strong corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, as well as improved soybean sales to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, strengthened export volume,'' the agency said in a recent trade report.

<HEAD>Crime Rate Stable Third Straight Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 34.4 million crimes were committed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, the third straight year of stable crime levels, according to a government survey. Since 1980, violent crimes have fallen from 33 per 1,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents to 28, thefts from 83 to 68 per 1,000, and household crimes from 227 to 168, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Sunday. Crime levels overall rose a statistically insignificant 0.9 percent last year from 34.1 million in 1986. `` Total crime has remained stable during the last three years'' and remains at a 14-year low, according to <ORGANIZATION> BJS </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. There were 5.5 million violent crimes in 1987, up 0.4 percent from the previous year. Thefts totaled 13.45 million last year, up 1.7 percent from 1986. Household crimes of burglary, larceny and auto theft totaled 15.4 million, up 0.4 percent from the previous year. Only motor vehicle thefts grew significantly, by 15 percent to an estimated 1.6 million. Some criminologists had been predicting continued declines in crime levels for a few more years, based on the fact that the most crime-prone age group continues to shrink in size. Those researchers predict an increase in crime in the early 1990s as the children of parents born during the post-World War II baby boom move into the 14 - to 24-year-old age bracket in significant numbers The crime-prone 14 - to 24-year-old age group totaled 42.5 million in 1986, down nearly 4 million from the 1979 peak One factor that could have caused the decline of crime rate in the early 1980s to stabilize may be increased use of serious drugs, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumstein </PERSON>, dean of the school of urban and public affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Illicit drug use among criminal defendants is high and seems to be on the increase, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said last month at a news conference. Another possibility, <PERSON> Blumstein </PERSON> said, may be that people now in their late teen years are disproportionately from a low-income population, which traditionally has shown more involvement in the crimes measured by the national survey.

 Some lawmakers say they think a group of congressional aides used bad judgment in attending a secret meeting in January with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` It was very foolish,'' Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said last week after the meeting became public `` That was the wrong thing to do.'' The two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on U.S.-Arab Relations, took place in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a few weeks after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation closing the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> offices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the grounds the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supports terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathell </PERSON>, executive director of the council, said the meeting was constructive because it gave the congressional aides a chance to see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the flesh and conduct a `` candid, forthright'' discussion with him. In response to a question from one Capitol Hill staff member, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told the group the man he admired most in history was Saint <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> because the disciple of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` conquered <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> by winning the hearts'' of f the staffers.

All but one of the aides on the trip attended the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> meeting, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said, speaking on condition he remain Several aides who traveled to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to talk about what happened in the meeting, and would only discuss the trip if their names were not used. After the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> meeting, group members realized the significance of their action and made a pact to keep it secret, one said. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said he was upset when he learned an aide had seen <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> without his permission. `` She acted independently, and I had no knowledge of this meeting nor would I have approved it, and I remain very disturbed about it.'' The staffer no longer works for <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, but left for personal reasons unrelated to the meeting. <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, however, was unconcerned. He said his assistant `` was not on any official trip and he was traveling in a personal capacity.'' But several <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffers who deal exclusively with foreign policy _ the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in particular _ said they never would have accepted the invitation in view of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The meeting was `` extremely unwise when as a matter of law <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials are not supposed to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusen </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The policy _ imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ prohibits officials in the executive branch from negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until the group recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. But the policy does not apply to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and a few lawmakers as well as staff members have met openly with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the past. Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for example, saw <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in a bunker in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> complained that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> failed to advise his aide about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, refusing to be identified by name, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador had tried to dissuade the Americans from meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. No embassy personnel went to the session. The original agenda did not list an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> meeting. Once the group arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cathell </PERSON> said he learned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader was in town and broached the possibility of a meeting with the congressional aides. The staffers were never pressured to attend the meeting, <PERSON> Cathell </PERSON> said. Instead they were told, `` It's totally up to you,'' he said. One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the group was given less than an hour's notice that a face-to-face meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had been set. The national council seeks to promote understanding between Americans and Arabs, and receives its money from grants and private and corporate contributions.

 The rat pack is back. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, reunited for a 29-city, 40-show tour Sunday night, brought their unique blend of fun times and good tunes to the old fans who loved'em way back when and young fans who'd never had the chance. `` How long have I been on?'' deadpanned <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> after walking absent-mindedly onto stage holding a cigarette and a glass of bourbon at the start of the sold-out concert. He then sang `` When You're Smiling,'' changing the last word to drinking. To rousing applause and a few shouts of `` louder,'' he then sang `` Bourbon From Heaven.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, flashing his trademark gold jewelry hanging in chains down his chest, was given a standing ovation for `` I've Got to Be Me,'' his signature song. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> drew applause when he mentioned he'd been in show business 59 years and had been sober for three years. The crowd applauded enthusiastically when he performed songs such as `` Candy Man'' and `` What Kind of Fool am I?'' <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was the real crowd pleaser, drawing huge ovations from the packed house when he belted out such favorites as `` For Once In My Life,'' `` Mack the Knife,'' `` You are the Sunshine of My Life,'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> rejoined <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> for the closing finale, which featured a lot of kidding along with medleys of pop favorites from the last four decades. `` As far as we're concerned,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, `` and I can say this for both of us, you're still the chairman of the board.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> added, `` Yeah, you're still the chairman, we're still bored.'' The tour's opening show at the sold-out <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION> also marked the 48th anniversary of <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s first stage show: a 1940 appearance at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Paramount Theatre with big band leader <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>. `` The three of us, we love each other, and we have more fun than the audience,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said when the tour was announced in January. `` We're going to cities where none of those people have ever, never, seen anything like us.'' The 70-year-old joker vowed to get the audience laughing `` and then they will continue laughing while these guys sing.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, age 62 and 72 respectively, first appeared with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> at the Sands Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in January 1960. They made frequent guest appearances in each others' shows and made a number of films together, including such box office hits as `` Ocean's Eleven,'' `` Sergeants Three,'' and `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and the Seven Hoods.'' <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>, were among the 14,500 fans at the concert, many of whom decked themselves out in evening and cocktail dresses and sports coats and suits. They said they have been fans of <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> since the late 40s. Mrs. <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> said she was so devoted to her idol that `` my mother always said I was the one who made him famous.'' `` I've seen <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> before, and I grew up listening to his music,'' said <PERSON> Lydia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Her 35-year-old brother, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, said he came to watch the fun. `` This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' he said. `` If I did n't see them now I'd never get another chance. The trio picked up the `` rat pack'' moniker after actor <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> used that label for a large group of entertainers that lived in the same area of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. For the last two decades, they've performed mainly in the glitzy showrooms of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> has joked that the troupers wanted to go on tour so that `` people could see how bad we are.'' The idea of touring surfaced when the three longtime friends gathered at <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s house. It became possible because all three are under contract to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The shows, with top tickets going for $ 40, will be backed up by a 35-piece orchestra. Home Box Office plans to broadcast a special on the show later. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> are among a growing number of aging superstars whose careers only seem stronger with age. Comics <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caeser </PERSON> recently appeared in a made-for-television movie, `` Side By Side.'' <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> have all found themselves under contract for one-man shows. And then there's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, 92, who has a new movie coming out in April. He's booked to play the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Paladium when he turns 100. In a recent interview for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekend </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> offered a few kind words for the rat pack: `` I'm sure those three kids will make it. I think <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> has potential. He just has to build some confidence. All three will be big stars if they keep working at it.'' The `` Together Again'' tour continues in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, B.C., on Tuesday, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Friday and Saturday.

 It comes as a small but meaningful reward to <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> that the people in her hometown are rallying behind her call to remember the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There were many times when it seemed people did n't want to hear about how her brother, journalist <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, was still being held. There was the stinging criticism that maybe she was somehow to blame for his prolonged captivity. It's different now. Her brother's defiant expression is seen on posters in the stores and restaurants of this rural upstate town 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. The posters say: `` Remember <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> on the anniversary of his captivity, March 16, 1988. Please wear a yellow ribbon and pray for the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Prayer services, a rally and a candlelight march down main street are scheduled to mark the beginning of the fourth year of captivity for the 40-year-old <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the first time we've gotten this kind of support,'' said Mrs. Say. `` People just assumed that the government's quiet diplomacy was the answer. Now, I think they realize it is n't working. Many of this week's activities in <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> grew up, have been organized by the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>, pastor and friend of the Say family. <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON> asked florists to donate ribbon to decorate downtown. While most of the town's seven florists agreed, one shop provided more than 2 miles of yellow ribbon. Inside <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>'s flower shop are thousands of yellow bows, hung on garlands, that are being handed out to residents who request them. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> said that it was `` just a small thing'' he could do to help. A nun at <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has made a huge greeting card that will be on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Genesee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> beginning Saturday so that residents can sign it. It will be sent to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Mrs. Say's daughter, <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewington </PERSON>, said the turnout for an observance of the anniversary last year was disappointing. This time the response has been overwhelming, she said. Mrs. Say will not be here, but at the <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for a service for hostage family members. `` I wish I could be here, too,'' she said. `` There has been such an outpouring of concern. It would please <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> so much to know that people really have n't forgotten him.'' There are 22 foreigners, including nine Americans, missing and believed held by Moslem fundamentalists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has been held the longest. From ex-hostages and other sources, Mrs. Say has learned that her brother is being held alone in a windowless room, fighting the boredom and loneliness of his solitary existence. He is often blindfolded and has been beaten and harassed. Mrs. Say has been tireless in calling for more to be done for the hostages. `` If they -LRB- the hostages -RRB- are no longer important to the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or this administration, then -LRB- the captors -RRB- will think they have to make a political statement by executing them. That's what waits for them if all of us do n't keep them alive in the public eye.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> likes to say he has the `` poor campaign with a rich message,'' but he may have to alter that slogan a bit if his fund-raising trends continue. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mail consultant <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not in the league of other multi-million-dollar presidential contenders, the response to his mail solicitations is so overwhelming that <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> has had to increase his 12-person money-counting staff to 30 over the past two months. It is too early to tell how <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong showing in the Super Tuesday states will affect his contributions, <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> said. But he added, `` Money has been coming in so far ahead of projections that we are struggling to keep up with it.'' The mail results have grown steadily since last fall, when about $ 150,000 per month was coming in, said campaign treasurer <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON>. That increased to about $ 270,000 in January. And in February, the month when primaries and caucuses began, $ 400,000 of the $ 750,000 the campaign raised came in through the mail, <PERSON> Renzi </PERSON> said. `` We're starting to approach the time where we'll have the financial wherewithal to be more competitive,'' he said, adding that a good part of the money raised by mail is going back into the mail program to develop a bigger base of contributors. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> still has a long way to go to catch up with Democratic money leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had raised some $ 15 million by the end of January, including federal matching funds, to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s $ 3.3 million <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made much of the fact that he has done well despite being outspent by as much as 30 times in states where his opponents put on heavy media campaigns. But his sophisticated mail program is producing results that were unheard of in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, when taking a collection at revival-style rallies was his most frequent fund-raising approach. <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> runs a state-of-the-art direct mail and telemarketing operation, utilizing lists of names purchased from other mail soliciters to determine which categories of people would be most likely to give to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We're using every technique in the book,'' he said, and sending mail to a broad spectrum of progressive Democrats. The mail includes everything from postcards to sophisticated packets and questionnaires through first-class mail. In addition to the mail, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, influential speaker of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state assembly, said there will be a series of concerts to raise money in the weeks to come. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, one of the most successful fund-raisers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politics, also said this week he will try to extract $ 1 million from the state's `` bleeding hearts'' whom he said should be giving money to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> said about one mailing per week goes out, ranging in size from 5,000 pieces to previous contributors, to 400,000 pieces in a search for new donors. `` The results we are obtaining are as strong as anything I've ever witnessed in all my time of direct mail fund-raising,'' <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firm, <ORGANIZATION> Changing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, handled direct mail for the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> last year before <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> dropped out of the race the first time, and has several liberal organizations as clients. One `` Dear Fellow American Citizen'' letter from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was sent to white liberal Democratics in affluent <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In what the industry calls the `` involvement'' approach, it included an `` issues survey'' asking the reader's opinion on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s key issues. Another mailing that went out after the Feb. 8 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses highlighted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 8 percent showing in a state with a 1.4 percent black population as evidence that he has support outside the black community, contrary to what `` so called political experts'' had claimed. <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> said that since names on his mailing lists are `` overwhelmingly non-black,'' white people obviously are contributing to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` For us to get the results we are getting means he has very substantial support among white mail donors,'' he said. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> would not be specific on the rate of return for the amount of mail sent out, but said it was `` much better'' than the 1 percent to 1.5 percent return that is typical for so-called prospecting mail, in which new donors are sought out.

 Super Tuesday's muddled Democratic results could give <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and at least one prominent <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politician a bigger share of the political spotlight. Since Democratic contenders <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> emerged from the round of contests on March 8 tightly clustered in the delegate race, more attention is being paid to the late contests, such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 primary. And <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the flamboyant national chairman of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, is waiting in the wings for what could be a key role. The importance and influence of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the consummate deal-maker and power broker of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> over the past decade, is growing with the prospect of a brokered Democratic convention. If <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ultimately falls short of winning enough delegates for nomination, every extra delegate he wins increases the chances of a deadlocked convention _ and the chance that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and top advisers like <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will have a say in deciding who is the nominee. If it comes to that, Democrats will again be facing the quandary of trying to make enough concessions to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to keep his supporters while not conceding enough to alienate other constituencies _ creating a situation in which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s negotiating skills could be especially important. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has said repeatedly that he is n't maneuvering for a brokered convention, but rather for a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> victory. `` The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign wants the nomination,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> reporters last week. `` We may well determine the Democratic nomination with the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vote. Probably <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the favorite at the moment -LRB- in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s first choice for the nomination was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, and he signed on with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> only after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> declined to run. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has repeatedly and heatedly denied speculation that he took the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign chairmanship to be in a position to deliver <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> votes to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at a deadlocked convention, saying that he is supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because he believes he is the best candidate and can win. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is n't the only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politician coming in for attention where the presidential race is concerned. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. But <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> has a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant governor who would take over if he stepped aside. That would diminish the Republican support in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> he would otherwise be expected to add to a national ticket. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> himself has said he would `` absolutely, unequivocably, not under any circumstances'' accept the nomination. `` Even if offered the opportunity, I would not be able to do it, and I would not,'' he says. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> refuses to speculate publicly on why he keeps being mentioned as vice presidential material when he's made it known he's not interested. One of his advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, says: `` It's just window-dressing. They all want a Westerner on their lists, and he's the biggest name out here. But they all know the situation, and that he's serious when he says he is n't available.''

 Comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> won four People's Choice Awards and the movie `` Fatal Attraction'' won three from an admiring public that also bestowed honors on Cybill Shepherd, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>. `` This is particularly special for me,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, named favorite female television performer for her role in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting'' despite a shortened role last year due to her pregnancy with twins `` When you're out of the limelight, you're pregnant with twins and gain 45 pounds and you go through this enormous change, it always goes through the back of your mind, ` Are they going to forget?' `` It's really nice to know they did n't forget.'' The public chose the winners in the 14th annual People's Choice Awards, broadcast Sunday night by <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Winners were determined by a Gallup poll of 5,000 people older than 12, a statistical representation of nearly 196 million people. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> was named favorite male TV performer for the fourth-consecutive year and favorite all-around male entertainer for the third. He also won a new award _ all-time favorite TV star _ while his top-rated <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series, `` The Cosby Show,'' won its fourth comedy program award. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` L.A. Law'' was the favorite TV dramatic program. `` Three Men and A Baby'' won for comedy movie and `` Fatal Attraction'' for dramatic motion picture. Its leads, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, were picked top motion picture performers. `` I want to thank you as my favorite father, and a supporter,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> told his father, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who presented the award. `` I got so nervous when I got up I did n't thank the people,'' Miss Close said afterward. `` And that's what makes it so special. It's just a cross section of people who have nothing to do with the industry.'' <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> was chosen all-time favorite movie star, an award presented by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, a middle-class black neighborhood of brick bungalows and neat lawns, people like <PERSON> Clevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> are pulling for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and proud of his Democratic presidential bid. `` You ca n't talk to nobody in <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> unless it's about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 66, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant. `` They have a belief they can help him become the Democratic nominee for president.'' On the tree-lined streets of <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> on the predominantly black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries filled many with hope that maybe, just maybe, a black could be elected president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Most people who paused to talk about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chances said they would vote for him and his slated convention delegates in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary election `` Every vote counts,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` All I can say is he's got a chance He's got as good a chance as he'll ever have.'' Like many black neighborhoods across the financial spectrum, <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> country. It's a community of about 40,000 people where the median family income was nearly $ 19,000 in the 1980 census. Most people have jobs and many own their homes, mainly one - and two-story brick bungalows with an average value of $ 39,200, the census found `` I would describe <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> as a rock-solid black middle-income community and one that has been that way for probably 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s director of community development planning. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s work over the years with Operation PUSH, the civil-rights group he founded, and his two presidential campaigns have won the respect of many residents, said housewife <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blissitt </PERSON>, 50. `` He's done a lot for black people,'' she said. `` He's someone we look up to. He speaks out for what really concerns black people. We've sort of been shoved aside by all the other candidates. `` Because we are a minority, I do n't know if he actually could make it to the presidency,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blissitt </PERSON> said. `` But I'm glad he's running if for nothing more than to show black kids they can do it, to give them a goal to strive for. Several people shared her pessimism about whether the nation's white majority would elect a black president `` People I talk to say he wo n't make it, due to the fact of his color,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, 47, an apartment-building janitor. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said he planned to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> because he likes his background as a preacher and thinks his bid for the presidency shows `` guts.'' `` One thing about him being black, he was n't born with a silver spoon in his mouth,'' he added. `` He knows the feeling.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, also a janitor, paused as he weeded shrubbery in front of an apartment building and grinned as he thought about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s Super Tuesday success. `` I was surprised, but I really liked that. It made me feel good,'' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>, 61. `` Most people I've talked to _ they really think he's going to win. And everybody I've talked to said they were going to vote for him.'' But <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 66, a retired tax examiner, said she was torn between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the state's other favorite son. Both candidates seem honest, straightforward and committed to their principles now, she said, but `` all of them are full of you know what.'' `` They promise you one thing and do another when they get in,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made an impressive showing in Democratic caucuses in his native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> over the weekend and now takes aim at Tuesday's primary in his adopted <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. A record turnout estimated at 45,000 people attended the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> precinct caucuses Saturday. When the meetings were over, it appeared the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native would collect 23 of the state's 48 national convention delegates Fifteen of the delegates apparently will be uncommitted while six will go to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The state also has four super delegates which were not at stake in Saturday's meetings. `` We the people have won <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd of about 400 supporters gathered Saturday night at <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a campaign of hope. Each victory adds another to win.'' On Sunday, campaigning in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he expected his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> victory would give him momentum going into the Tuesday primary in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> delegate estimates were based on reports from 93 percent of the state's 1,788 precincts. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahre </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it could be a couple of days before all the numbers are in. `` The problem now becomes the county party priorities are preparing for their county conventions,'' she said. State officials must `` beg a lot'' to get the numbers in, she said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> all campaigned in the state in the days before the caucuses. `` Clearly <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the undecided are the big winners in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said while campaigning in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s state campaign chairman, state Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheheen </PERSON>, D-Kershaw, claimed that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s finish above <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` is a significant victory.'' `` I thought if we ran neck and neck with the uncommitted that would be a great achievement,'' he said, adding he expects the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign to fold before the state convention giving <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> a chance to pick up more uncommitted delegates. The state organizer for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Belton </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeigler </PERSON>, said the campaign did n't spend much money in the state and `` whatever we get is gravy in the caucus campaign.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, the state campaign coordinator for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said `` we're going to make our stand in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' He expressed hope that a strong showing there later this month would allow the congressman to pick up some uncommitted delegates at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state convention next month. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> political scientist, said the record turnout was due to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s organizing and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s strong showing on Super Tuesday `` With <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home state, there was a very strong incentive in the black community,'' he said. `` Some of it was due to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s showing on Super Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> added. `` Some Democrats felt there was a candidate out there they could support.'' Before Super Tuesday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was way back in polls in the state and he covered a lot of ground in just a few days, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` But it's hard for him to claim a victory when he comes in behind the undecided,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> added.

 The high road to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> for a 130-member high school band from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> led through a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hospital, where a schoolmate is recovering from bone cancer surgery. The <ORGANIZATION> Belding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> band members, who raised $ 1,000 apiece to march in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s St. Patrick's Day parade and celebrate the Irish capital's 1,000 th anniversary, traveled 200 miles by bus Sunday to O'Hare International Airport Before departing, though, they made a side trip to serenade 17-year-old <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON>. Their instruments were being packed aboard the plane, so the musicians who gathered in the lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wyler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and sang Because <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> is fighting cancer, they sang the Belding fight song, and because he is their friend, they sang the band's theme song, `` Friends.'' `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s not a band member but he is a good friend,'' said band director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiles </PERSON>. `` We just want to remind him that he's one of us and show our love and concern.'' About 95 Belding parents also were on hand to surprise <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> as he emerged from an elevator in his wheelchair. `` There was n't a dry eye in the whole building,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> `` He did n't know they were coming, and it took him a minute or two to figure out what was happening. Then he started crying like all the rest of us.'' `` That's the kind of town Belding is,'' she said of the small apple-growing community 30 miles east of Grand Rapids. `` We know almost everyone there and we consider them all friends.'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was diagnosed as having bone cancer Dec. 10, a day after his 17th birthday, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said. Before his illness, he had been an active high school junior, too busy helping at his parents' grocery store and working a part-time job at a hardware store to have time for extracurricular activities like athletics or the band For a while after his diagnosis, he was able to attend school several days a week between chemotherapy treatments, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said, but schoolwork had to stop when he came here for surgery. The family had to sell their store, `` because we knew we would n't have time to run it with all the trips to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where she stays when she is visiting <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>. `` Everybody was here for the serenade,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON>. `` My husband, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, our 18-year-old son, our 7-year-old daughter, our 5-month-old baby and even <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayborn </PERSON>, who run the hardware store where <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> worked. Seeing them is what really got to him.'' On March 4, doctors at the hospital removed a tumor from <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s left leg and implanted part of a femur They also installed a mechanical knee joint. The relatively new surgical technique, called limb salvage, avoids amputation, and should allow <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> to walk normally in the future, Mrs. <PERSON> Mikek </PERSON> said. `` He'll be in the hospital about another two weeks, and then will begin physical therapy,'' she said. `` All he wants right now is to be able to walk again, and everything's on hold until he does.''

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says he still regards as a friend the man whose memos have made him a target of a criminal investigation into a $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also denies that he untruthfully played down his involvement in promoting the project with then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. A memo by longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says that on Oct. 16, 1985, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had a `` three-way discussion'' of the project at the Israeli Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Sunday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, said `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s account totally exaggerates'' the discussion `` in order to impress his client,'' Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a partner in the pipeline project <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said it is a `` cheap shot'' and `` stupid'' to suggest that the memo contradicts <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s earlier portrayals of his contacts with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as limited. In a statement issued Feb. 1, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that his total involvement with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on the pipeline consisted of `` only two contacts ... Each was brief, limited, and neither was initiated by me.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first disclosed the memo in its Sunday editions, is `` taking a small fact that's well known and trying to blow it up into a new news story.'' The memo discussing the meeting had not been previously reported prior to the Post article. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was paid $ 150,000 by <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> and when <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the project, the attorney general referred him to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is my friend,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in remarks Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> has never asked me to do anything that was wrong,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. He said `` a lot of people are taking a very simple situation'' and `` they're trying to make a big deal out of it.'' Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mckay </PERSON> is investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s role in the pipeline as a result of a memo written to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> mentioning planned payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a bid to protect the project in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from Israeli attack. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he does n't recall the portion of the memo dealing with the planned payments. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> directed that the $ 150,000 he received from <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> be placed in an account under the control of <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, an investment adviser for both <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. The $ 150,000 ended up being pooled with funds from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in several stock trades. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s initial $ 50,000 investment grew to $ 95,000 with profits from the stock deals, but the attorney general denied in his television appearance that he profited from the $ 150,000. He said he was not aware at the time of the payment from <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> predicted that he would be exonerated in <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe and said `` I should n't step aside because if honest public officials can be hounded out of office by partisan political attacks ... then no one as a public official is safe.'' Another memo by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, also described in Sunday's Post, recounts a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> involving <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and then-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the meeting lasted about 15 minutes and that the four discussed two proposed letters for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to sign, the first committing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to disrupt the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pipeline and the second dealing with the possibility of using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as insurance. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has said in the past that he recalls having met <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> only twice, on social occasions with others present. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> eventually signed a later version of the first letter, but he said he could not act on the second letter without additional consultations in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The pipeline project collapsed shortly thereafter, for want of an insurance package which the Iraqis demanded in the event <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> destroyed the pipeline. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> saw legal obstacles to using Israeli aid money as part of an insurance package.

<HEAD>Computer Scientists Set Speed Record For Solving Complex Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> have cast aside a popular theory and developed a new method to dramatically boost the speed of solving complex problems with parallel computers, which work on many parts of a problem at the same time. `` We have achieved results that most computer scientists thought impossible a couple of years ago,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> computer scientist. <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday that <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> and other scientists at the lab had broken records for speedups, a measure of the increased speed at which a problem can be solved on a multiprocessor parallel computer, compared with a single processor from the same system. Single data processors, like those in home computers, solve problems one step at a time, in sequence, like balancing a checkbook. Parallel computers use many processors linked together so they can share the load, each working on a different piece of a problem at the same time, like a lot of people each doing one page of a checkbook. The theory applied to parallel processing had predicted speedups of 50 to 100 times. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> scientists achieved speedups of more than 1,000 times. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsis </PERSON>, director of computer sciences and mathematics at <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION>, said in an interview that large-scale parallel computing could be used in such areas as defense work, weather forecasting or solving large economic problems. <PERSON> Barsis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> scientists basically ignored a popular belief in computer circles based on a speedup theory dubbed <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION>'s Law. <ORGANIZATION> Amdahl </ORGANIZATION>'s Law says that no matter how many processors might be linked in parallel, the problem-solving speed could be increased at most by 50 to 100 times that of a single processor because the increase would be limited by the small portion of any computer program that can not be chopped up and run in parallel. <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> scientists decided to jump ahead and work with 1,000 or more processors at the same time. `` After you think about it for a while, you think it's obvious,'' <PERSON> Barsis </PERSON> said. `` The idea is that you have to get all the processors to work together,'' <PERSON> Barsis </PERSON> said. `` You have to make it so they do n't get bogged down in communication -LRB- with each other -RRB- rather than computing.'' Specialists in the field said <LOCATION> Sandia </LOCATION>'s findings appeared very significant. `` All the speedups sound very, very good for me. They sound very significant,'' <PERSON> Anoop </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, professor of computer science at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Friday. `` But I would have to know more details. On the whole, however, they sound very good.'' `` We think it's a very exciting result,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gear </PERSON>, head of the department of computer science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. Gear is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> and managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> SIAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> and Statistical Computing. He read the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> paper on the breakthrough, submitted for publication in the journal, last week. `` Normally, from the time it -LRB- a paper -RRB- comes in until it appears in print, it may be two years,'' he said. `` We're going to try to publish it in July.'' The Sandia scientists developed mathematical and computational methods, or algorithms, tailored to handle large scientific problems. The problems were worked out on a parallel supercomputer called an NCUBE-ten, made by <ORGANIZATION> NCUBE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beaverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> has the only NCUBE-ten, which uses 1,024 processors It is less than 3 feet on a side but is the largest computer in the world in numbers of processors operating in parallel and in the 7.7 billion bytes, or characters, it can move per second, <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, along with fellow <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> scientists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Montry </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Womble </PERSON>, achieved speedups of 1,020, 1,019 and 1,011 on three full-scale scientific application problems, the officials said. `` We have come almost all the way to the theoretical limit for a 1,024-processor machine,'' <PERSON> Benner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Noteholders Balk at First City Buyout Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Note holders are balking at accepting less than 50 cents on the dollar as part of a plan to bail out the troubled <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, federal officials say. The $ 1.5 billion rescue plan _ which would be the second largest government bank bailout in history _ calls for $ 970 million in federal assistance, a $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, and a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets. But <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, director of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that holders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s debt securities are reluctant to go along with the plan He said it would require the note holders to settle for less than the face value of the notes. The amounts offered to the note holders ranged from 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar, he said. According to <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> told federal regulators during weekend meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that not enough of the note holders have agreed to sell at those prices. `` The agreement provides that we have to have a 90 percent response to that tender offer, and Mr. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> advised us that that level has not been reached,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said he did n't know how far the tender offers were from the 90 percent level and added that the note holders have until Tuesday afternoon to respond. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is working with Mr. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> and his investor group to handle <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> on an alternate basis should the tender not be successful,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> stressed that people with accounts at the bank will be protected. He said <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will use its powers `` to assure stability in <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks and in the banking system.'' However, he would not disclose what alternatives would be considered to the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> plan which <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> shareholders approved March 4. `` Whatever alternative way we'll come up with will ensure stability for First City and for the banking system as a whole,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has statutory authority to handle imminent or potential failed bank situations in various ways. ... We'll deal with that on Tuesday, not to say that they'll have an announcement on Tuesday.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 970 million pledge to <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is the largest such government rescue of a bank since the 1984 federal bailout of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. First City grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate loan losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. It has assets of $ 11 billion and operates 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Under the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> plan, <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> would become chairman of the board and chief executive officer upon consummation of the deal. The proxy statement sent to shareholders before they approved the plan predicted the new company would become profitable almost immediately after spinning off the poorly performing assets.

 Reports that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may be planning to install Silkworm anti-ship missiles on a tiny island in the southern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> add a new element to a much-publicized threat that some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval officers say has been greatly overrated. Military sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said surveillance had detected evidence that crude missile launch pads were being built on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>, an outcropping long used as a base for armed speedboat attacks on gulf shipping by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was still no sign of the missiles being installed. Nor did they speculate on what purpose the Chinese-built weapons might serve if located there. But missiles on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> would extend the so-called `` Silkworm envelope'' along <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s coast bordering the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> by about 100 miles, `` doubling the arc'' of the present threat, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said. It would put the missiles, which have a maximum range of 50 to 60 miles, within easy reach of the main shipping channel leading to and from the Hormuz passage, as well as a populated stretch of the Arab coast. Five of the seven <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port cities _ <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ajman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Qaiwain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Khaimah </PERSON> _ are 50 miles or less from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON>. Gulf-area diplomats and shipping executives expressed alarm early last year when it was disclosed that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was deploying mobile Silkworm batteries along the Hormuz, the only outlet from the oil-rich gulf to the open sea. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was said to have successfully test-fired several of the missiles at an old ship's hulk. Subsequent reports have said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> possessed as many as 100 Silkworms, apparently supplied by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has publicly denied the sales. Senior American officials made it clear from the outset that any Iranian use of the weapon would be met with swift retaliation. Then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not contemplate `` pre-emptive strikes,'' even the activation of a Silkworm's target-tracking radar would be seen as a hostile act, to which the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would respond. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s subsequent reluctance to even threaten to use the missiles in the strategic Hormuz has caused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval officers to view the threat with increasing skepticism. The convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers continue to have protective air cover while passing through the `` envelope,'' but some warships now sail with crews at less than a full `` battle stations'' alert status, de rigeur when the operation began last July. `` Of course we ca n't rule the Silkworms out as a potential threat, but in my opinion it's been overrated _ right from the start,'' a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer said several months ago. Other American officers have said the Silkworms in the Hormuz are probably the least of their worries in sailing through the gulf. More imminent concerns include Iranian speedboats and most of all, another mistaken Iraqi air strike such as that which wrecked the missile frigate Stark, killing 37 Americans, last May 17. One senior officer said he would not discount the idea of some `` crazies'' firing a Silkworm in defiance of orders, but believed the danger from a planned attack was virtually nil. `` As long as we maintain our retaliatory assets in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, that is n't going to occur,'' he said, referring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier _ currently the nuclear-powered Enterprise _ permanently stationed outside the gulf. `` The Iranians are n't about to fire one of those things -LRB- Silkworms -RRB- at a warship or a ship under navy escort. They know what would happen if they did. They'd be taken out in minutes,'' he said. Friday's report of Silkworm-related activity on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> came just as the only U.S.-flagged ship ever hit by a Silkworm was sailing past the island. The 81,283-ton <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one of the 11 Kuwait-owned tankers reflagged with the Stars and Stripes for protection from Iranian attack, was heading out of the gulf in a navy convoy. It was the first trip for the ship since it was devastated by a Silkworm last Oct. 16 while anchored at <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s main offshore oil terminal. That missile, and a handful of others launched from Iran-held territory in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, are the only ones that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s forces are known to have fired. The Silkworm, officially designated HY-2 by the Chinese, is a variant of the 30-year-old Soviet Styx missile. The cumbersome, 20-foot-long projectile flies just above the water at subsonic speed, homing on its target by radar. Although the weapon is crude by modern standards, its 1,000-pound warhead can cause severe damage. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval officials called the hit on the <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a lucky shot, but the tanker was out of service for nearly five months.

<TEXT>
 If military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> steps down from his post as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and not <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s fledgling opposition, will have brought it about. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions freezing Panamanian assets have dealt a serious blow to the military regime of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking and other charges. But the opposition has done little to further the process. President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general late last month but instead was booted out of office himself and went underground, still recognized by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s head of state. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s wife, Mrs. <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, said last week that her husband was considering asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for military intervention. The opposition grouped under the Civic Crusade, an assortment of political parties, private groups and businessmen's associations, has tried to stir up a protest movement against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but failed to rally enough popular support for large street demonstrations. `` Only those with rifles can overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said an opposition businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Those with rifles here -LRB- the Defense Forces -RRB- or those with rifles over there -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-. The opposition has no weapons.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> forced <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> out on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, encouraged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, tried to dismiss the general. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office has brought the country to the brink of economic collapse. Shortly after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which provides the dollars <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses as its currency, withheld shipments of cash to the Panamanian central bank. Then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze all other Panamian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and stopped monthly payments for operations of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The result was a money crunch that left the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government unable to pay its employees in cash and forced banks to remain closed for the past 11 days. The government is working out barter deals with supermarkets in an attempt to overcome the crisis, but business has come to a standstill. `` Unless something happens soon, people will have to take to the streets to search for food,'' said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, managing editor of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, which the government closed down Feb. 25. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been hanging on thanks to the loyalty of his colleagues in the military's top ranks. Many of them, like himself, come from middle-class families. In office since 1983, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is ideologically and politically an heir to Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the officer who rode a crest of Panamanian nationalism and concluded the agreement that set a timetable for total Panamian control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> by the year 2000. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> uses <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the only armed authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the way a politican would use the party to whip up support in small towns where the soldiers build roads or perform other civic jobs. `` He has established a very close relationship _ even more than friendship _ between the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the people,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The political opposition here can not overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' The political opposition is made up of badly organized liberal parties whose leaders spend much time criticizing each other. The best organized party is the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because he was refused entry into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> two weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> led the opposition alliance in 1984 and refused to recognize the election results that put in <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> as president. They claimed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rigged the vote. It was the first election in 16 years in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The last popularly elected regime lasted 11 days in 1968. <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> was forced out, following a disagreement with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was then vice president, took his place. The next presidential elections are scheduled for May 1989.

 A star-studded AIDS benefit led by <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> raised $ 2 million for education and research, and organizers hope the gala will be repeated elsewhere. `` We've had the most private funds raised -LRB- for AIDS -RRB- at this one function than any other place in the country,'' benefit spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cinnamon </PERSON> said of Sunday's `` An Extraordinary Evening with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and Friends.'' `` We want it to be the prototype for the rest of the country.'' The series of $ 2,500-a-plate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> dinner parties fell short of its $ 3 million goal, although its `` grand finale'' of champagne and dessert at the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel was sold out. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> urged the crowd, which included <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Margaux </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON>, to do more. `` Go out there and get your next-door neighbor involved,'' she said. `` Put your money where your mouth is. `` We're talking about the living who are dying, and it's getting closer to all of us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, likening fear of the disease to the tenacles of an octopus. `` How do you cope with those families who reject their beloveds ... -LRB- AIDS victims -RRB- need compassion and understanding. People may say money ca n't buy compassion, but money can buy health.'' The fund-raiser featured a dozen black-tie parties from <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, all given in the homes of celebrities or community leaders. Before the finale swung into full force with a stream of stars in sparkling jewels and dresses filling the posh beachfront <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> received $ 1.1 million from <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` That's so much money ... I mean that's so incredibly much money and the things that money will do!'' said Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who became involved with AIDS issues in 1984, chairs the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a research and education group that will share the benefit's proceeds. `` Work at hospitals! Be volunteers! ... Your lives are not endangered,'' a teary-eyed Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told her guests. `` I have talked to, kissed and embraced and held in my arms, children, boys and girls, who have died in my arms and I'm still here.'' Besides the gift from Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, the total raised was boosted by a $ 300,000 donation by the <ORGANIZATION> Wohl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Community Alliance Against AIDS, a fund-raising arm of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, led the benefit and will share the proceeds with Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s group. Celebrities at the parties said they were pleased to join the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` It's really an honor for me to be here,'' actor <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. `` It's a real problem everywhere, not just in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but all over the world. Anything I can do to help is why I'm here.'' `` The truth is AIDS is a problem of all citizens,'' actor <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> said. `` I consider it a part of my selfish responsibility to be here. I'm not immune to this thing any more than anyone else.''

 Snow-clogged roads plagued motorists today from the eastern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states where road crews were digging out from the region's worst blizzard in decades. The storm fizzled as it moved east, but still left 1 -LCB- feet of snow on the ground this morning along the windy <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> and more than 20 inches in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` For all practical purposes, it just kind of died as it moved into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> out of lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, a forecaster with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` The only significant snowfall right now is near the lakes due to the lake effect,'' he said early today. Three sisters were killed Sunday evening south of <LOCATION> Waunakee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, when the car they were riding in collided with a pickup truck on a snow-slick road, authorities said. The accident brought to six the number of deaths blamed on the storm since it hit the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` We have been bombarded with accidents,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, a state trooper in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where expressways were glazed with ice Sunday night. `` It's very treacherous.'' <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had 80 weekend traffic accidents, and all but major roads remained blocked by snow even though crews were working 12-hour shifts, state police Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Numikoski </PERSON> said Sunday. Four inches of new snow was measured at <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base near <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>. South of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, a heavy snow warning was posted through today in northeast <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Cold Canadian air pushed south in the wake of the storm. High temperatures today were expected to be much colder than normal for the season from the lower Great Lakes to the central Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> coast, and as much as 30 degrees colder than usual in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys. The storm had closed long sections of major highways in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. The last interstate to be reopened was I-90 across western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, which was finally fully cleared late Saturday, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> engineer in <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At the worst of the storm about 260 miles of it was shut down. Fifteen-foot drifts were reported along I-90 in the <LOCATION> Kadoka </LOCATION> area, and <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> said snow had drifted to the top of overpasses. Crews in <LOCATION> Dawes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where more than 30 inches of snow fell in some areas, were having trouble breaking through snowdrifts up to 10 feet high, and some ranchers could n't reach their cattle, County Commissioner <PERSON> Waymann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wild </PERSON> said `` This is probably the worst we've had since 1949,'' he said. The county was hard-hit last year, `` but nothing like this.'' About 700 snowbound travelers who had crowded the small town of <LOCATION> Kimball </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, since Thursday were told Sunday that roads were still not in good shape but they could leave. To the north, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, hungry, snowbound skiers had to dig their cars out of 7 feet of snow to leave <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekeren </PERSON> said. Two busloads of children who had been snowbound in isolated farmhouses in western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> since Thursday got home safely Saturday afternoon. The 21 children were being driven home from school when the blizzard caught their drivers by surprise, forcing them to seek shelter with farm families. Four deaths in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> were blamed on the storm.

 Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> plans to deliver a speech on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> today that says the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is `` part of the problem'' in the guidance system for the MX missile, but the service maintains the weapon is reliable and accurate.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> closing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s observer mission at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would negatively affect American credibility and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in an hour-long <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> interview published today, also said the first casualty of the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to close the mission will be Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, speaking mostly in English, said in the interview Sunday that ouster of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is against international law. He also said it will teach every nation that they `` may face the same treatment if they have a difference of opinion between their country and the American administration.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader, wearing a military-style uniform and a winter hat, is in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> for a two-day meeting with President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, the newspaper said.

However, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted last week as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was `` fraught with danger'' and incapable of bringing peace to the region. `` The only word I agree with in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan is the name <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, according to an account Friday in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said in the interview that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was `` giving this hard line because he wants a high price from the American administration'' -LRB- and -RRB- `` the first item on the list has been offered already,'' referring to the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next will demand more weapons, more financial help and `` who knows, more agreements'' before conceding to talk about peace. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> were discussing the Algerian leader's call for a summit meeting of Arab nations on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace issue. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he expects the conference to be held the first week in April. Asked about <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, `` This is one of the most important positive signals in the Palestinian revolution. Grandfather, father, grandson _ all of them are in a revolution, and we are proud of them.''

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> opened their 29-city `` rat pack'' reunion tour to a sell-out crowd of 14,500, proving they can still doo-be-doo-be-do it with the best. `` How long have I been on?'' a staggering <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> asked the bandleader as the 35-piece orchestra warmed up for the first number, `` When You're Drinking,'' a parody of the old `` When You're Smiling. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s cocktail lounge manner and slurred one-liners, with trademark cigarette and drink in hand, set the tone for an evening that brought young and old fans to their feet. Sunday night's <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION> show was the first of 40 performances on the tour, which is expected to generate $ 20 million and a Home Box Office cable television special. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 70, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, 72, first appeared together at the Sands Hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, in January 1960. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> joked his way through sometimes sentimental versions of `` Everybody Loves Somebody -LRB- Sometime -RRB-,'' `` That's Amore,'' and `` Little Ole Wine Drinker Me.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> provided a powerful contrast to his seemingly sloshed co-star, winning applause when he announced that this is his 59th year in show business and when he told the audience he had been sober for the last three. `` I got ta tell you the truth. Everybody backstage is being very cool,'' he said. `` I was n't this scared when I lived at 147th Street and 8th Avenue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who recently underwent hip surgery, did not dance but won ovations for `` Candy Man,'' `` What Kind of Fool Am I?,'' and `` Bojangles.'' But it was <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> who stole the show, opening the second half with a string of the songs that have kept him in superstar ranks for almost a half century. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> fans, young and old, went wild as `` Old Blue Eyes'' belted out such favorites as `` What Now My Love?'' `` Maybe This Time,'' `` For Once in My Life,'' `` Mack The Knife'' and `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was then rejoined by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, `` As far as we're concerned, and I can say this for the two of us, you're still the chairman of the board.'' `` Yeah,'' quipped <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. `` You're still the chairman and we're still bored. The fans were n't bored, though. `` I saw <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> 15 years ago in <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and he's better than he's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaix </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> Her husband, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, added, `` I'm sorry we did n't buy tickets for our parents.'' <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pobuta </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, said she went through `` heck'' to get her tickets, which sold officially for as much as $ 40 but were being scalped for up to $ 300. `` I've loved <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ... I thought they looked great. For me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' `` I've been buying their albums since I was a teeny-booper _ since the 40s,'' said <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, who added `` there was no way'' she would have missed the Rat Pack performance. `` I will not drive without <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> in the tape player.'' The `` Rat Pack'' moniker, from <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, was given to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the late <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawford </PERSON> and other performers who lived in the same area of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> nearly three decades ago. The tour was born when the three longtime friends were gathered at <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s house, and became a reality because they are all under contract to the entertainment and casino company <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The three are among a growing number of aging superstars to rekindle their acts. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caeser </PERSON> recently made a television movie, `` Side by Side.'' <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahl </PERSON> have all been contracted for one-man shows. The `` Together Again'' tour continues in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, B.C., on Tuesday, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Friday and Saturday. Later stops include <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uniondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, plus cities in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Clarence Darrow Admirers Commemorate 50th Anniversay Of His Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Admirers of <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> marked the 50th anniversary of the death of `` the attorney of the damned'' by tossing a wreath into the lagoon where his ashes are scattered and pledging to live by his example. About 100 people huddled together against the snow Sunday on a bridge in a park on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s South Side. <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, a skeptic on matters of religion and the afterlife, said if there was anything to the spiritual world, he would return at 10 in the morning on each anniversary of his death, according to <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Despres </PERSON>, a former alderman of the 5th <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> lived. For years after <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>'s death, magicians and spiritualists gathered at the bridge to conjure up the lawyer's spirit _ but year after year they went away disappointed. Those gathered at the bridge departed with a renewed sense of commitment to the ideals <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> stood for: justice and equality. `` For those of you who question life after death ... <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> is here in spirit today as we commit ourselves to follow the example of his life,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. About a dozen attorneys, politicians, judges and ministers addressed the crowd in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a few blocks from <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>'s home In his 50 years as a lawyer, <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> defended `` the preconvicted, the powerless, those damned before they had a chance to have a fair trial,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Clarence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Darrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commemorative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. One of <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>'s most famous clients was <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> teacher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scopes </PERSON>, whom he aided in 1925 in what became known as the `` Monkey Trial.'' <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, defended the right for evolution to be taught in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> schools. Though Scopes was found guilty, his conviction was later reversed on a technicality. <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> also gained fame during the 1924 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> murder case of <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, millionaires' sons accused of the thrill killing of 14-year-old <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> persuaded them to plead guilty and saved them from death sentences. <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Kinsman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but spent most of his legal career in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, was one of the first to be called a labor lawyer. He resigned as the attorney for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> to represent labor's side of an 1893 railroad strike led by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Debs </PERSON>. For the past 31 years, the commemorative committee has marked <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>'s death on March 13, 1938, by throwing a wreath into the lagoon under the Darrow Bridge. `` <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> was and is a folk hero,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, who recently published a biography on the lawyer. `` He was always a defender of the damned and a defender of the unpopular.''

<HEAD>Disagreement Splits Jackson Campaign Effort In Northern Indiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A disagreement among supporters of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has split the Democrat's presidential campaign effort in northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> now has two campaign headquarters, both located in the same block of the same downtown street in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. And although the campaign workers in each office are working toward the same goal _ the election of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the May 3 primary _ they are functioning under different local campaign directors. The dispute boiled over late last week when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state coordinator, the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, appointed the Rev. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> as campaign coordinator for northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he made the appointment because the man named by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s national campaign office to head the northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> effort, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, had refused to communicate with <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and could not reach out to other elected officials and voters. `` I did not appoint him and I am not going to unappoint him. But I'm appointing someone to get some things done,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> no longer spoke for the local campaign. However, <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> insists that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has acted beyond his authority, and claims that he is the only authorized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> representative in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. Top officials of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign's national and state offices confirm that <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> is the authorized head of the campaign in the 1st Congressional District.

<HEAD>Reagan Labels `Pork' One Of Dukakis' Favorite Home Projects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has labeled federal funding for a planned biotechnology research park in central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> often points to while campaigning for president a prime example of waste. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> listed the $ 100,000 for the <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, project among $ 1.15 billion in `` pork'' he would have cut out if allowed to single-out projects from last year's massive congressional spending package. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides defended the center, which is part of the governor's `` Centers of Excellence'' program designed to develop technologies of the future like photovoltaics, polymers and biotechnology. `` The Centers of Excellence program is another example of an innovative experiment hatched at the state level,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>. `` For too long <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has turned its back on these innovative approaches.'' In his campaign speeches <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has praised the state-supported centers as places where `` the best minds of industry, government and academia are coming together to chart the frontiers of science and technology and spawn new industries and new opportunities for good jobs and economic growth.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has quietly disbanded the group it set up more than two years ago to sell the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's widely criticized policy towards <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, the most recent director of the <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> And </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said the office effectively closed at the end of 1987. The decision not to continue the office resulted in part because <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has waned as an issue attracting daily headlines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. `` By 1987 there were other issues,'' he said. `` There was the -LRB- Persian -RRB- Gulf, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in general, the controversy involving <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. The office, which at one point had a staff of about 20, was created in late 1985 as the administration pursued its policy of `` constructive engagement,'' _ attempting to pressure the white government in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> into eliminating racial segregation through diplomacy rather than sanctions. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ against the administration's will _ approved sanctions in 1986, thereby undercutting `` constructive engagement.'' House members are preparing to consider a measure later this month that would impose a full economic embargo on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said the working group did a good job explaining the department's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> policy. `` We got out the message ... People were much better informed in 1987 than in 1985.'' When the group was set up, it was never intended to be a permanent fixture, he said. He said the working group's staff traveled to over 45 states and gave more than 1,000 speeches to civic and business groups and met with reporters and editors from television stations and newspapers. The group was modeled after the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. That operation was also shut down.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Defy Government, Hold Protest Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Religious leaders who were barred from holding an anti-apartheid rally led more than 2,000 people in a defiant church service at a cathedral that was surrounded by police vehicles. `` The government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has signed its own death warrant,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. `` No government can challenge the living God and survive.'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>'s speech electrified a multiracial crowd at the Sunday service and was punctuated by shouts of `` Amandla!'' the Zulu word for `` power.'' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial separation, also spoke to the worshipers who packed the aisles of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s Anglican Cathedral. Organizers said many people trying to go to the service were turned back at police roadblocks on highways leading to central <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The church service was arranged after police prohibited a rally that had been planned at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. Police also banned the 5-day-old committee, whose members included <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, that was sponsoring the rally. The <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> service and others in major cities were called to protest government restrictions on opposition groups and the detention of thousands of people without charge during a 21-month national state of emergency. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> on Sunday warned the white-led government would `` take the necessary steps'' against clergymen who took up the cause of 18 black opposition groups banned in a crackdown last month. `` If teaching the gospel of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is going to lead me into trouble, tough luck,'' responded <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. Referring to <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s warning that clergymen should preach the `` true Christian message rather than revolution,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said: `` If you had read the Bible you would not have spoken such utter nonsense. ... The fight for justice is the Christian message.'' In another development, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> wrote an article in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> unless it meets three demands `` First, the state of emergency must be lifted,'' he wrote. `` Second, last month's restrictions against our peoples' organizations and leaders must be lifted Third, detainees ... must be tried in open courts or released.'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, who reported receiving two death threats in the past two weeks, told worshipers Sunday, `` It does not matter whether they ban us, threaten us, or kill us in jail _ the church of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has decided we have work to do. `` We must tell -LRB- President -RRB- P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, ` Your days are over,' `` he said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told the service, `` If it is revolution to say, ` I work for a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that is truly democratic, where black, white and yellow and green can walk together hand in hand,' then friends, I am for that.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s president has resigned, citing controversy over the $ 1.5 million renovation of his official residence, Eastcliff, and the $ 200,000 remodeling of his campus office suite. `` Over the past few weeks, you and I have lived with stories about Eastcliff renovations and repairs,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, president for three years, told a news conference Sunday night at the 55,000-student Big 10 school. `` The stories have not been good ones,'' he said. `` I bear a key responsibility for it. ... I am profoundly embarrassed and profoundly sorry for it.'' After repeated assertions recently that he planned to stay in office, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, 53, said he now believes he can not overcome the controversy. He said he was informing the university's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> he would step aside as soon as they arrange for an interim replacement. The regents never gave formal approval for the mansion renovation, which was orginally supposed to cost $ 400,000, a recent report by the legislative auditor's office said. The report said the involvement of <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> and his wife, university attorney <PERSON> Bonita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindelir </PERSON>, in the renovation led to some of the additional costs. Among the most embarrassing expenditures were those for a mahogany desk and credenza for <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s office that the legislative auditor said cost $ 17,445. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> has offered to pay for the office furniture. `` I have said recently that I thought I could learn from the mistakes of Eastcliff, improve the management of the university where it's needed, and get on with the important job of completing ` Commitment to Focus,''' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> told the news conference Sunday night. `` Commitment to Focus'' is <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s controversial $ 35.2 million plan to improve the quality of the university while reducing undergraduate enrollment. `` I have also said that if I felt my presence would hurt more than help in accomplishing that task I would step aside,'' he said, adding, `` As painful as it is for me to say, I now believe that to be the case.'' After he read a brief statement, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> left without responding to questions. Regent Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> were expected to comment on <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s announcement today, spokesmen said Sunday night. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, quoting sources it did not name in today's editions, said <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> met privately Sunday for about 90 minutes and that <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> had indicated before the meeting that he was prepared to ask <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> to step down. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> would confirm only that a meeting occurred. According to the newspaper's sources, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> was highly irritated when he learned last week that the university had amassed a reserve fund of more than $ 50 million. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s critics in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> called it a `` slush fund.'' Legislative auditors who revealed the existence of the $ 50 million fund said it was under the control of <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> and other top university officials and that some of the money was used on the house renovation without approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>. Spending on the mansion was revealed in news media reports in early February. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> then went to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on a vacation, angering lawmakers who thought he should have stayed available to answer questions about the remodeling. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native, came to the university in 1964 as an assistant professor in chemical engineering and materials science, and became a department head in 1979.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> fired long-range missiles into each other's capitals today as the so-called `` war of the cities'' flared again after a two-day lull. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said at least 20 people were killed in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. On the battlefield, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it attacked mountainous northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and downed an Iraqi warplane. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued shelling border towns. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said six rockets exploded in residential areas of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> today, killing at least 20 people and injuring 50. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired two missiles today into `` the dens of corruption'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the missiles were aimed at `` military and economic centers'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Radio, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said one Iranian missile crashed into a residential district of the city of 5 million around noon, killing some civilians. It gave no figures and made no mention of a second Iranian missile. The Iranian missile hit as oil and energy ministers from 20 Arab countries gathered in the capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for the opening of a four-day meeting on improving cooperation in energy and mineral resources. It was not known how far from the conference hall the missile exploded. The Iraqis say they have shot seven missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since Sunday to avenge Iranian shelling of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> towns over the weekend that killed at least 21 people and wounded 79. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian shellfire continued to hit the southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, the nearby city of <LOCATION> Qurnah </LOCATION> and the northern city of <LOCATION> Halbajah </LOCATION> today. It reported `` many civilians,'' including women and children, killed or wounded in a barrage that hit schools, houses and stores. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Revolutionary Guards launched a new assault in the northeastern <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> early today `` to avenge enemy missile attacks on residential areas.'' Quoting a military communique, the agency said the Iranians stormed Iraqi positions despite bad weather, inflicting `` heavy casualties'' and capturing several peaks in the Gerdhelkan range. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi warplane during the fighting as it attempted to strafe Iranian positions. It was the third Iranian assault in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported in 24 hours. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier that more than 800 Iraqis were killed or wounded in attacks in the <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khormal </LOCATION> regions on Sunday when its forces seized 15 square miles of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory and 12 `` strategic heights'' in the <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> area, 160 miles north of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqi news agency quoted a military communique as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes flew 141 combat missions against Iranian troop concentrations and other military targets Sunday. It said helicopter gunships flew 85 missions. <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported today that an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> naval force sank a `` large maritime target along with its occupants'' near the Iranian coast on Sunday night. It gave no other details. Sunday's missile attacks ended an unofficial two-day truce in the war of the cities. Hundreds of civilians were killed in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and other cities in both countries during a 12-day missile duel that had ended Friday. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is 290 miles from the border, while <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> is 85 miles away.

He was sentenced to death by a lower court last November. The Chinese government in January announced tough new rules for punishing economic crimes of corruption and bribery. The rules stated that those who gain more than $ 13,500 through corruption should be given prison terms of not less than 10 years, and serious offenders should be sentenced to death. There have been at least four reported cases this year of embezzlers being executed, usually by a bullet to the back of the head.

 High-level talks began today between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on a plan to end fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, officials said. The talks between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> and South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> `` Pik'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> are open-ended and no details will be released until they end, said <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s press secretary. It is the first meeting between the leaders in two years. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Crocker-Botha </LOCATION> meeting will provide an opportunity `` to reassess <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s willingness to proceed toward a settlement involving total <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and Namibian independence.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> also said the meeting would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a chance to `` register concern'' about recent developments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complained about anti-dissent measures in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the past few weeks.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Skiers Trapped By Avalanches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of skiers remained trapped in three Alpine ski resorts today after avalanches killed 10 people and injured at least 20 over the weekend. It was the worst winter-sport death toll for a single weekend in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in decades. Roads to the famed resorts of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>, Zuers and Stuben were snowed in for a third straight day, and high winds prevented helicopters from reaching the three high-altitude towns. Among those stranded in <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> were the former Dutch queen, Princess <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>, and her husband Prince <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>. `` They were supposed to leave on Saturday, but have been stuck here since then,'' said a receptionist reached by telephone at the Hotel Post, where the Dutch royalty were staying. `` But they are enjoying the winter sports and taking it all with good humor like everyone else here,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials said thousands of the skiers, most of them vacationing West Germans and Scandanavians, could remain stranded until Tuesday because of the heavy snows and continued danger of avalanches. `` It is possible roads will be opened this afternoon, but it is too early to tell,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumer </PERSON>, a local official, told Austrian radio. `` But it is too early to tell whether the danger -LRB- of avalanches -RRB- will drop enough,'' he added. The road to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION> was reopened today after seven people were killed and at least 20 injured in the resort town on Sunday. Five vacationing Swedish skiers and two Austrians were killed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION> early Sunday when two successive avalanches rolled down the steep mountains that tower above the resort and buried several chalets, authorities said. Three others were killed in separate avalanches on Saturday, bringing <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s weekend winter-sport death toll to 10. The accidents followed the death last weekend of a close friend of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who was killed in the Swiss resort of <LOCATION> Klosters </LOCATION> by a snowslide that narrowly missed <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. The avalanches destroyed four houses, damaged several other buildings and buried the only train tracks leading into the mountainous resort. <LOCATION> Innsbruck </LOCATION> police said authorities would not release the names of victims until their next of kin had been notified. The exact number of those injured in the incident was not clear, but several people were taken by helicopter to hospitals in <LOCATION> Innsbruck </LOCATION> and nearby Zams, according to a police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police said the single road that connects St. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> to the outside world remained closed, but that the train traffic to the resort had been resumed. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON>, set at 4,118 feet in the Arlberg region of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, is one of this Alpine nation's oldest and best-known ski resorts.

 Scattered shootouts and a bombing left four people dead and eight wounded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said today. Police identified the slain as two officers from the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, an officer of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla. In the latest violence, a Shiite Moslem attorney was critically wounded today when a time bomb exploded on a window ledge outside the bathroom of his west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> apartment as he was shaving, police said. <PERSON> Nimeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamieh </PERSON>, a former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was rushed to the <LOCATION> Barbir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> by neighbors, police said. They declined to speculate on the motive for the assassination attempt. The two Lebanese Forces officers were killed Sunday by bodyguards of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, in a quarrel in a traffic-jammed street in the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. Police said the shooting sharpened tension between the Lebanese Forces and <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia, which controls the <LOCATION> Metn </LOCATION> province in the Christian heartland northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The two sides have been vying for dominance of the Christian community, whose control of the government, army and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> triggered the civil war with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem majority that began in 1975. The Druse militia officer was killed Sunday evening in an ambush by militiamen of Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement in the <LOCATION> Rashaya </LOCATION> district in the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today began a five-day official visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a Communist nation suffering from high inflation and unemployment and a $ 20 billion foreign debt. The Soviet Communist Party general secretary, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, landed in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> in a special <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilyushin </ORGANIZATION> jet that flew directly from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s top party and government leaders were on hand at the airport to greet the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the first Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since the May, 1980 death of <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who pulled his nation out of the Soviet bloc in 1948 to pursue a non-aligned foreign policy and a once-vaunted system of worker self-management in the economy. That system looks increasingly frail as <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> battles 170 percent inflation and 15 percent unemployment and struggles to repay its foreign debt. Last year, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership faced unprecedented worker unrest, with more than 1,500 strikes adding to the traditional problems of keeping this ethnically diverse nation together. The system of self-management by which workers nominally run <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s enterprises will be one topic on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s agenda at meetings today with <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>'s Communist leaders, Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ilija </PERSON> <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> told reporters in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Sunday. Asked whether the Yugoslavs would discuss recent ethnic tension in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON> said this was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s internal affair `` and we shall certainly leave that to their own resources. He added, however, that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would have an opportunity to see for himself how <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a diverse nation of six republics and two autonomous regions, deals with ethnic, linguistic and economic differences. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for more openness on social problems and economic reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been called into question recently by mass demonstrations by Armenians in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At least 32 people died when ethnic tension between the largely Christian Armenians and their Moslem neighbors, the Azeris, boiled over into fighting in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> two weeks ago. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will not be visiting <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> region most plagued by ethnic tension between ethnic Albanians, and Serbian and Montenegrin minorities. But he will get a look at the economic diversity of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, visiting factories in the relatively flourishing northernmost republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubrovnik </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The visit to <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> may also give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a look at the way his country could develop if the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's three-year drive for more democracy under Communism gains further impetus. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has the most liberal newspapers of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s free-wheeling, state-controlled press, and young people there have emulated west European counterparts in pushing strongly for greater ecological concern, a ban on nuclear power and an end to compulsory military conscription

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman who was locked in a custody dispute with her former husband hired a team of retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commandos to get her daughter back from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, according to a published report. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was given custody of the girl by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court when she and her Jordanian husband divorced, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The husband abducted the girl, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, and took her to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Ms. <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON>, unable to get her daughter back through legal channnels, hired a firm of former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commandos to take the girl away from her father, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> claimed legal custody of the child under Jordanian law. Corporate Training Unlimited, a firm in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, specializing in `` hostage rescue training,'' plotted and carried out the seizure for expenses and a hefty, undisclosed fee, the newspaper said. Although company president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> denied the story, other well-placed sources described the company's role, the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said. Ms. <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON> now is in hiding with her 7-year-old daughter, while the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is fielding protests from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> about Americans' role in the dispute, the newspaper said. The rescue attempt began at 8:30 a.m. Jan. 28 in <LOCATION> Jerash </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, sources close to the participants told the newspaper. The abduction began when <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> hostage rescue specialist, hailed and stopped a school bus by waving a note in Arabic. While <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> pinned the shocked driver to his seat, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON> embraced her child and swept her off the bus, smacking a teacher who tried to block their escape. They fled in a white Datsun and switched cars before crossing the border into Israeli-controlled territory, the newspaper said. When his daughter first disappeared, <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> said she had been abducted by three Americans and published newspaper advertisements seeking information. <PERSON> Sameer </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> friend of <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON>'s, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the fall of 1987 after selling a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> restaurant called The Country Skillet. <PERSON> Bayan </PERSON> had legal custody of <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> under Jordanian law, <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said. The raid embarrassed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> because embassy officials knew about the operation but did not alert Jordanian authorities, the Inquirer reported. Jordanian authorities reached by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> said the girl left <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> legally because she had an American passport. <LOCATION> Jerash </LOCATION> police accused some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy officials of taking part in the operation, but police in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> denied the abduction incident took place. No State Department press official was available Sunday to comment on the report. There was no listing for Corporate Training Unlimited in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, and no listing for <PERSON> Mahoon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. According to a brochure obtained by the Inquirer, Corporate Training Unlimited, consists entirely of `` <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Special Operations qualified personnel.'' Its founders left the military in 1983 amid allegations that they had claimed expenses from both the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for guarding VIPs at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigators now want to know whether credentials issued to the company's founders while in the military were used in the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> incident, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks resumed today, one day before a Soviet-set target date for a settlement. There were unconfirmed reports <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was about to decide whether to sign an agreement with the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. `` We will announce something today,'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief representative, acting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, told reporters as he arrived for a new meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>. He did not elaborate. There was no confirmation of published reports quoting Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as saying his country will make a final decision today on whether to sign the proposed settlement. The head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, was scheduled to meet <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> today in keeping with the pattern of the talks held indirectly because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not recognize the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has been speaking for the guerrillas, which are excluded from the talks and do not formally recognize the U.N.-sponsored peace process. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last month that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would bring home its estimated 115,000 troops starting in mid-May if a settlement was signed March 15 _ Tuesday. But sources close to the negotiations have said they do not consider the date a rigid deadline. Soviet troops have been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, helping the government fight Moslem insurgents, since December 1979. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> seemed to make plain today that he expected the talks to continue for at least several more days. He said he wanted to ask <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> what the program would be `` for the next few days to finalize'' the peace package. `` They are a few points remaining'' before the settlement is ready for signature, he added. Details have not been published. The latest round began March 2 and is already the longest since the negotiations began nearly 6 years ago. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s negotiating position is jeopardized by a reported rift in the alliance of seven guerrilla groups over plans to send representatives to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> if a transitional government will replace the existing one. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> argues that only a broad-based government can oversee implementation of the agreements and ensure the safe return of more than 5 million Afghan refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have fiercely rejected that demand, saying the future government was something to be decided by the Afghans themselves and was not subject for discussion at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

 The bodies of three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members killed by British troops in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> were headed to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> today for funeral services and a possible St. Patrick's Day burial. Families members and a Roman Catholic bishop called for calm at the funerals of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members, who British authorities linked to a planned car bombing. Police on both sides of the border were expected to mount a huge security operation to prevent paramilitary displays beside the coffins during today's 100-mile journey by road to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, and at the funerals later this week. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, said a chartered plane carrying the bodies of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, was to fly today from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, the British fortress colony in southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The cortege was to travel directly from <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members will be buried in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> on Wednesday or on Saint <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Day on Thursday, when the funeral processions likely would be swollen by hundreds of sympathizers St. Patrick's Day, honoring <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s patron saint, is celebrated by Catholics across the island. <PERSON> Cahal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic whose diocese includes <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, said Sunday he hoped both police and mourners will display `` a desire to avoid confrontation.'' In a statement, the families of the three dead men appealed to the security forces `` to permit us the dignity to bury our loved ones in peace.'' The three guerrillas were unarmed when they were shot and killed March 6 by soldiers believed to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, an elite British regiment. The shootings triggered rioting in Catholic districts of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> for much of last week, and provoked protests that the three should instead have been arrested. The British government said the soldiers believed their lives were endangered. Two days after the shootings, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police discovered a car packed with 145 pounds of Czech-made explosives in <LOCATION> Marbella </LOCATION>, 30 miles from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the guerrillas intended to blow up the car during a military ceremony in the colony. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Since the political and sectarian violence erupted in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969, at least 2,628 people have been killed. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funerals have in recent years brought bloody clashes between nationalists and massed ranks of police seeking to prevent gunmen firing shots over the coffins, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional salute to its dead. The practice is banned.

 A man who parachuted from a 50-story downtown building is a member of a group that requires such jumps, police said. The parachutist dropped onto a car a week ago and fled before police could collar him. But since then, he was traced through the license number of a getaway car and identified as a Canadian, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The man, whose name <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> would not release, belongs to a group called Building, Antenna, Span and Earth club, or BASE. Members are required to parachute from a building, antenna, a bridge and a cliff or mountain. `` They do n't live long,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. `` It seems utterly crazy that someone needs that much excitement in their life.'' He said it was much safer to parachute from an airplane than from a fixed object. The officer said police traced the license number of the jumper's getaway car to a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> man, who admitted he helped in the escape. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> also refused to identify the accomplice. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he has not contacted the parachutist, who lives in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and is a truck driver. But his accomplice told police that the Canadian wants to reimburse the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Musiliu </PERSON> <PERSON> Alagbala </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, for the several hundred dollars worth of damage to the car, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alagbala </PERSON> said Sunday he was amazed and angered by the incident. `` I've seen things like that in the movies, but I'd never thought it would happen to me,'' he said. If the parachutist returns to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he may be charged with criminal trespass for being on the roof of the <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> Building without permission, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The suspect also may be charged with criminal damages for the dents in the car, he said. `` We are not going to extradict him.

Several <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> mayors have gone on to become president. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> is a rising star in the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and his election represents a setback for President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> was the only <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate for mayor in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The feuding <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> put up three candidates. Voters heeded <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s plea to fight bullets with ballots in the election, which was called as a concession to leftist guerrillas. For the past 169 years, the president, always from either the Liberal or Conservative parties, had appointed governors who in turn named mayors. There were 1,008 mayors elected Sunday. Colombians also elected city council, state assemblies and governing bodies for remote territories without sufficient population to become states. In the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> race, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caicedo </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businessmen </ORGANIZATION>, came in second place. With about 50 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> counted, <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> had 122,107 votes and <PERSON> Caicedo </PERSON> had 94,322, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release Sunday night. By late Sunday night the elections office said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had won 405 of the mayoral races, the Conservative Party 379 and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> 13. Coalition candidates representing several parties had won 104 mayoral posts, the elctions office said. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in a speech televised nationwide Saturday night, said voting would be a way to reject the wave of violence that has swept <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. More than 1,700 people were killed in the past year in fighting between leftist guerrillas and government security forces and by right-wing death squads and drug traffickers. On Sunday, soldiers and police guarded voting places and patrolled cities and towns. The campaign was one of the bloodiest ever in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, with leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads killing five mayoral candidates and 19 city council candidates. Hundreds of other political activists were slain. Leftist guerrillas kidnapped 14 mayors in the two weeks before the election. The rebels let them go after warning each to do more for the poor. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, who called for stronger action against the multibillion-dollar cocaine and marijuana trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was kidnapped by drug traffickers in January. A week later, police acting on a tip, raided a farmhouse where he was held. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> had not been harmed. Colombian officials sometimes pay with their lives for challenging drug traffickers, who are among the wealthiest men in the nation. One group, the <ORGANIZATION> Medillin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, is said to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with being one of its leaders. In 1984, Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> was killed, and in January Attorney General <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> was gunned down. Officials suspect drug traffickers in the deaths because both men fought narcotics.

 Convicted killer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> again faces execution this week after outlasting six death warrants and becoming a symbol of the national conflict over capital punishment. His appeal was pending today at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> in advance of a scheduled Tuesday morning execution at the state prison here. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, the only official outside the courts who could intervene, said last week he saw no reason to back off the death warrant he signed Tuesday. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was scheduled to die shortly after midnight for the murder of a <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> police officer 10 years ago. <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> had claimed he was suffering from post-war stress syndrome as a result of his experiences in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and asked for the death penalty at his trial, implying he would kill again. His lawyer, <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, refused to say if an appeal was being pursued. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> maintained his innocence in an interview published Sunday. `` If I'm executed Tuesday, it wo n't change the facts one bit,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` All that will happen is that I will be an innocent dead person instead of an innocent live person.'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said he's convinced his latest execution was scheduled with only seven days' notice `` to keep me from getting too much public attention. `` Since January, I have received close to 2,000 letters from around the world,'' he said in the interview. Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and the London-based human rights organization <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> are among those who have spoken out in support of <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. Backers have said he has been on death row for 14 years because of a racist legal system that denied him a fair trial. But police in three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties consider him a suspect in at least five killings in addition to the 1973 death of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turman </PERSON>, for which <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> received the death sentence. Those cases remain unsolved and <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> has never been charged in them. According to a report Sunday in The <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, police in <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> counties say <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> began his spree by beating a woman to death with his hands. Authorities say he then strangled a woman with her stocking, battered a woman to death with a tire iron and finally shoot his victims in the face with a short-barreled .38 - caliber revolver after they had been forced to perform oral sex on All the slayings police suspect <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> of occurred in 1973 while he was on furlough from <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, where he was serving a six month to 20 year sentence for breaking into the home of a 70-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> woman in 1968, beating her and attempting to rape her. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> has outlasted more death warrants than any other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> inmate, and has been on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row, the nation's largest, longer than all but one inmate. The dispute over his case centers on whether <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> has an alibi as a result of statements from a minister and a woman placing him away from the scene of the <PERSON> Turman </PERSON> killing. Law enforcement authorities say evidence shows the killing occurred an hour too late for <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> to have an alibi. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> was scheduled to die shortly after midnight CST. In 1978, after being picked up on a drunkeness charge, <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> pulled a gun as he sat in the back seat of a police car and fired it into the back of the driver, police officer <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>. As part of his defense, he claimed he was suffering from post war stress and exposure to Agent Orange. In his appeals he also claimed he had inadequate defense counsel during his trial. Gov.-elect <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who was to take office this afternoon, said he had no plans to stop the execution. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, warden of the state penitentiary at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Felde </PERSON>'s sisters visited with him Sunday and would be back at the death house today where the execution will take place. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Felde </PERSON> has asked for pizza, fried shrimp and ginger ale for his final meal.

 Pro-Iranian militants marking the third anniversary of a car bombing that killed more than 80 Shiite Moslems have threatened to launch new terrorist attacks against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We should not forget that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is behind all the massacres and crimes,'' said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, a senior official of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, at a mass rally in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> district on Sunday.

 A robbery suspect who claimed he had AIDS and threatened to bite the first police officer that came near him was put into a patrol car alone and towed to a police station, a department spokesman said today. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was taken out of the patrol car by <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> personel wearing protective gear, said Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 27, was taken to <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for psychiatric evaluation and was classified as emotionally disturbed, he said.

<HEAD>Tourist Brochure That Punctured Robin Hood Legend Is Withdrawn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> fans have put an end to a tourism brochure that says their hero and Maid <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> never met, good-natured Little <PERSON> John </PERSON> was a grouch, and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> may have stolen from the rich just to line to his own pockets. `` I would like to see the authors of this brochure locked in the dungeons of <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>,'' said the sheriff of <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, on Sunday. Legend says <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, the medieval bandit who supposedly stole from the rich to give to the poor, repeatedly outwitted Young's ancient predecessor. Howls of protest from <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> fans and deflated tourism boosters led city officials to withdraw the glossy 45-cent brochure. It had been compliled by historians and published by the city council for distribution at a tourist information center. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Robin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, who took up the cudgels on the outlaw's behalf, charged: `` The city fathers have done a disservice to their own city.'' <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said he did n't claim that the story, as perpetuated by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, was true. He said he simply objected to being robbed of a legend that also brings tourist riches to <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>. The brochure took a skeptical academic line on the outlaw who, according to legend, lived in <LOCATION> Sherwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> with his merry band of men in the 12th century. City council spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the brochure put <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> `` in historical context.'' The brochure said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, in the earliest tales, was a highwayman who robbed travelers in neighboring <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>. He was in business strictly for himself. The brochure also says <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>'s true love, Maid <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, was introduced into the legend through a 13th-century French poem, and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>'s rotund lieutenant, <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, was probably an amalgam of two characters from different parts of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Nottingham, a city of 290,000 in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, can hardly be accused of neglecting the legend. Its main beltway is called Maid <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON>, and two rival consortiums are planning <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> exhibition centers for the city. In addition, hordes of tourists annually visit the <LOCATION> Sherwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, where they see displays of medieval lifestyles and gaze at the oak tree where the merry men may or may not have relaxed after a hard day's archery.

 Speakers were heckled with shouts of `` Nazi'' and `` traitor'' and shoving matches broke out as rival factions of American Jews clashed during a rally to support a peace plan for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories. Actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was escorted from Sunday's <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> rally by police after hecklers shouted him down as he tried to speak in favor of a peaceful solution to clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Other speakers included feminist <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, daughter of the late Israeli Gen. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, and several rabbis.

<TEXT>
 Millions of Chinese peasants have hit the road in recent weeks to seek their fortunes, creating a transportation crisis along the country's railways, an official report said. Armed police have been called out to maintain order at railway stations heaving under the mass of travelers while some passenger trains are carrying more than twice their capacity, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in an article appearing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Monday `` Some are going to the northwest for construction, some are going to the northeast's Daxinganling forest for lumbering, others are going <LOCATION> Gaungdong </LOCATION> province -LRB- in the south -RRB- to farm and still others are going to large cities as housekeepers,'' the news service said. At the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> station, the report said, `` people can be found everywhere sleeping in the open.'' In <LOCATION> Zhengzhou </LOCATION>, the capital of central <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province and a railroad hub, more than 10,000 people were said to be waiting at the station for tickets. The news service recounted the woeful tale of one passenger who stood for more than 30 hours on a train trip from <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province to the far-north city of <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>. At one point he lifted his swollen foot only to find the tiny space immediately seized by a traveler squeezed next to him. Nearly 4 million people ride the rails daily, the report said, without saying how much of an increase that represents. Most of the travelers are peasants looking for work, the report said. The exodus from rural homes began with the arrival of warmer weather following last month's Lunar New Year holiday. Poor peasants always have sought their fortune in big cities, but the situation has become a problem in recent years because of recent economic reforms that ease travel restrictions and permit labor markets. The railroad situation hits its most critical on the third, sixth and ninth days of each month, which are considered propitious days for travel, the news agency said. Although authorities are taking several steps to ease the situation, such as increasing passenger trains, the transportation crisis is expected to continue, the report said. In an earlier report, <ORGANIZATION> Sichuan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said March 2 that 100,000 travelers were trying to leave <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, the capital of central <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, every day for their hometowns, by rail. `` A few passengers, heedless of admonitions, have stormed their way onto the trains by breaking the windows,'' the report said. `` At the same time, trains leaving <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> station for destinations outside <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> are seriously overloaded to the extend that it is impossible to open the doors or supply drinking water.''

 A zoo polar bear injured a man with a history of mental problems who entered its cage, and police shot the bear to death, authorities say. The 28-year-old man, whose identity was not released, was treated at a hospital for a gash on his head and was put under emergency detention by police after the Sunday morning incident. Police said it was unclear why the man climbed into the bear's cage, but that the man told doctors he did it to `` give his brother strength,'' and that people `` need a show of courage. The `` brother'' reference was unexplained. Vilas Zoo director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the intruder had to scale a wall or climb through a moat to reach the the 7-foot-4, 900-pound bear, named Chief. `` I'd say it's a one in a million chance that you get out of a polar bear's den alive when a polar bear is in it,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. A jogger who heard shouts flagged down a motorist, who alerted police. The jogger, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 47, said the `` bear was standing above the person, licking him, playing around with him. The man was n't screaming. He was n't doing anything. I thought he was dead.'' Police Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Puls </PERSON> fatally wounded the bear with a 12-gauge shotgun after yelling at it and firing shots in the air in an attempt to scare it. <PERSON> Puls </PERSON> said he shot the animal after it began to drag the man to its cave. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said Chief, the only polar bear at the municipal zoo, was considered one of the largest in captivity. It had been with the zoo for about 13 -LCB- years. `` He was a good show and everyone liked him,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` But you ca n't compare his to a human life. All of us in the zoo profession know that a human life takes precedent.'' Police said the Sunday incident was the third time this year that emergency detention procedures had to be used to detain the man. Those procedures are used when a person is considered a danger to themselves or others.

<HEAD>Israel, Hungary Restore Low-Level Diplomatic Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened diplomatic offices in each other's countries today, but a Hungarian official said full ties await resolution of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is n't a superpower and therefore her ability to negotiate in the dispute is modest,'' visiting <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Jeno </PERSON> <PERSON> Jyenis </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` But we support all efforts to promote a solution to the conflict,'' he said. `` The restoration of full diplomatic ties between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> depends on a resolution of the conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Palestinians.'' The renewal of diplomatic links between the two countries comes 20 years after all Soviet bloc countries except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest its occupation of land in the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> became the first East bloc country to renew low-level ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last October. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also re-established direct diplomatic contacts with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and sent a consular delegation there in July. To promote the new ties between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an Israeli interest section office was opened in the Swiss Consulate in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, and a Hungarian interest section was opened in the Swedish Consulate in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. In 1986, trade between the two countries equaled $ 22 million, according to Israeli figures. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> sells <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> money, jam and furniture, while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exports light bulbs and phosphate to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In addition, about 15,000 Israeli tourists visited <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> last year, while about 2,000 Hungarians visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to Israeli figures.

It was a state monument for many years and became part of Salinas National Monument in 1981. <PERSON> Sisneros </PERSON> was the mission's caretaker while <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> was a state monument and was named a ranger when it became part of the national park system. `` It'll always be Abo on paper, but to the ones who worked with him, it'll always be ` <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>'s Place,''' said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> chief ranger <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulfer </PERSON>. `` His father had told him to take care of the mission. It was more or less a legacy given down to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> to take care of Abo.'' <PERSON> Fulfer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sisneros </PERSON> worked for many years `` for hardly any wages at all.'' `` <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> was the type of fellow that the love of the site outweighed the importance of money,'' he said. <PERSON> Sisneros </PERSON> was born in 1894 in a house near the Indian ruins at the Abo mission.

<HEAD>Senator, Counsel Say No `Bombshell' Likely From McFarlane
Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Iran-Contra committee and its chief counsel said today they doubt any `` bombshell'' implicating Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will emerge from the testimony of former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. Nevertheless, Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and counsel <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said they feel the arrangement was correct that led to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s plea of guilty on Friday to misdemeanor charges that he nad misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, interviewed on the `` CBS This Morning'' program, said they expect <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s testimony will be helpful in the prosecution and indictment of others involved in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contra rebels fighting the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said Sunday that even though he has promised to cooperate with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, he is unable to provide any new information. `` In saying I expect to testify, it's neither for nor against really anyone,'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` It's to say what I've already said on the record and there's nothing new that I know of to change what's there. And as far as I know that's all there is.'' Asked why <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would want him, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> responded: `` I suppose that he wants to hold everyone who did something wrong accountable and he's ceratainly done that with me, but it is n't a matter of being able to embellish what I've already said.'' But both men say they think Indepedent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> made the right decision to allow <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to plead guilty to lesser charges than committing perjury to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Interviewed today, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said, `` I think that the <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> plea was an obstacle to be cleared by the independent counsel and I would expect him to take other action soon.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, although saying he agreed that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s testimony is not likely to produce new information, said that `` his testimony will be useful, I believe, according to the special prosecdutor, in testifying in any future trials that may occur.' `` I think Judge <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> really was not seeking so much his cooperation as the principle that there was no justification for lying to or misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Iran-Contra affair,'' added <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the four counts by falsely assuring lawmakers that members of his staff, specifically Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, had not been involved in private efforts to arm the Nicarguan rebels during a statutory ban on direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras. Each of the four counts carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. As part of the plea agreement, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s inquiry into the secret sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contras. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who resigned as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser in December 1985, traveled to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in May 1986 with North on a mission to deliver spare missile parts and persuade <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials to help obtain the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The grand jury that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> impaneled 14 months ago is preparing to return indictments in the next several weeks.

 South African military forces will not leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops also depart, according to a report in today's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. The South African forces will remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until the 40,000-member Cuban force departs, South African President <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in an interview with <PERSON> Arnaud </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchgrave </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editor. In the past, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said its forces were operating in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in order to keep guerrillas out of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a South African controlled area adjacent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the article noted. Angolan officials, meanwhile, have reportedly given the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a timetable for withdrawl of the Cuban troops, but made that pullout conditional on departure of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchgrave </PERSON> that he has reasons to believe that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ready to cut its losses in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and is pressuring <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces. Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> believes his predecessors miscalculated the chances for revolution in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. Now, he said, the Soviets are anxious to cut down on the high cost of arming and propping up poor nations. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said that he does n't think the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to `` ditch'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, but rather is `` shopping for a compromise.'' If he is a wise man, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he will take this opportunity to get out of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seems to be playing domestic politics with the economic sanctions it has imposed on his country.

 A 7-year-old Canadian girl who shares a birthday with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has learned from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president that several other important people in history also were born in February. `` It was wonderful to learn that you and I share a mutual birthday,'' reads a typewritten letter signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Kaliopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Triantafyllakis </PERSON>. `` February is also the month in which <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> were born. I hope you make it a part of your birthday to learn more about these two great presidents who played such important roles in shaping our nation,'' the letter said.

The <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> response received Friday also included a glossy photo of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, and a 32-page booklet about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years in the White House. <PERSON> Kaliopi </PERSON> said she first heard a couple of years ago that she and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was born in 1911 in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, shared the same birthday. `` Actually, I think it was very nice of him to take the time to write her a letter,'' said <LOCATION> Kaliopi </LOCATION>'s mother, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>. `` Oh Mom,'' injected the youngster, `` he did n't write it, his secretary did.''

 The army said soldiers shot and wounded seven Arabs in a clash today, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents said troops closed one of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest food markets as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stepped up economic sanctions against the occupied territories. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said 150 Arab policemen in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> announced their intention to quit, joining hundreds of officers who have turned in their badges in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Israeli authorities acknowledged some resignations but gave no number. The resignations followed the slaying of a <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> policeman who was accused of collaborating with the Israelis. Undergound PLO leaflets have demanded Arabs stop working for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation authorities. Scores of tax collectors resigned earlier. An army spokeswoman said a violent demonstration took place in <LOCATION> Yamoun </LOCATION>, six miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. She said soldiers fired at the legs of demonstrators because the troops believed their lives were in danger. Seven Arabs were wounded and the village was placed under curfew, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported 12 Arabs were shot in clashes with soldiers, 10 in <LOCATION> Yamoun </LOCATION> and two others in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. Hospital officials declined comment, citing a newly enforced army ban on speaking to reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says at least 91 Palestinians have been killed since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories. In apparent response to the resignation campaign, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> continued its economic sanctions, including a ban on the shipment of gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakak </PERSON> of the Israeli-owned <ORGANIZATION> Padesco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies fuel to 50 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> gas stations, said drivers were afraid to make deliveries after two tank trucks had been attacked and burned. `` A truck carrying 20,000 liters -LRB- 5,000 gallons -RRB- of oil is like a napalm bomb. The drivers are afraid to travel,'' he said. Soldiers closed the regional fruit and vegetable market in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, 22 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Arab merchants said 70 trucks carrying tomatoes, peppers, cauliflower, lemons, oranges and apples were turned away. `` We started to sell about 8 a.m. when the soldiers came and forced us to close,'' said one merchant, who was sitting next to crates of fruit covered with tarpaulins and carpets. The merchant said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> farmers drove to other areas of town and tried to set up informal markets. But he said soldiers chased them away. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political science professor who lives in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities wanted to break the back of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> strike with economic pressure. `` The military government is trying to tell the people who is boss. They want to hurt the people economically. <PERSON> Jericho </PERSON> is an agricultural city. To order the market closed in the morning amounts to killing it economically,'' said <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>. A senior official in the army-run territorial government said there had been a `` shift in focus'' from the disturbances in the streets to civil disobedience. `` In this context, maybe we are going to take some steps -LRB- in response -RRB- to the economic steps they take,'' added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity A dozen heads of Arab chambers of commerce from throughout the occupied territories met in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. They called for a halt to `` all methods of collective punishment and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the cities and population centers.'' They also demanded an end to `` attacks on shopowners and their shops.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official who insisted on anonymity said the ban on fuels means <PERSON> Palestinianss </PERSON> will have difficulty restocking their heating tanks, that bakeries will have trouble baking bread and that farmers will not have fuel for the irrigation pumps. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for an eight-day visit and said he is `` always open to new and constructive proposals,'' to bring peace to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan for the region, said he will give the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration a qualified reply to the American proposal to hold peace talks by May 1.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said today he is `` always open to new and constructive proposals'' to bring peace to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to base negotiations on the 1978 Camp David agreements. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, arriving on an overnight flight from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, indicated in his statement at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> that he will give the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration a qualified reply to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to hold peace talks by May 1. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> escorted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to his hotel in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and talked with him for a half-hour over coffee. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is making a similar courtesy call later in the day. In his arrival statement, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appealed for understanding. `` In our search for peace,'' he said, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has always been helpful, open and indispensable.'' He said `` violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the area `` is littered with broken agreements.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the Camp David agreement, which led to a peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979 but failed to resolve the Palestinian issue, `` should serve as our guide'' in the current search for a negotiating formula. He said if past accords were ignored `` future agreements will be meaningless.'' The Camp David agreement called for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians did not participate in the talks, which ended in failure in 1981. Under that agreement, a temporary arrangement would last five years, setting the stage for negotiations on an overall Arab-Israeli settlement in which all options, including statehood, would be open. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has proposed a three-year interim arrangement, with the final negotiations to begin by the end of this year. `` We are always open to new and constructive proposdals, with our positive reaction to your useful ideas,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told his American hosts. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader made no mention of the international peace conference <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also proposed. His statement suggested he will attempt, during four days of talks here, to persuade <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to make some changes in the proposal <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also has presented to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should relinquish at least some of the land it captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day War in exchange for Arab recognition. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is committed to Palestinian autonomy under the 1978 Camp David agreement signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but he is reluctant to cede the lands on which 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs live under Israeli control. Before leaving for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Sunday that he would not call for a government vote until after his trip. `` After I come back with a summation of my talks with representatives of the American government, the Cabinet will meet immediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Israeli radio. `` It's a matter of about a week.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last week to consider the `` ticking demographic time bomb'' of the rapidly growing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population. At a congressional hearing, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had much to gain by territorial compromise. He did not say who would take over the land _ the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from 1950 to 1967. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> held <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> during the same period. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, designated by the Arab countries as the Palestinians' sole legitimate representative, has vowed to dismantle <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Jewish state. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> planned separate courtesy calls today on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> after his overnight flight from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The tough bargaining begins Tuesday with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and continues Wednesday with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House. The trip was planned before Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> began staging protest demonstrations. As of Sunday, 91 had been killed in three months of bloody clashes with Israeli forces. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in January offering to grant Palestinians living in the territories self-rule on all matters except security and foreign affairs. In a letter last week to critical <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> reaffirmed his commitment to the Camp David formula. It provides for negotiations on an overall settlement after five years of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> autonomy. All options, including statehood, would be open. `` We have sought peace relentlessly, but our Arab neighbors, except <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, still have to prove in deeds that they are willing to negotiate peace with us,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> proposed his plan for negotiations to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, to King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, and to Presidents <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. So far, none of the governments has responded formally. However, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted last week as saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was `` fraught with danger'' and incapable of bring peace to the region. `` The only word I agree with in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan is the name <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, according to an account Friday in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has requested a decision by all sides by about mid-March. His `` deadline'' coincided with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit. Israelis supporting and opposing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan staged separate demonstrations over the weekend, with an estimated 40,000 turning out to back the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposal and some 200,000 demonstrating against it.

Republicans had argued that <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, who leads public opinion polls in the governor's race, lost his <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> residency when he moved to the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to work for the law firm of <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartson </PERSON>. But <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> always intended to return to his home state and never established formal residence elsewhere. `` Personal presence -LRB- away -RRB- from one's place of domicile is insufficient to change one's domicile,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote. `` One must move to another place with the intent to make it his home and without the intention of returning to his home as such.'' The judge's decision came after a one-day trial Friday on <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that he meets the constitutional requirement to be governor <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> filed the suit in February after Republican Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> instructed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP-controlled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s eligibility. The election board last week delayed its probe to allow the court to rule. The election board and <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> already have called for any lower court decision to be appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> repeatedly expressed his intent to return to his home state and considered his stint in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as only a brief episode of professional development. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, the son of former Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, voted regularly in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and kept his ties to the state Democratic organization. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, 32, faces opposition from former <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>.

 Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today the days of brokered conventions `` are gone forever'' as he made his final plea to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters to abandon favorite son <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and vote for him. `` The politics of smoke-filled rooms and selected leaders deciding who our nominee is going to be went out years ago,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said on a final day of campaigning before Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor did not mention <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> by name, but his reference was unmistakable. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, short on cash and far behind in the chase for delegates to the Democratic National Convention, says he is running in his home state to play a role at a brokered convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to answer directly when a reporter asked him at an early-morning news conference whether a vote for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was a vote for a brokered convention. He replied by saying he hoped the voters would pick the candidate they believed would make the best Democratic nominee. He also said he could n't think of `` anything worse for our party than to go through weeks and weeks'' after the end of the primary season `` with speculation as to who's dealing with whom, who's negotiating with whom. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters he believes he has made `` significant gains'' in recent days in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Public opinion polls indicate that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support has begun to slip with another favorite son, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, challenging him for the lead and with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gaining support as well. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides, speaking privately, say they would be pleased if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> edged out <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> for a popular-vote victory, hoping that would persuade the senator to quit his campaign. In the separate election for 187 delegates, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides concede he is unlikely to win more than a handful in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, if that. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his comments at a news conference on a cold and windy elevated commuter railroad station. The governor, who prides himself on riding the subway to his statehouse office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, greeted commuters and chatted with railroad employees during a 20-minute train ride. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made these same arguments on Sunday. `` This nomination is not going to be decided by six guys sitting in a back room in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said as he polished off a day of ethnic campaigning at a fund-raiser in a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> restaurant. His comments were a variation on his made-for-Illinois television ad which lashes out against a brokered convention. The ad does n't mention <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> by name but the reference is clear, since the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator skipped the 21 Super Tuesday contests last week and says he is remaining in the race so he can participate in a brokered convention. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor set out on his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> stretch run as polls offered conflicting evidence on the race. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll published today in the newspaper gave <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the lead with 39 percent support, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 34 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 17 percent. But a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll for publication today gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 32 percent support compared with 29 percent for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and 20 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Those results suggested that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s support has begun to slip and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have begun to edge up. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the leader in delegates in the Democratic nomination race. His strategy in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> has been to suggest that he has the best chance to win the nomination and a vote for the favorite sons would lead to a brokered convention this summer. `` Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back to the days when the voters did n't really pick their nominee,'' says the announcer in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' television commercial. `` They say you must turn over that power to them at a brokered convention.''

<HEAD>Durango Flight Used Special Approach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> plane that crashed near <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> on Jan. 19, killing nine, was flying a time-saving airport approach over rough terrain that only can be used with federal permission, a safety board official said. The flight pattern is one of many possible causes being considered for the crash, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We've already looked at the approach,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. `` We've ruled nothing out It's one of the many pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.'' The special approach procedure took the aircraft toward the airport from the northeast, rather than from the southwest as other airlines approach, <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Airport Manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dent </PERSON> said the approach takes the plane over slightly rougher terrain but saves about 15 to 20 minutes per flight. `` In this case, their legs from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> would be reduced 30 to 40 miles, saving them quite a bit of flight time, fuel, etc.,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laschinger </PERSON> said in a copyright story broadcast Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> KMGH-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Dent said the northeast approach is not published in flight manuals and it is illegal for pilots to use the pattern without <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. <ORGANIZATION> KMGH-TV </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Minshall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trans-Colorado </PERSON> has had permission to use the special approach at <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> for a couple of years. He said representatives of Trans-Colorado and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment about the report. Soon after the crash, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and American West airlines applied for and received permission to fly the landing approach used by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dent </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said investigators plan to compare that landing pattern with the southwest approach. `` We'll be asking how this pattern differs from the other, if there's anything in this approach that could be a problem and how long Trans-Colorado has been flying it,'' he said. Trans-Colorado leases planes and crews to <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that operates in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> Flight 2286, carrying 17 people, had been given clearance to land at the Durango-La <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when it crashed 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>. The pilot, co-pilot and seven passengers died. Many of the eight passengers who survived waded through waist-deep snow to get help. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> released a toxicology report Friday showing that pilot <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> had a small amount of cocaine in his bloodstream and urine when he died in the crash. Dr. <PERSON> Merrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Birky </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> chemist at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the significance of the finding.

<HEAD>Iran Forced To Import More Oil Products After Air Raids, Survey
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been forced to sharply increase imports of refined petroleum products because <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids have badly damaged some of its refineries, the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The attacks also have forced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to ration gasoline for the first time. The weekly oil industry newsletter said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Laripax company chartered the 284,298-ton Liberian supertanker Patria to carry 1.8 million barrels of gas oil to the Iranian port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. It said two shipments totalling 900,000 barrels of gas oil were delivered to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> earlier this month. Gas oil, a refined fuel heavier than kerosene, is often used as a diesel fuel. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a major oil producer, has been importing around 300,000 barrels a day of refined products for 18 months because <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air strikes have reduced its refining capacity. The newsletter said that a big refinery on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts was badly damaged in an Iraqi air raid Feb. 27 and its output of 220,000 barrels a day curtailed. That attack triggered a renewed `` war of the cities'' between the two countries, at war for 7 -LCB- years, with both sides lobbing long-range missiles into each other capitals. The survey said another refinery in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> was only working at around half its normal capacity of 80,000 barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining capacity of around 1.3 million barrels a day is believed to have been slashed by as much as 66 percent since the war began. The Iraqi air force has been concentrating on hitting Iranian oil industry targets, the mainstay of its economy, since 1984. The newsletter estimated that despite these attacks, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is producing around 1.9 million barrels a day and exporting around 1.5 million barrels a day through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Industry sources said the Iranians are driving to expand their refining capacity. The <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> plant has been upgraded to a capacity of 280,000 barrels a day. The Iranians also are moving ahead with plans to build new plants at <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> on the gulf coast. They would have a combined capacity of more than 250,000 barrels a day that would restore <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining self-sufficiency. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s domestic consumption is estimated at around 700,000 barrels a day.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, about even with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in new <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> polls, said today `` I have to win and I will win'' in Tuesday's home-state primary. The Republican contest was looking like another <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> runaway. One poll out today said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was pulling ahead of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the battle of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> favorite sons, while another showed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> maintaining his advantage. But the percentages separating them were within the polls' potential margins of sampling error. Both showed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in third place, trying to cut into the home state support of his two <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals and claim some of the state's 187 Democratic delegates. A poll published today in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said 32 percent of likely Democratic voters supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 29 percent backed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and 20 percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had the backing of 4 percent. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed 500 likely voters on Friday and Saturday and had a margin of error of 5 percentage points. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday and published today in the newspaper, gave <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the lead with 39 percent support to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 34 percent among very likely Democratic voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 17 percent with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> far behind. The potential sampling error was plus or minus 6 percentage points. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is counting heavily on a victory on Tuesday, said as he campaigned at a commuter-train stop today that he had to win. `` A strong second is n't very strong,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also campaigning in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said today that the days of brokered conventions `` are gone forever.'' He was making his final plea to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters to abandon <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and support his own presidential bid. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> greeted workers during a shift change at a factory in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and said, `` I think we're going to do better than people expect here.'' Barring a major upset, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to pick up the lion's share of the 92 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake on Tuesday and deliver another blow to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s fading candidacy The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the choice of 62 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters, compared to just 28 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. As it became more apparent that the vice president was locking up his party's presidential nomination, he became the target of more criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic rivals. `` He certainly has a lot of baggage,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'd like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to tell us whether -LRB- Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was on his payroll when he was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. In a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> focused on the Iran-Contra affair and said, `` We still do n't know what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role was.'' Presidential politicking was picking up in two other states. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was holding a rally in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which holds Democratic caucuses on March 26 to choose 138 convention delegates. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> all were in the state over the weekend. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> by Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> who said: `` I am not endorsing anybody but I intend to vote for Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Young was one of the few black elected officials not allied with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, Democrats began a two-week process of selecting delegates to a state convention in April at which national convention delegates will be allocated. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the big winner Saturday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Democratic caucuses He received 54 percent of the vote and 23 delegates. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> got 18 percent of the vote and six delegates, while 15 others will be uncommitted. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 460 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 423 are the leaders in the Democratic delegate race, according to The Associated Press tally. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he was being hurt by the lack of money to buy television time. `` Obviously, not to have paid media hampers me in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said as he campaigned in the city's <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` But the only way I could have paid media would be to use up the resources and obligate the matching funds that are coming.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> insists that no Democrat will have the nomination in hand when the party convention convenes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July and that he will have as good a chance as anyone to come out a winner at a brokered convention. `` I think the notion of a brokered convention would be an absolute disaster,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during a campaign stop in a Hispanic neighborhood in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't imagine anything worse _ the idea of taking the right of the people to elect their president with their votes and putting it in some back rooms in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> fired back that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was showing `` a touch of arrogance.'' He said, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> has been wrong on other things and he's certainly wrong on that. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was interviewed on the CBS show, `` Face the Nation,'' and said that regardless of the outcome in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> he would continue his campaign. `` Sooner or later, the voters in one of these states are going to say, wait a minute, we're about to nominate a candidate who ca n't win in November,'' he said.

 I. King <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said today his appointment as the first hearing-impaired president of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only liberal arts college for the deaf, is a victory for students and the deaf community across the country. `` What it means to the students, it means to the deaf community at large and that's _ it opens up new horizons for deaf people,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, dean of the school's college of arts and sciences, was selected by <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> trustees on Sunday after what began as an isolated campus protest last week turned into an international forum on deaf rights. Students had sought a deaf leader to serve as the school's eighth president, but last week the board of trustees selected <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, a hearing woman who did not know sign language A week of protests shut down the campus as students called for the appointment of a deaf president and the resignation of board of trustees Chairwoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON>, who had come under fire for her handling of the crisis. Sunday night, seven days after their protest began, the students were victorious on both counts. Officials announced the appointment of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, 44, to replace <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, who resigned Friday, and the resignation of <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON>, who also hears normally and had chaired the board for six years. She will be replaced by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, one of four deaf members of the board. `` I took this step willingly,'' <PERSON> Spilman </PERSON> said. `` In the minds of some, I've become an obstacle to the future of the university. I am removing that obstacle.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who had endorsed <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>'s presidency at mid-week but later retracted his backing, today praised the students' efforts. `` I think that they really honestly believe that they were motivated in a positive way to do positive things, and the outcome has been very positive,'' said the new president. `` It's our responsibility now as administrators, me and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, to make sure we channel that energy in a positive way.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who also appeared on `` CBS This Morning,'' said the students realize `` this was something very special. There's not going to be an opportunity for this kind of movement again.'' `` The battle cry was, ` deaf president now;' it has become, ` deaf president forever,''' he said. Student protest leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Covell </PERSON> said Sunday that the demonstrators' actions mark `` the first time we've ever shown the world what we want, and that we can get it.'' `` God made the world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giansanti </PERSON>, a deaf chemistry professor, after the decision was announced. <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> said the board would form a task force to study its own composition in reponse to student demands that deaf people comprise a majority of the 20-member panel. There also will be no reprisals against student protesters, <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>, which offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in 30 fields, receives 75 percent of its $ 76 million budget in federal funds. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee plans to conduct hearings Tuesday into the school's bylaws governing presidential selection and composition of the board. <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> resigned two days after Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>., D-Mich. and a member of the university's board, hinted that the federal aid could be in jeopardy unless a deaf president were Deaf groups and schools around the country had supported the students' demands, as had a majority of the Gallaudet faculty. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 44, was a finalist for the position when <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON> was selected last Sunday. Before becoming dean in 1986 of <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s largest undergraduate department, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> served as a psychology professor at the school After students learned of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s appointment, they attempted to put into perspective a struggle that had captured worldwide attention. `` This is not the end; this is the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Bridgetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, a protest leader. `` This is where we start from now. We have gained this, and we will never have deafness work against us again,'' she said.

<HEAD>Lab Halts Shipment of Polio Vaccine for AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer of injectable polio vaccine has stopped shipping the drug to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> physicians after learning it was being used as an experimental AIDS treatment. Connaught Laboratories' Vice President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the company would like to cooperate in such a treatment but is prohibited by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from supplying physicians with the vaccine for anything other than its intended use _ to prevent polio. `` Some doctors in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have been working with AIDS patients, using our injectable polio product,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` As soon as it came to our attention, we were required to contact the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to determine if they had all the approvals.'' He said the physicians did not have the required approvals, so Connaught halted the shipments. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said an `` investigational new drug application'' should be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and studied to be sure experiments are conducted properly and that dosages would not adversely affect patients. `` The risks have to be weighed versus the benefits,'' she said. The old injectable <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> vaccine is no longer the preferred polio vaccine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having been replaced by an oral vaccine. It has shown promise for AIDS patients, relieving some cancer lesions, herpes infections, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researcher reported. The old, killed-virus vaccine can only be supplied by <PERSON> Connaught </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researcher and co-developer of the experimental treatment, said physicians wonder what will happen now to patients who have shown improvement after receiving the injections for as long as two years. `` Patients with cancers are getting better and doctors can no longer give them treatment.

 Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> portrayed himself today as a needed alternative to the three Democratic candidates leading him in polls one day before the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> greeted workers during a shift change at a factory in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and said, `` I'm very encouraged'' about Tuesday's primary, although he and his aides acknowledged on Sunday that he was far behind `` I think there are an awful lot of voters here in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who want an alternative to the kind of approach offered by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I offer a different kind of approach,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> on Sunday had turned his focus to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and said the vice president's response to the Iran-Contra affair amounted to: `` Gee whiz, that's great, let's go ahead.'' The Tennesseean resumed his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign after a weekend break, returning to a state where polls show him stuck in single digits far behind favorite sons <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and also trailing rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s campaign bought what deputy campaign manager <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> called `` a decent or modest amount'' of television airtime in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. It was thought to be in the range of $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 over the past week. But <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> downplayed expectations, saying <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s only aim was to be `` in the fray'' in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` We never put any serious organizational effort into <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. He cited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s strength and the timing a week after last week's Super Tuesday round of primaries that catapulted <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to the top tier of Democratic presidential contenders <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delivered a forceful attack on the vice president and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for the Iran-Contra affair in a long question-and-answer session with students at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school. He pointed to the guilty plea by former White House National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to misdemeanor charges relating to Iran-Contra as confirming `` the Reagan-Bush administration violated the law in a brazen way.'' `` We still do n't know what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role was,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the administration's sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in a bid to free hostages would have been `` hooted'' down as `` nuts'' if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was consulted. `` We did n't have that opportunity, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had that opportunity,'' he said. `` He evidently said, ` yeah, gee whiz, that's great, let's go ahead,''' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> voiced sympathy for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator whose <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bid is on the ropes in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, for a television ad being aired by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It says a vote for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is in effect a vote for a confused race and perhaps a brokered convention. `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s commercial tries to lump him in with back-room politics of a kind <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has not been associated with,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> continued to depict himself as a more electable alternative to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his other rivals but did not dwell on them in a series of speeches in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. But asked about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by the law students, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he would respond `` with relish.'' He repeated his contention that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lacks necessary foreign policy experience and said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has wrongly stated that there is no `` underclass'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator asserting that children trapped in a cycle of poverty do make up such an underclass. And he faulted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for shortcomings as a campaigner. `` I think he's not yet found his voice to articulate his message beyond the ` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle,''' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim that he helped turn around his state's economy. `` I do n't think he has succeeded in offering a clear vision of what he would do as president,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said his decision to spend Friday night through Sunday morning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not reflect an abandonment of his hopes for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He said he spent much of the time raising money by telephone, and said his fund-raisers have collected as much as $ 150,000 a day since last Tuesday. But acknowledging the polls in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said: `` There are two favorite sons here; I understand that.''

 Thousands of nurses at hospitals across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> held strikes, rallies and marches today in a last-minute attempt to get the Conservative government to allocate more money to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Bus services were halted or slowed on dozens of routes as crews at some some <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> transport centers walked out in sympathy, said <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where about 500 nurses mounted picket lines at 15 hospitals, nurses delivered a cake with a message to Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who will unveil the budget in Parliament on Tuesday. `` We hope we will get a bigger slice of the budget,'' said 19-year-old student nurse <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government, expected to make substantial tax cuts, has ruled out a big increase in the service's $ 41 billion budget Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has ordered a review of the service and plans to encourage more Britons to take out private health insurance. Outside the capital, strikes were `` fairly limited,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, one of two health unions sponsoring the protest. The third major union, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION>, has a no-strike code of principle. Overall, 515,000 nurses work in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rise Less Than Half of Preceding Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in January, less than half the pace turned in during the previous month, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gain in inventories pushed them up by $ 3 billion in January to a seasonally adjusted $ 705.85 billion. The inventory increase came as total business sales were falling 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 462.78 billion in January, reversing much of the big 1.2 percent December increase in sales. The January gain in inventories held on shelves and backlots followed an even larger 0.9 percent increase in December. The Janaury rise was held back by a 1 percent decline in inventories held by retailers. This decrease reflected primarily a 3.3 percent drop in the backlog of unsold cars as dealers offered new incentive programs to spur lagging sales. Analysts had worried that a huge rise in unsold inventories during the final three months of the year would force production cutbacks and weak economic growth in the early part of 1988. But economists have recently modified their views somewhat, contending that the slowdown in growth in the early part of this year will not be as severe as they had feared. The 1 percent decline in inventories held at the retail level was accompanied by an increase of 1.6 percent in inventories at the wholesale level and a 0.8 percent rise in manufacturing inventories. The 0.7 percent overall sales decline was led by a 1.7 percent drop in sales by manufacturers and a 0.2 percent decline in sales at the retail level. Sales at the wholesale level rose 0.4 percent in January. In an advance report on Friday, the government said that retail sales in February had risen by 0.6 percent. The combination of falling sales and rising inventories pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio up from 1.51 in December to 1.53 in January. That means it would take 1.53 months to exhaust inventories at the January sales pace, still a ratio that is not considered abnormally high.

<HEAD>Documents Released In Copper-7 Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Company documents reveal that <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> misled doctors and federal officials about safety characteristics of its Copper-7 contraceptive device, according to lawyers for the plaintiff in a lawsuit. According to documents released last week by a federal court, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> apparently hid complaints about the Copper-7 from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, lawyers said. Eventually, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> task force recommended that a federal grand jury investigate whether any laws were broken by <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s allegedly misleading reports on animal studies for a number of products, including the Copper-7. No charges were filed. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, said testimony and documents not yet made public will show the company did not mislead anyone. The Copper-7 was a popular intrauterine device from 1974 to 1988, when <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> withdrew it from the market citing the costs of lawsuits claiming it caused health problems. Many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women continue to use Copper-7 IUDs and <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> recently resumed manufacturing the device in order to fill foreign orders. The Searle documents, produced for a May 16 trial in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, became public last Thursday on order of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>. The judge rejected <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s arguments that the internal company memorandums be kept confidential because of trade secrets and other reasons. `` These documents can be characterized as the tip of the iceberg,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> attorney who represents <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, a Melrose woman who claims to have been made infertile by the Copper-7. `` Once all the documents are disclosed -LRB- to the public -RRB-, they will collectively establish without a doubt that the Copper-7 causes -LRB- infection -RRB- and <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew about it, but did not disclose it to doctors or to women,'' <PERSON> Coresi </PERSON> said. Nationally, there have been 17 trials over <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s Copper-7, 14 of them decided in the company's favor. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s case `` will be the first case tried against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> where the jury will be presented with evidence from <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s files showing what <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew about the hazards of the IUD, when they knew about them and what they did about them _ which was to conceal the information,'' <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> said. Strain said, `` We are confident when a jury hears all the evidence, reviews all the documents and, most importantly, hears from the doctors that they will conclude the Copper-7 is a good IUD that does not cause infection.'' A major issue will be whether Copper-7's withdrawal `` tail'' string was a single strand of polypropylene incapable of transporting infection-causing bacteria into the uterus, as <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> contends, or if it was made up of many tiny strands that could act as a tunnel for bacteria, as <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> contends. One of the Searle documents quotes a company official saying for the first time that, although the Copper-7 string is considered a single line, it actually is a `` bundle of fused micro-filaments.''

<TEXT>
 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are planning to transplant brain cells from aborted fetuses into patients with Parkinson's disease in an effort to find a treatment for the crippling disease. Doctors in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> recently performed similar tests but physicians say it is too early to tell if they succeeded in reducing or eliminating the effects of the disease. The procedure has not been attempted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers say they are ready to try the procedure on humans after having tested it on monkeys. `` Based upon the technical problems and what we have to do, I think there is a good chance we will be ready to do a human sometime within the year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, professor of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and director of the neurobehavior laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s School of Medicine. <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said in a recent interview the use of fetal tissue raises many ethical questions. Those questions include how tissue should be obtained from aborted fetuses without violating the sanctity of human life, whether the method of abortion should be altered to preserve the tissue and if the technology could foster a new industry geared to the production of human cells for transplant. Also at issue is how to obtain permission for transplant from a woman who aborts her fetus, or whether it is needed at all. `` Abortion is a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> said. `` But as long as it occurs, I believe it is immoral to let tissue and materials go to waste if it can cure people who are suffering and dying.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, said only a few major medical centers should conduct brain-cell transplants. `` Brain transplants is an environment in which charlatans, quacks and ripoff artists can flourish,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. In his experiments, <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> and his associates have reversed disease-like symptoms in monkeys through grafting of fetal brain cells. Parkinson's disease victims suffer from a lack dopamine, which transmits nerve cell messages to the muscles. The disease is often characterized by tremors, rigidity or loss of balance, and afflicts at least 350,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>EPA Decides Against Special Scrutiny Of Cancer-Causing Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 18 months of review, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to subject a common herbicide to special scrutiny of its cancer-causing potential. Subsequent studies have failed to confirm that 2,4-D causes cancer, despite a 1986 finding by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> wheat farmers who mixed their own 2,4-D more than 20 times a year stood an eight-fold greater chance of developing a cancer of the lymphatic system called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an agency spokesman said. The study said home and garden users were not exposed to enough 2,4-D to cause concern. Sold under dozens of trade names, 2,4-D _ short for dichlorophenoxyacetic acid _ is believed the fourth most widely used pesticide in the nation, with more than 39 million pounds of active ingredient sold in 1985. The great bulk of that is believed to be used for broadleaf weed control in wheat fields, though 2,4-D also is widely used on highway rights of way, on lawns and in forests. Despite <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, <ORGANIZATION> Chemlawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major lawn care company, will not restore 2,4-D to its products until a special <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> study of its employees _ of whom perhaps 3,000 used 2,4-D on 80 or so occasions per year _ is completed, said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardymon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hardymon </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` probably is right.'' But <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, staff scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, said of the decision, `` I think it's outrageous.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, she said, appeared to have given great weight to animal studies showing no cancer-causing potential by 2,4-D. `` We only do animal studies when we do n't have human studies,'' but in this case a good study of humans _ the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> farmers _ was disregarded, she said Another chemically related herbicide, 2,4,5-T, `` was banned mostly because of birth defects -LRB- among humans -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> ... and that -LRB- study -RRB- is not anywhere near as hard to refute as the study <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> did.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>, confirming trade press reports of the agency's decision, said Friday, `` It was a tough call.'' In addition to the animal studies that failed to show an effect, `` I think there are quite a few -LRB- human -RRB- epidemiology studies'' that also fail to confirm the cancer-causing ability of 2,4-D. <ORGANIZATION> Chemlawn </ORGANIZATION> says it knows of at least five human studies that show no cancer effect from 2,4-D The company did not detail those, but a pair of studies of farm and forest workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> is frequently cited. The first study found elevated incidence of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and another cancer called multiple myeloma, but did not examine exposure to pesticides. The second study, however, found no excess risk of cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals of the 2,4-D class. The herbicide 2,4-D aroused suspicion because it can be contaminated with small amounts of chemicals related to the dioxins, though there are no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reports, and only one abroad, of contamination with the most toxic form of dioxin. That form of dioxin is the most powerful cancer-causing agent ever tested in the laboratory. The contaminants of 2,4-D generally have only about 1 percent of the cancer-causing power of the most toxic dioxin.

<HEAD>The British Are Coming, But Not All Falklanders Thrilled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN LEONARD</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prospect of British soldiers staging war games on the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> is making some islanders a bit uneasy about upsetting <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which still claims sovereignty over the tiny archipelago. Less than a thousand troops are expected to be flown in Thursday for the military exercise, a test of how quickly <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can respond to an island invasion. Some islanders say they feel reassured by the 24-day drill, but others fear it unnecessarily provokes the Argentines, who lost the war with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the islands in 1982. `` The situation between us and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is so delicate that these exercises are bound to be a cause of trouble,'' said islander <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>. `` I can understand there are excellent possibilities for training down here, but I feel the exercise is not a very good thing from the point of view of our relations with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' But resident <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceballos </PERSON> supports the war games. `` I think the Argentines are being a bit silly,'' she said. `` They are overreacting, as they always do. If they had n't kicked up such a fuss, I probably would n't have given the whole exercise a thought.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, a boat captain, said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has no say in the matter. `` This place is British, and what happens to it is the problem of the British and us,'' he said. `` It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Argentines.'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has led a chorus of Latin American protest against Operation Fire Focus, as the exercise is named. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has denied it is provoking <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. But after initially refusing to say how many troops would be involved, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has sought to allay the objections by announcing that only a force of fewer than 1,000 soldiers would be flown in. British authorities want to insulate the troops from the populace. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlier </PERSON>, commander of British forces on the islands, says contact will be kept to a minimum. The settlers, however, will be asked to report sightings of soldiers who might be playing the enemy's role during the exercise on the rocky, windswept islands, he told a news conference last week. <PERSON> Carlier </PERSON> denied reports that farms would be used as targets of mock attacks, and said wildlife sanctuaries would be avoided. Plans reportedly have been made for the half-dozen tourists presently on the islands to be fishing or bird-watching far from the action while Operation Fire Focus is under way. The exercise technically began March 7, with mock intelligence reports being sent to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> about enemy troop movements against the islands. It concludes March 31. In 1982, when <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> seized the islands, the absence of a runway capable of taking long-range aircraft meant <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had to respond by sea. It took weeks for a naval task force to make the 8,000-mile voyage. During that time the Argentines dug in, and were dislodged only after a 74-day war that claimed the lives of 712 Argentine and 258 British servicemen. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has since spent $ 690 million on an airport in the islands that can accommodate troop flights in case of another attack. Falklanders have grown used to the luxury of an airport that can get them directly to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and there have been some grumblings at the disruptions travelers are likely to suffer during the exercise.

 Four armed Mexican naval personnel who said they were pursuing drug smugglers apparently interrogated a group of American picnickers on a beach more than a half mile north of the U.S.-Mexican border, authorities said. The four Mexicans were arrested Sunday night, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. The four men, whose names were being withheld, interrogated a group of 10 to 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who were picnicking on the beach, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON>, chief agent for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` It's a very serious situation,'' <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON> said today. `` Our investigation is not complete at this time, but it's possible the Americans were being interrogated against their will.'' Border Patrol agents scanning the area in a helicopter spotted the four men dressed in Mexican naval infantry uniforms and armed with fully loaded automatic rifles, <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON> said. The weapons were standard military issue, he added. `` Initial statements taken were that they were pursuing narcotics smugglers. But that has not been confirmed and there is no indication that narcotics were being smuggled in the area at the time,'' <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON> said. Local residents frequently picnic on the beach into the night, but <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON> said authorities had not been able to speak to any of the picnickers because they scattered when the helicopter hovered overhead. The Mexican men said they had been chasing two suspected drug or arms smugglers up the beach when they were discovered. The Mexicans headed south and were intercepted before they could get across the border. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, spokesmen for the foreign ministry and the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> navy said they had no information on the incident. The men were being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION> sector station, solely for investigation of immigration violations, he said. `` There is no doubt that the individuals knew they were in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the agent said. He added that any other allegations, including possible weapons violations, would be considered at a later time. Five sheriff's deputies were called to assist in the arrests, which occurred without incident, <PERSON> Cozart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials as well as the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and Mexican military officials were notified of the arrests.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> demanded today that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> keep his `` Star Wars'' missile defense system alive, arguing that cutting the high-tech program because of domestic budget pressures would be `` irresponsible in the extreme.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, kicking off an administration campaign keyed to the program's fifth anniversary, charged that congressional cuts in his <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> have `` set the program back one to two years.'' Even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has reached the point in his presidency where he has sent his last budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he pledged in an address to the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis to see the program continued. And he lauded the technological advances that have been made, asserting that the program has `` progressed more rapidly'' than first thought possible. `` We will continue to research SDI, to develop and test it, and as it becomes ready, we will deploy it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed. The president restated his belief that without the space-based missile defense, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be left defenseless in the face of an advanced Soviet space-weapons program. `` A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> called ` The Soviet space challege' warns that the Soviet space program points in one disturbing direction. ... the methodical pursuit of a war-fighting capability in space,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> charged. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has made cuts for the past four years in administration SDI requests, `` We would be dangerously undeprepared,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted. `` There's been a tendency by some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to discuss SDI as if its funding could be determined purely by domestic considerations, unconnected to what the Soviets are doing,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme.'' The president argued that `` some in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' have denied additional funds `` because they say SDI wo n't work. Well, it wo n't if we do n't develop it and test it.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should realize that it is no longer a question of whether there will be a SDI program or not. The only question will be whether the Soviets are the only ones who have strategic defenses while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains entirely defenseless,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The pro-SDI campaign comes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has placed constraints on SDI testing and expenditures, and as Soviet arms control negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> attempt to crimp the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort amid negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by half. The president has rarely missed a chance to plug the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort. Even at a light-hearted commemorative ceremony last week to honor Notre Dame's legendary football coach <PERSON> Knute </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech contained a passage referring to the `` dark side'' of the world's technological progress and arguing that his plan would solve the nuclear dilemma He pointed to the millions of civilians and military killed in World Wars I and II, and said if a third worldwide conflagration occurs in the nuclear age, `` it's estimated that 90 percent of the casualties will be civilian.'' The president said SDI would `` point the way out'' of this problem. `` It's given us the promise of basing our security in the future on protection rather than the threat of retaliation. SDI offers a chance to reverse not only the nuclear arms build-up, but also to reverse the trend that in effect has put a lower and lower value on human life,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Opponents of the program argue that it will cost untold billions and wo n't work, and that it will only encourage the Soviets to abandon arms control efforts and increase their offensive weapons in order to best <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defensive systems. In the last fiscal year, the administration sought $ 5.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allowed only $ 3.6 billion. <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> also banned the use of federal funds for any SDI tests that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Pentagon officials including <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> have said no such tests are planned for the near future. While the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has argued that the ABM Treaty forbids much research, testing and development of an SDI system, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has insisted on a so-called `` broad'' interpretation of the treaty that would permit expanded SDI tests and development. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at their December summit, in essence agreed to disagree for a time on the issue, saying in a joint communique they would observe the ABM Treaty `` as signed in 1972, while conducting their research, development and testing as required.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have remained at odds over how to address the issue.

Race founder <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON> lost the lead a second time somewhere between <LOCATION> Kaltag </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Unalakleet </LOCATION> along the frozen <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Unalakleet </LOCATION> at 6:42 a.m. with nine dogs. <LOCATION> Unalakleet </LOCATION> is 889 miles from the race's start in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, and 269 miles from the finish in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Unalakleet </LOCATION>, the teams run north along the barren, windswept coast. The next checkpoint is Shaktoolik, 40 miles farther up the trail. <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> had paced the race for more than 400 miles, and then lost the lead to <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> on Saturday along the <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. But in the dark outside <LOCATION> Kaltag </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> jumped back out front. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> had trailed <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Kaltag </LOCATION> by more than two hours. <LOCATION> Redington </LOCATION> started the race with 15 dogs and had dropped six of them at checkpoints along the trail by Sunday.

<HEAD>Crop-Killing Rains Follow Devastating Drought</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Farmers who prayed for rain during a devastating three-year drought have faced nearly four months of almost daily downpours, which threaten to wash away any chance of an agricultural rebound. The rains that began in November have caused widespread flooding in rural areas, swelling rivers, turning streets into streams, and virtually isolating some villages by knocking out phone lines and bridges. It also has severely hampered the recovery of farmers who five months ago were in the throes of drought, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minstry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Last week, eight soldiers drowned while fording a flood-swollen river in the eastern highlands. By the weekend, police said 66 people had been killed by lightning since the first storms broke. `` We're working all hours and weekends too,'' said <PERSON> Temba </PERSON> <PERSON> Munyarara </PERSON>, a handyman who works mainly in poor black suburbs. `` It's sad to see the damage that's being done but it's been good for me.'' It is in the countryside, where most of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s 8.2 million people live, that floods threaten agricultural recovery after the long drought. About 70 percent of the population depends on agriculture for income. Likewise, the bulk of the land-locked nation's export income comes from cash crops such as cotton, coffee, corn, sugar, tea and tobacco. Last year, agricultural output fell 18 percent, or $ 180 million, as a result of drought. Business Trends, the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly economic analysis, reported that the losses would be recouped with the onset of the regular rains. But the agriculture ministry's most recent crop and livestock report says that in most areas, further widespread rain will `` do more harm than good.'' Cotton, peanuts and tobacco are being severely damaged, the report said, but it predicted that if the rains ease off, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> still can expect bumper harvests. The report also said ample water has been stored underground and in lakes and dams to carry <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> through the coming dry season, which usually lasts from May to October.

The cups, plates, jugs, bowls and lamps are made of red clay and painted with a high-quality, black glaze, said the spokeman, who asked not to be identified. `` All that is visible on the seabed is a spread of pottery,'' he said. `` It is too early to judge with any confidence how much of the wreck survives.

<TEXT>
 Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are developing powerful microwave generators to assess the effects of such beams on their air, land and naval forces, according to a university researcher. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Florig </PERSON>, a radiation policy specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, says the sophisticated electronics used in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> weapon systems could make them particularly vulnerable to attack. `` The biggest fear is that an enemy might use high-power microwaves -LRB- HPM -RRB- to jam or burn out the electronic hardware upon which many military systems rely. Both strategic and tactical systems are possible targets _ missiles, re-entry vehicles, satellites, aircraft, tanks, radars, and communications and navigation equipment,'' <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> wrote in the March issue of the IEEE Spectrum, a journal published by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. He observed that `` because the forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> depend more heavily on sensitive electronics in ` smart weapons' and sophisticated radars than do Soviet and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces, the West could be more vulnerable to microwave weapons.'' Decisions on whether to deploy microwave weapons are still several years off, <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said last year in its annual `` Soviet Military Power'' report that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has completed enough research that `` no significant technological obstacles stand in the way of a prototype short-range tactical RF -LRB- radio-frequency -RRB- weapon.'' Another Defense Department publication, `` The Soviet Space Challenge,'' issued last November, said `` the Soviets could test a ground-based radio-frequency weapon capable of damaging satellites in the 1990s.'' <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> said there are `` obvious ethical issues'' involved in further development and deploying of microwave weapons, in view of their potentially fatal effects on troops. `` HPM weapons that merely stun the nervous system temporarily seem, like short-acting chemical agents, to be more humane than lethal force,'' he said. `` But HPM weapons that blind, burn or bake people to death are likely to be viewed as an abhorrent addition to the arsenal.'' The difference between a disabling and lethal microwave power level is largly one of range, <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> said, adding that `` pulsed HPM weapons might be designed with pulse repetition rates too low to harm people but with enough peak power to burn out hardware.'' Military facilities involved in high-power microwave research include <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Adelphi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surface </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dahlgren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> AFB near <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, N.M. Research work also is being carried out at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosado </PERSON>, acting director of the research and technology division at <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, told a symposium of government and industry officials last August that `` the nature of warfare will be completely changed by the use of these weapons.'' Devices capable of generating high-power microwaves include the magnetron and klystron, along with newer devices such as the vircator -LRB- virtual-cathode oscillator -RRB-, gyrotron, free-electron laser and beam-plasma generator. All the devices function by converting the kinetic energy of an electron beam into the electromagnetic energy of a microwave beam. <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that `` the Soviets have traditionally been strong in certain sources like the gyrotron. They may maintain a lead in some of those areas. `` But things are rapidly evening up, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> may currently be ahead in some areas. For the areas where intense computation is needed for design, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> definitely has an advantage,'' he said. In his IEEE Spectrum article, <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> noted that the microwave generator itself is only a small part of any high-power weapon system. `` A major challenge of HPM weapon design is to develop power supplies that are small and light enough to be used on mobile, airborne or space platforms,'' he wrote. At very high power levels, microwave weapons might even detonate missile warheads, bombs or artillery shells, in addition to burning out electronic components, <PERSON> Florig </PERSON> said, while at lower intensities microwaves can trigger `` spurious signals'' that might jam or disable electronic circuitry. `` Several crashes of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Blackhawk helicopter since 1982 are thought to have resulted from radio frequency interference with their flight control systems when they were flying near ground - or ship-based radar or communication transmitters,'' he said

 A rare collection of early 1940s recordings of native South Seas music which was found gathering dust in a widow's attic was presented Monday to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The collection, which went to the museum's American Folklife Center, includes 143 acetate disc recordings of music from the <LOCATION> Marquesas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, Java, <LOCATION> Madura </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kangean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> north of Java. The recordings were made by <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahnestock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in 1940 and 1941. Touring the South Seas aboard a three-masted, 137-foot schooner, the brothers collected <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> bird specimens for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, updated nautical charts for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydrographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and recorded indigenous music for a family foundation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Fahnestocks also made several shortwave radio broadcasts from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> that were carried live by the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> network. A recording of one such broadcast by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahnestock </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> in 1940, taken from the library's collection of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> transcriptions, was played at Monday's ceremony. Their ship, Director II, struck a shoal and sank near <LOCATION> Gladstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, on Oct. 18, 1940, without loss of life, but the <PERSON> Fahnestocks </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in February 1941 and chartered a sailboat to make new recordings and secretly gather intelligence for President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in anticipation of war with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Besides the 16-inch, 78-rpm discs, which the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> plans to clean and transcribe on tape, the Fahnestock collection also includes five reels of color film, a ship's log and numerous letters and magazine and newspaper articles about the expeditions. The collection had been stored in the attic of <ORGANIZATION> Sheridan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION>'s widow, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahnestock </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of Great Mills in southern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> until she decided to donate the materials to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986. It is the largest collection of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> recordings ever acquired by the library's Archive of Folk Culture, and the last known attempt to record a documentary of traditional cultures in that region before the mass disruptions of World War II. The library's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folklife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, established in 1976, engages in scholarly research, preservation and presentation of folk culture traditions.

 A masked man fired on four Saudi diplomats, wounding three, in the parking lot of a city hotel, it was reported Monday. The four diplomats were fired on Sunday as they left the Eko Holiday Inn in a car, the government-owned New Nigerian newspaper reported. It said the gunman apparently had been waiting for them. A fourth diplomat gave chase, but the gunman escaped over a wall near the parking lot, the newspaper said. No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> has declared that <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> will be the official religion of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, but critics say the move is merely a ploy to prevent his ouster and woo the Moslem majority. Government officials on Monday were caught off guard by <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s announcement, made the day before to a Moslem congregation in <LOCATION> Sarsina </LOCATION>, 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said the laws of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> should conform to the Moslem code of conduct. `` The day-to-day life of the nation must be guided by the tenets of Islam and the ideals of Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>,'' he said. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said he had no information on the change. `` We do not know what exactly the president wants to do,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Eighty-five percent of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 105 million people are Moslem, but the country has had a secular constitution since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1971. Minority religions are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition parties, which have been calling since November for the president's ouster, opposed the change. Parliament, which is controlled by <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to debate the change in April. `` This is an illegal government and illegal Parliament. It has no right to enact any legislation,'' said <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was referring to parliamentary elections earlier this month that were boycotted by opposition groups. The Moslem fundamentalist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, also opposed the move. `` A government which came to power illegally and is staying much against the wishes of the people can never do any good to Islam, the people or the country,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujahid </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Jamaat </ORGANIZATION> leader. Surenjit Sengupta of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This is yet another gimmick by President <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> to hang onto power.'' But <PERSON> Wali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON>, an independent member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Such a legislation will only reflect the faith of the vast majority of the people.'' Others believe the Islamic law, with its stringent punishments, could curb crime and increase productivity.

<HEAD>Advertising Buys Fall Off in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only three presidential candidates ran substantial television campaigns for Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, a sharp contrast to the frenzied multi-million dollar advertising buys that led up to Super Tuesday. The big spender in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who bought about $ 400,000 worth of time. Two Democrats, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were hoping for respectable showings short of victory in a state that is fielding two popular favorite sons. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said it was spending about $ 250,000 while <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> media expenditures were estikakis and Albertmated at $ 200,000 to $ 300,000. The sparse media buys and tame ads were in contrast to the charges and counter-charges that marred the airwaves ahead of last week's far-flung Super Tuesday contests in 20 states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was running two advertisements in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ one a biographical spot and the other showing him with world leaders and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The latter ad, used since the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary last month, says there is a difference between presidential and congressional leadership. The point is to compare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favorably to rival <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader. However, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s chances of winning the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination plummeted after he lost all 17 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contests last week, and he sharply cut addition to mounting the strong TV campaign, she said. On the Democratic side, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were neck and neck as each sought a home-state victory. Neither favorite son was running TV ads and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> conceded a lack of money for ads was hurting his prospects to beat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Polls showed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in third place with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., lagging behind `` With the favorite sons in the race, obviously nobody expected us to win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON>. `` The objective is to be very competitive and to demonstrate that we can do well all over the country.'' To that end, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was running three ads, including two he used for Super Tuesday _ a spot stressing his experience as a chief executive and another in which a union official says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a `` shot-and-beer kinda guy'' but his economic policies put people to work. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> introduced an new ad saying the days of backroom dealing are over _ a response to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s contention that there will be no first-ballot victor at the Democratic convention and he still could secure or at least influence the nomination. `` Some people would like to turn back the clock, to go back to the days when the voters did n't really pick their nominee,'' says the announcer in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> commercial. `` They say you must turn over that power to them at a brokered convention. But you do n't have to do this On Tuesday, you can pick the next president ...'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was running a mix of three advertisements in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, all of them positive messages. One especially made for <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> won six states on Super Tuesday by taking his case to the people, and asks <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> voters for their support. The other two ads, used throughout the South for Super Tuesday, have a populist thrust. One chides American companies for investing in jobs overseas rather than at home and the other says big chemical polluters, price fixers, corporate law breakers, greedy drug manufacturers `` do n't want <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> to be president'' because he's fought them in the past. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> made a poor Super Tuesday showing and was skipping <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to concentrate on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses March 26. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had used ads critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> in the Super Tuesday states and both candidates came back with on-air `` attack ads'' to which <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> could n't afford to respond.

 Riot police used tear gas today to disperse about 600 teachers demanding their salaries and yelling `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go.'' Strikes and disturbances broke out when some workers demanded cash instead of the bags of food the government today began distributing to public employees until it has the money for salaries. For the first time, the disturbances reached into the central business district. Police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas grenades, forcibly removed the teachers, who were blocking traffic in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The teachers shouted, ` We want out pay,'' `` Books yes, arms no,'' and `` Justice.'' The nation's military strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, its new civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, and other top government officials ended an emergency meeting at 2 a.m. today. There was no immediate comment on what action, if any, they took to overcome <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions aimed at bringing down the military regime. The government has said it does not have enough money to meet this week's public payroll of $ 33 million for its 130,000 public employees. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency had prepared 12,000 of the bags of food for distribution this week. They contained basic staples of the Panamanian diet such as rice, beans, flour, potatoes, fresh vegetables and beef. The `` dignity bags'' were being sold by the government for between $ 15 and $ 16 each. It was believed that officials were not demanding cash, and it was not clear how the workers were paying for the supplies. In another development, men in civilian clothes fired guns outside a church service in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday and attacked a TV cameraman after roughing up a woman who was selling an anti-government newsletter. No one was injured. The attack came at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> the King, long a center of government opposition activity, as its pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, was beginning a late-morning Mass. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, installed by the ruling military last month as minister in charge of the presidency, has been meeting with his chief advisors almost constantly since last Thursday. Sunday's meeting was the first time that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been known to join them Meanwhile, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was said by a chief aide to be `` in excellent spirits, working very hard, always on the phone and maintaining his determination not to surrender.'' Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the general's press officer, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was telephoning other countries in search of financial assistance and received `` some very positive answers from some friendly governments.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> declined to elaborate, but he added, `` this is a very complex situation that can not be solved in 72 hours.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Almost one in every five workers in this nation of 2.5 million people is employed by the government. While <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s popularity has fallen recently, he has so far enjoyed at least the outward support of government employees. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, administration officials acknowledged Sunday that the economic sanctions imposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday were intended to make it harder for the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government to pay the public employees. The timing of the sanctions `` was not a coincidence,'' said one administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the withholding of $ 6.5 million in monthly <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> fees due <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this week and eliminated a trade preference the country has enjoyed under the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative. Earlier, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended all economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and suppported legal efforts to freeze an estimated $ 50 million in official Panamanian funds held in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks. The legal action was taken by attorneys for <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was deposed as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president on Feb. 26 in a coup engineered by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has been in hiding ever since, he still is recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president The government ordered <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 118 local and foreign banks closed temporarily on March 3, saying it could not provide them with enough money to cover withdrawals. There was no word Sunday of when the banks would reopen. Their closure has left the country in economic chaos, with businessmen and individuals unable to cash checks and hoarding precious dollars, which <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses as its currency. In the attack outside the church on Sunday, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter and photographer said between 8 and 10 men dressed in civilian clothes fired handguns in the air and smashed the windows of automobiles parked outside the Church of Christ the King. No one was hurt in the shooting, but two of the gunmen struck an Italian television cameraman and stole his video camera as he was filming the incident. The men threw rocks at other reporters on the scene.

<HEAD>Government Splits As Thatcher Lets The Pound Go Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Conservative government has split over how to handle the surging pound in a dispute that has overshadowed Tuesday's budget and its expected tax bonanzas for the wealthy. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s willingness to let the pound soar unchecked has thrown in doubt the future of her top <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. The chancellor of the exchequer is so angry at Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> overruling his policy of keeping sterling in line with the West German mark that he may make Tuesday's annual budget announcement his last, published reports have said. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is ranked among <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most able <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials since World War II. `` The stark fact is that the prime minister and the chancellor are in open conflict over a crucial part of our economic policy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, finance spokesman for the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the split which one described as a `` healthy argument.'' The pound, meanwhile, continued a week-long surge, topping $ 1.86 in trading on Monday, an eight-cent jump from a week ago. The government split was revealed in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> rejected Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervention such as selling pounds or reducing interest rates to make sterling less attractive to foreign investors. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> believes that lower interest rates will encourage borrowing and fuel inflation, now at a low 3.3 percent. Curbing inflation has been a cornerstone of her tight-fisted economic policies since she won power in 1979. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s strategy has been to keep sterling at around 3 marks. Sterling traded Monday at 3.08 marks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not a member of the exchange mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links eight other major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, including the mark, in a stabilizing arrangement. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief economist at stockbrokers <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>, said that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s stance has aggravated the problems caused by a high pound, which makes British exports more expensive. `` There is virtually no ceiling to the exchange rate at the present time,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said in a television interview Sunday. `` All round, our international trade performance is likely to suffer.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit, which soared by one-third to a record $ 2.8 billion in January, was worsening before the latest upsurge in sterling. `` Lawson Must n't Go,'' the respected financial weekly, The Economist, said in a headline over an article which added, `` The main reason is that Mr. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is good at his job.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, accused by some critics of being increasingly authoritarian since she won a third term last June, is also at loggerheads with another senior member of her Cabinet, Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. A leaked government document last week confirmed reports that she has told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to rethink part of a planned overhaul of the state school and examination system. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, 56, an economist and former financial journalist appointed chancellor in 1983, was expected to unveil Tuesday <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first surplus budget for nearly 20 years. Rank-and-file Conservatives grumbled that the argument over the pound had clouded what many of them predicted would be a budget marking a high point of an economic strategy of restraining state spending. `` It would be much happier if this particular dispute had been kept private and, above all, kept private until after the budget was over and done with,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Biffen </PERSON>, a former Leader of the Commons who was dropped from the Cabinet last year. Higher-than-expected government revenues, boosted by tax receipts from higher wages and sales of state-owned assets, meant that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was expected to have a surplus of more than $ 5.5 billion on the $ 290 billion budget for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was expected to slash the top income tax rate _ payable on incomes over $ 76,200 a year _ from 60 percent to 50 percent or even lower. The basic tax rate _ at 33 percent when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won power in 1979 _ was expected to drop from the current 27 percent to 25 percent.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> restored low-level diplomatic ties Monday after a 20 year hiatus but a Hungarian official said full ties await resolution of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. An Israeli interest section office was opened in the Swiss Consulate in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, and a Hungarian interest section was opened in the Swedish Consulate in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> start spreadin' the news in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Tuesday after dazzling `` rat pack'' fans here at the start of their 29-city reunion tour. The three veteran showmen joked and sang with the same easy-going, cocktail lounge manner that has kept them in superstar ranks for decades as they performed the first of 40 shows in the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday night. <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, 72, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 62, and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 70, were as much adored as applauded by the 14,500 fans from teen-agers to people in their 80s. The show sold out an hour after tickets became available weeks ago, and scalpers were getting as much as $ 300 for a $ 40 seat. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> opened the show, staggering and swaggering onto the stage with his trademark cigarette and cocktail in hand. After slurring his way through, `` That's Amore,'' `` Everybody Loves Somebody -LRB- Sometime -RRB-,'' and a string of one liners, he yielded to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The `` Candy Man'' proved he still can, rousing the crowd with `` What Kind of Fool Am I?,'' `` Bojangles,'' and `` I've Got To Be Me.'' He also was cheered when he announced he gave up drinking three years ago. `` I've got to tell you the truth. Everybody backstage is being very cool, but I was n't this scared when I lived at 147th Street and Eighth Avenue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he confessed. But it was <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> _ Old Blue Eyes, The Man, The Voice, The Chairman of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> _ that most fans had come to see, and they were n't disappointed as he powered his way through hit after hit: `` What Now My Love,'' `` For Once In My Life,'' `` Mack The Knife,'' and the song he called the national anthem, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The trio then performed a medley of songs together, as women and at least one man dropped flowers on the stage. `` We bought tickets for ourselves because we knew we'll never see it again,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaix </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, a 30-year-old fan who was considering flying his parents to another city so they could catch the show. `` I saw <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> 15 years ago in <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and he's better than he's ever been,'' said <PERSON> Chaix </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>. `` I thought they looked great. For me, it was a once in a lifetime thing,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pobuta </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>. Said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hourcade </PERSON>: `` I'd have died if I had n't come tonight.'' After Tuesday night's show in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the `` Together Again'' tour moves to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Wednesday, then to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for two weekend shows. The tour is scheduled through October, with performances across the country. Other dates are to be announced in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer sought a mistrial today as the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial entered its third week, alleging that the state police have been intimidating witnesses and have made the trial `` fundamentally unfair.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> said that if the mistrial is not granted, his motion sought dismissal of the charge that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> tried to obstruct an investigation of an alleged death threat. `` Overt or subtle intimidation of witnesses who are to be called to testify in a proceeding is outrageous,'' the motion said. `` The conduct on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> is so egregious that it renders this trial fundamentally unfair.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> has denied attempting to intimidate witnesses, including <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, who was arrested Friday, a day after she testified on <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s behalf. She was arrested on a warrant that had been outstanding since January. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of ordering <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with an investigation of an alleged death threat by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, former head of state prison construction, against former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. At the time of the alleged threat on Nov. 12, she was about to testify before a grand jury investigating an unreported $ 350,00 campaign loan to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s allegations The trial's presiding officer, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the motion would be heard by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday morning. Craft's motion cited Ms. Fields' arrest on a warrant for allegedly failing to attend an Alcoholic Anonymous meeting following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction. The motion also mentioned published reports of a warrant for the arrest of another prospective witness, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> warrant, for allegedly impersonating a state official while repossessing a vehicle, was never served.

Meanwhile, testimony on the alleged threat continued today with former top gubernatorial aide <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> on the stand. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> testified that he was not attempting to protect <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> when he cooperated with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' attorney in planning a lie-detector test on whether a threat was made. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, testified last week that the conversation was taped so he and the polygrapher could have <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' exact language to use in preparing polygraph test questions for <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Craft said the governor is expected to be the last defense witness and will take the stand late this week or early next week. On Friday, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> testified that he considered the alleged threat to be `` a little spat, frivolous matter,'' and that he told <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to forget about it and that the matter would go away. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had talked with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a state official who testified that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> threatened Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s life during a conversation with Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> testified Friday that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had told him he had said Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> should keep her mouth shut about the $ 350,000 loan because `` there are a lot of people out there who are excitable and she could have harm come to her.'' Months ago, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> told reporters he thought <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' statement was `` good advice'' for Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment committee in January that he may have told <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> not to cooperate with the investigation, but insisted he was not adequately informed of the seriousness of the situation. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> resigned his prison construction position after a past assault conviction was disclosed. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> arrested Fields, Ms. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s secretary who had testified a day earlier that Ms. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> tended to exaggerate. Ms. Fields testified that she thought there had been no death threat. Ms. Fields was apprehended by <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officers and <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> police on a Jan. 18 warrant for alleged failure to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. She had been arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated. The <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> said Friday's arrest came after one of its officers notified his superiors that she was wanted. Craft termed the arrest an intimidation tactic by <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>'s only involvement was that he was told by officers that there was a warrant for her arrest. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and perennial political outsider who won the governorship on his fifth try, was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 5. In addition to the death threat allegation, he is accused of concealing the campaign loan and misusing $ 80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. A two-thirds' vote of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Lawmakers also could decide to bar him from future office. Some senators have said they want to seek a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on whether to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> after completing testimony on the death threat allegation. Others oppose the idea, saying they believe all the evidence should be heard before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to be impeached in six decades and the first ever in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Unlikely Coalition Could Kill Mississippi Constitution Reform
Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Critics of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 1890 constitution say it is anti-black and anti-business, but an unlikely coalition of blacks, business people and farmers may kill legislative efforts to rewrite the document. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who took office in January, said rewriting the constitution `` would show that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is ready to take a step into the next century.'' `` My biggest argument is that the 1890 constitution is a document that's, in a lot of ways, gotten us into dead solid last place and that we really ca n't do any worse,'' said <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who incorporated the call for a new constitution into his successful campaign last year. The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have each passed a bill that would allow voters to decide in a November referendum whether the constitution would be rewritten in a convention. A conference committee is working out differences in the two bills. When considering the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deleted all convention restrictions, including a requirement that the new document include the right-to-work provision from the current constitution. `` It's extremely important to industry and workers'' that a new constitution include right-to-work, which forbids employers and unions from signing contracts that would require employees to be union members, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of the Jackson-based <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A right-to-work statute was enacted in 1956 and added to the constitution in 1960. Farmers have expressed concern that a new constitution would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> too much latitude in raising taxes. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he believes a current constitutional property classification provision that allows a lower tax rate for farm land `` would be overlooked.'' Senators also deleted a provision for the governor to appoint 20 delegates in addition to those who would be elected from each of the 122 House districts. Blacks, who represent better than 30 percent of the state's voters, have said they would oppose a convention without the gubernatorial appointments because they fear they would not be proportionately represented in delegate voting <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> has said that if he is allowed to appoint delegates, he will geographically and racially balance the convention. Black legislators have said they fear a convention might reduce the size of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and make it more difficult for blacks to get elected, allow the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> authority to close any of the state's eight institutions of higher learning, and cut the number of locally elected public officials. The College Board recommended in 1985 closing <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s three predominantly black universities, but legislators rejected the propsal. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has the highest number of black elected officials in the nation. The House has 20 black members, and two blacks serve in the 52-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Black lawmakers said that while the original document may have been anti-black, they do not fear it now. `` The federal courts have removed many of the racist provisions,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, who is black. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON>, a political scientist and dean of the graduate school at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the current method of changing the constitution by amendment is a `` piecemeal way of overhauling a document that really needs to be rewritten.'' <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON> said if a convention is called, it will be `` extremely important that black people go out and vote.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> history professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansing </PERSON> is among those who favor rewriting the document. He said the old charter not only disenfranchised blacks, but poor whites as well with its poll tax and literacy requirement, although those provisions have been struck down by federal courts. `` That old constitution is inherently evil, so we ca n't modify it with amendments,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> car dealer and developer <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, who made rewriting the constitution the hallmark of unsuccessful campaigns for governor in 1975 and 1979 and for lieutenant govenor in 1983.

<HEAD>IRS Endorses Review of Tax Penalties Which Critics Say Hurt Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pledged support Monday to a review of tax penalties that were assessed last year in some 27 million cases _ penalties that have been criticized as a special burden on the poor. At the opening of a public inquiry into the maze of 154 penalties the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can impose, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> expressed the agency's own concern about the penalties, many of which were enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the past seven years in an effort to increase compliance with the tax laws. `` A penalty system that operates based on the wrong principles may provide appropriate sanctions for some types of behavior and yet have an overall negative impact on taxpayer behavior because it is not perceived as fair,'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said. Several witnesses at Monday's hearing accused the government of using penalties to raise revenues, rather than to assure compliance with the laws. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, cited the case of one business that underpaid employment taxes by 2 cents and was hit with a penalty of $ 400.29 `` We've created some sort of a monster here,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. `` We're going to change that some way.'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> and <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, endorsed a thorough review of tax penalties. A review also was endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> and associations representing lawyers, accountants and other tax professionals. `` We certainly hope there's not any reaction ... by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents in the field ... that penalties should be used as means of raising revenue,'' <PERSON> Chapoton </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said that when one penalty is stacked atop another, it indicates a goal of raising revenue. A major problem with penalties, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, director of the university's tax clinic program, is that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not given the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> sufficient guidance on how penalties should be applied. As a result, he said, penalties often are applied to taxpayers who have neither the funds to hire a lawyer or accountant nor knowledge of how the system works. `` The low-income taxpayer has about as much knowledge of how to obtain abatement of a penalty through problems resolution -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' `` consumer advocate'' -RRB- as he-she does of getting to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> `` Abuses by high-income taxpayers have brought about a plethora of new penalties. Unfortunately, the low-income taxpayer has been caught in this net.'' An even more basic problem, <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> said, is the difficulty in reading <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> tax forms in general. He cited a finding that instructions for Form 1040EZ _ the simplest tax form _ require an 8.45 grade reading level, compared to a 7.1 level to read the Wall Street Journal. Penalties in the tax law range from $ 1 for failing to file a statement on payment of dividends totaling less than $ 10 to a maximum of 25 percent of the tax owed for failing to pay on time to $ 10,000 for abetting a corporation in the understatement of its tax liability. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assessed 27 million penalties totaling $ 14 billion and excused another 4 million for $ 4 billion. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> for the way it applies penalties against taxpayers who file what the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> considers frivolous returns. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the penalty, which can be as much as $ 500, to discourage taxpayers from using arguments such as self-incrimination to avoid a proper tax return. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said he has evidence the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is imposing the penalty against those who write critical notes to the agency on their returns, even though the returns are completed and signed. He cited the much-publicized case of a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> woman who was hit with a penalty for such behavior and whose husband's life insurance policy was seized before a federal judge intervened. `` If that little old lady lived in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, would she get the same penalty?'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>. `` Who makes those decisions?'' <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> promised to check into the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> case but <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> quickly cautioned against it. `` I do n't think she wants you to review her case and flag her return,'' the senator said.

 Guards in a Brink's armored truck foiled a robbery attempt Monday when they returned fire on armed bandits who blocked a street on the city's outskirts with a truck and road grader, police said. Five or six bandits opened fire on the armored truck from behind the roadblock and from a car, police said. But the guards shot back and forced the bandits to flee. There were no reports of injuries to guards or robbers. Authorities did not disclose how much money was aboard the Brink's Securmark truck that was carrying the payroll for five or six businesses.

<HEAD>Senate Approves 31-Nation Treaty To Help Protect Ozone Layer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 83-0 Monday to approve a 31-nation treaty curbing emissions of chemicals that destroy the high-altitude layer of ozone which makes life on Earth possible. The treaty calls for a 20 percent reduction from 1986 emissions of the most active chlorofluorocarbon compounds, called CFCs, to take effect in 1993. There would be an additional 30 percent cut in mid-1998. Participating countries also pledged to impose trade restrictions on products containing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds from countries not signing the treaty. Major producing nations and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the cuts last September in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> under prodding from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the Scandinavian nations _ countries that banned use of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds in aerosol sprays in 1978. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had sought a 95 percent reduction. European countries before that had argued that a ban on new production capacity would be sufficient to protect ozone. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a major producer, won special provisions permitting that country to use the output of plants under construction and exceed the emissions limits temporarily. The Soviets signed the treaty in December. The Soviet exemptions, and similar provisions for developing nations, have led the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to conclude that the actual emissions reduction in 1998 could be only 35 percent instead of 50 percent. Backers of the treaty hope it will serve as a model for international agreement to control the `` greenhouse effect,'' the expected warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> caused by the growing concentration of several gases in the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion. CFC compounds, first formed in 1929, are widely used in refrigeration, production of plastic foams and as solvents to clean computer equipment. The compounds may last 100 years in the atmosphere, eventually rising to the ozone layer, 15 miles to 25 miles above the Earth's surface The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that a 1 percent shrinkage of the Earth's ozone layer will increase skin cancer by 5 percent or 6 percent. Whether the ozone layer is shrinking is hard to determine because ozone normally fluctuates every year, with sunspots and volcanic eruptions influencing how much is formed. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to report Tuesday on whether the ozone layer is getting thinner. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> researchers have said there might have been a decline of about 0.5 percent per year recently _ but that estimate was uncertain, and was being debated in a review group of 100 scientists from around the world. The treaty will not come into force until at least 11 countries, representing two-thirds of the world's production capacity for <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds, have ratified it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will become the second country, behind <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, to ratify.

 The military is killing and terrorizing civilians under the pretense of fighting communism, and the campaign has gone unchecked by the government, a human rights group charged Monday. Task Force-Detainees, a group formed by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to monitor rights violations under ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, charged that the military began its spree two months ago in northeastern <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> province. It called for an investigation and claimed that atrocities included the Feb. 11 slaying of <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivares </PERSON>, a leftist provincial leader who helped organize the group's probe. At a news conference, the group introduced a 6-year-old boy who said he was the only member of his family to survive a Jan. 23 massacre. Five others died. `` I saw soldiers shoot my father and mother, after which they turned to me and shot me in both legs,'' said <PERSON> Ronaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, his legs in casts. The rights group also claimed more than 1,000 people had fled their homes in the town of <LOCATION> Dinalungan </LOCATION>, about 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, to escape military operations. It said the violence was being waged under the guise of battling the 19-year-old communist insurgency in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` In the past, during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' time, we had military in the towns in the north but there was not this kind of strafing, massacre and burning of houses,'' said Bishop <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Labayen </PERSON>. `` We're sitting on a powder keg. In a statement, the group said: `` Task Force-Detainees hopes that President -LRB- <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will not simply dismiss this violation as yet another ` total lie' but instead will treat the matter with grave concern.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> became president in 1986 after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was toppled from power. <PERSON> Bienvenido </PERSON> <PERSON> Amora </PERSON>, chief investigator for the government's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he would contact the group about the charges. `` We would have appreciated it very much if the Task Force-Detainees had brought this matter to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> so that the -LRB- commission -RRB- could proceed to investigate this case accordingly,'' he said. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation showed 7,444 Filipino civilians were arrested illegally last year, eclipsing the 5,967 arrests in 1985 under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Spokesman <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said 672 of those detained in 1987 were tortured. The same day, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> claimed similar atrocities in a report released in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> branded the Amnesty report `` one-sided'' and charged it had relied on Task Force-Detainees for its information. She challenged both groups to provide evidence.

 A 31-year-old pacifist on Monday entered the fourth week of a hunger strike to try to win an alternative to compulsory military service. In October, a military court sentenced <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> to four years in prison on insubordination charges. On Feb. 22, an appeals court reduced his sentence to 26 months. The 6-foot 5-inch woodcarver, who weighed 222 pounds, started his hunger strike the next day. He said he has lost 22 pounds since then and will take only fruit juice and milk every other day until the Greek government establishes conscientious objection to military service. `` I wo n't eat until the government recognizes the right of the individual to act on the basis of conscience,'' <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> said in an interview at <LOCATION> Avlon </LOCATION> military prison 29 miles north of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Military service is compulsory in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where it averages about 21 months. Unlike some other European countries, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> offers no option to compulsory service, and objectors are routinely given long prison terms. Legal experts say there are about 300 Greeks imprisoned for refusing to serve in the military. Almost all are <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> belongs to one of the ancient Eastern Orthodox churches but says his pacifism is derived mainly from personal ideals rather than his religion. <PERSON> Stelios </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestos </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON>' three attorneys, said that 11 other conscientious objectors had recently gone into hiding after they were called up. But <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> presented himself to a military camp in Drama, in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where he was called up in March 1987. <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> said he was planning to appeal his sentence to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A new law under debate in the Greek parliament seeks to abolish prison terms for conscientious objectors but does n't provide for alternative service. Instead, conscientious objectors will be required to serve double time in the armed forces as non-combatants. But <PERSON> Marangakis </PERSON> said he would refuse to serve as a non-combatant because it represents a form of military service.

The kid that I play is in such an incredibly new situation,'' the 30-year-old actor said. `` Some people say that I just kind of walk through it, gawking,'' he said of his role in the movie, which was the nation's No 2 box-office draw in its debut last weekend. `` But my feeling was that the kid was in this state of wonder about the situation he was in, you know?'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> `` hung out a lot.'' `` The neat thing about him is that he's incredibly bright but he's still a kid,'' <PERSON> Reinhold </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Botha Says Main Issue in Angola is Timetable for Cuban Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Monday that <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has not presentated a plan for withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Cuban troops in that country and a timetable remains a central issue for regional peace. <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was asked at a news conference about an announcement Sunday by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that it and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials proposals for a southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace accord including a timetable for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal. He replied: `` That is not correct.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> Angolan </LOCATION> proposal `` appears to break no new ground'' on the issue of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the withdrawal timetable, along with who would supervise the pullout, `` is the issue that must be taken up.'' He spoke to reporters after a day of talks with <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state who specializes in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, aimed at advancing plans for peace in the region. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said they had `` extensive'' discussions of the situation in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and `` the question of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal as a prerequisite for implementing a settlement in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa-Namibia </LOCATION>. We discussed extensively the possibilities that exist in this respect.'' `` I've received interesting information,'' he added, and described the talks as `` useful'' but would not give details. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> might meet again Tuesday, but that nothing was set. Since 1981, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> has tried to negotiate a withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in return for an end to South African control over neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. His last meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was two years ago. Cuban troops help <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government fight the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla force backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In January, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> declared a willingness in principle to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> but no deal has been negotiated. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had told him it would begin direct talks with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on the Angolan civil war, which began with independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. Asked about this at the news conference, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> responded: `` I have said that I have no problem in talking directly with <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> -LRB- the Angolan capital -RRB- and to a large number of other African states.'' He denied reports that preliminary talks for such negotiations had been held. `` It's not necessary,'' he said. `` I could pick up a telephone and talk now.'' <PERSON> Kundi </PERSON> <PERSON> Payama </PERSON>, No. 2 man in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, repeated that <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was prepared to negotiate directly with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but also said previous direct talks on other matters had not produced results. `` I think we can negotiate with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> at any time as long as they deal honestly with us,'' he said, `` but not if -LRB- the talks -RRB- turn out to be just a tactic for gaining time.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Chief To Ask About Possible Reduction In Soviet Forces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was to ask his Soviet counterpart at talks beginning Tuesday in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> whether highly publicized changes in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> military doctrine mean reductions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, meeting Tuesday through Thursday with Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, will also discuss arms control, human rights, the proposed Soviet withdrawl from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and such dangerous military situations as a collision between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> last month, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official told reporters Monday. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has said he does n't want the meeting to pre-empt talks on reducing nuclear and conventional forces, but he does want to ask <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> about the emerging Soviet doctrine of `` reasonable sufficiency.'' `` We would like to get an idea of where they are going,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We will be asking them if this -LRB- new doctrine -RRB- is ... truly a change in their policy and not just a public recitation,'' said the official. `` What changes in Soviet equipment will we see? Will there be a shift in force structure?'' `` Over the years, we have seen quite a disparity -LRB- between -RRB- their nuclear doctrine and what force structure they have actually acquired,'' said the official. As early as 1977, then-Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breznev </PERSON> proclaimed that nuclear war was unwinnable. But the Soviets continued to bolster their nuclear arsenal, adding mobile long-range missiles that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say could dodge a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike. Such a capability, they say, appears contrary to the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction, implied by Soviet statements that nuclear war is unwinnable and insane. As far as the new doctrine of reasonable sufficiency is concerned, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, `` we do n't see any physical indication'' of change. `` That's why we want to ask them where to look.'' At the top of the American agenda, said the official, will be so-called `` dangerous incidents,'' such as the bumping incident in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Feb. 12, as well as the slaying of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1987 and the wounding of another last September. Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> blamed the collision on two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships which passed within 12 miles of the Soviet coast in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an assertion of the right of innocent passage from one body of international water to another. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which claims a three-mile territorial limit, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> claims that its territory extends 12 miles beyond its shores. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials recognize that limit but insist on the right of `` innocent passage,'' in this case from one side of the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> to the other. Administration spokesmen said that two Soviet vessels rammed the American ships. Whatever the Soviet objections to the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships in their waters, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday, `` ramming ships ... is hardly a proportionate and proper action ... People could get killed.'' The Soviets have never apologized for fatally shooting <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on March 24, 1985, although they did apologize for wounding Army Master Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, shot in the arm by a Soviet soldier on Sept. 16, 1987. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> hopes his meeting with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> will lead to guidelines to prevent such dangerous incidents, including near-collisions between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warplanes near one another's borders. `` Obviously, both sides use their aircraft to investigate intruders and potential intruders,'' the senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official told reporters. `` But there are safe ways to do that.'' `` Flying right in front of aircraft with erratic maneuvers, close fly-bys that come within inches, are dangerous practices,'' said the official. Administration officials say that sometimes superpower interceptors fly close enough to an intruder's wing that the resulting air current forces the opposing aircraft away from the border. A recent near-collision involved a long-range <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surveillance airplane, a P-3 Orion, and a Soviet Mig-23 Flogger over the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Jan. 11. The Soviet interceptor came within 15 feet of the Orion, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was scheduled to depart from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monday evening, arrive in the Swiss capital of <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> on Tuesday, dine with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> Tuesday night, meet him twice Wednesday and once Thursday before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later that day.

 Sikh extremists killed 21 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, including a family of four, it was reported Monday. Police shot and killed <PERSON> Balraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh radical wanted for several murders in <LOCATION> Patiala </LOCATION> on Monday, according to the state police control center in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. The deaths late Sunday and early Monday raised to at least 451 the number of killings blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals this year. Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for more autonomy or an independent homeland for the sect in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The northern state, the country's richest agricultural area, is the only one of Hindu-dominated <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> where Sikhs have a majority. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Sardul </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, his wife and two daughters were shot to death early Monday in <LOCATION> Jhander </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. The gunmen burned the family's house to the ground before fleeing, it said. Responsibility was claimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bhindranwale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of more than a dozen radical groups in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Police said a note left at the scene said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh, was being `` punished'' for extortion and looting, but they gave no details. Eight other people were slain in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, including four Hindus in <LOCATION> Dallin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. A retired Sikh police constable identified as <PERSON> Gajjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was shot to death in <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and two Hindu men were pulled from a truck and shot down in <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, the news agency reported. Both districts are in central <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. A group of Sikh militants riding a jeep sprayed bullets at a bus terminus in <LOCATION> Hoshiarpur </LOCATION> killing six people on the spot, police in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> said. The identitities of the victims were not immediately known. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government has been trying to stem the violence since last May, when it removed the state administration and put <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> under federal rule. On March 4, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered five Sikh high priests released from jail in an apparent effort to get them involved against terrorism. He dissolved the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION> two days later, paving the way for militants to compete in anticipated elections. There have been no signs, however, that priests and other Sikh leaders will move against the radicals.

 More than 25,000 people were taken into police custody Monday as authorities moved to block a nationwide strike to protest corruption and official incompetence, officials said. Nine opposition parties, including the communists, have scheduled the strike for Tuesday to protest government corruption, failure to halt secterian violence and to demand better facilities for farmers and farm laborers. Police in the southern state of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> took 25,000 people into custody to halt violence during the strike, a police officer in state capital of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> said. UNI reported that 500 people were arrested in the eastern <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> state. It said state governments across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> deployed additional security forces Monday to guard important installations and to maintain law and order. Besides the two communist parties, the major sponsor of the strike is the `` Jan Morcha'' or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of disgruntled members of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s govering <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> party. The parties have accused the government of failure to contain Sikh separatist violence in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> where 450 people were killed by suspected Sikh radicals this year. Radical Sikhs want to seceede from the Indian union and turn the state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> into an independent Sikh nation. Opposition leaders have also accused <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of shielding members of his party from corruption inquiries involving foreign arms deals.

<TEXT>
 The government banned more than 800,000 cars and taxis from the downtown commercial district Monday to combat the city's acrid, eye-stinging smog. Hundreds of policemen were stationed along three central arteries that form a triangle around the city's main shopping zone, blocking 45 streets. The ban is part of a campaign started in January to disperse a thick brown cloud known as the `` Nefos'' that hangs over the city. Scientists have blamed it on emissions from cars, diesel-powered taxis and aging buses. The cloud forms over the mountain-ringed <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> basin when there are sudden changes in temperature, and pollutants are trapped in a still layer of air near the ground. Under the new rules, trucks will be allowed in the downtown commercial district for four hours in the morning and 2 -LCB- hours in the afternoon to resupply shops. The area's 100 permanent residents were issued special permits for their vehicles. Police Lt. <PERSON> Panayiotis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stathatos </PERSON>, in charge of applying the measures, said there was a total traffic ban on 14 streets and a partial ban on 31 streets from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. `` So far, we've had about a 60 percent success rate. A lot of drivers still do n't know what streets have been blocked to traffic, so we are showing a little lenience to violators,'' he said. Drivers face an $ 85 fine for illegally entering the one square-mile district near Constitution Square. Another measure already in force bans half the city's private cars and half its 15,000 taxis from entering the 5-square-mile inner city area on alternate days. Vehicles circulate there according to the last digit on their license plates. As part of the pollution-cutting campaign, the government has also abolished the traditional afternoon siesta in favor of a continuous workday for stores and ordered strict checks on industrial emissions. At least one group opposed Monday's ban. `` It's created a mess. It was taken quickly, spasmodically and without sound planning,'' said <PERSON> Panaghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavrides </PERSON>, vice-president of the 1,600-member <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The latest traffic restrictions will last through May, when their effects will be evaluated.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended on Monday that the Star Wars anti-missile program has progressed more rapidly than first thought and accused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of being `` irresponsible in the extreme'' for cutting the budget of the futuristic defense plan. Marking the fifth anniversary of his announcement that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would develop a space-based shield against nuclear missiles, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened an administration drive to assure that Star Wars, as the Strategic Defense Initiative is known, survives beyond his presidency. Even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sent his last budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he pledged in an address to a group of scientists and business executives that SDI will continue its phased deployment. `` We will continue to research SDI, to develop and test it, and as it becomes ready, we will deploy it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vowed. The president renewed charges that without <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be at the mercy of an advanced Soviet space-weapons program. `` A recent report by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> called ` The Soviet Space Challege' warns that the Soviet space program points in one disturbing direction ... the methodical pursuit of a war-fighting capability in space,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has made cuts for the past four years in administration SDI requests, `` We would be dangerously unprepared,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded a recent round of SDI tests in which a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket released a satellite, as well as dummy and decoy warheads, into space. The satellite then tracked the objects, attempting to tell the mock warheads from the decoys _ an essential task of any anti-missile system. SDI is envisioned to be a combination of ground - and space-based weapons using lasers and other exotic technology `` Some of the difficulties they said were insurmountable have already been surmounted, much more rapidly and effectively than anticipated,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding that the test `` showed a technical ability that some scientists ... had said could not be achieved so quickly.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that congressional curbs on administration SDI budget requests have `` set the program back one to two years.'' In the last fiscal year, the administration sought $ 5.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allowed only $ 3.6 billion. Opponents of the program argue that it will cost untold billions and add to the nation's burgeoning deficits. Others contend it is technically unfeasible and will encourage the Soviets to abandon arms control efforts and increase their offensive weapons in order to defeat <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defensive systems. `` There's been a tendency by some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to discuss SDI as if its funding could be determined purely by domestic considerations, unconnected to what the Soviets are doing,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` That is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme.'' The president argued that `` some in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' have denied additional funds `` because they say SDI wo n't work. Well, it wo n't if we do n't develop it and test it.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should realize that it is no longer a question of whether there will be a SDI program or not. The only question will be whether the Soviets are the only ones who have strategic defenses while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains entirely defenseless,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign comes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has placed constraints on SDI testing and expenditures, and as Soviet arms control negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> attempt to crimp the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort amid negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by half. Capitol Hill banned the use of federal funds for any SDI tests that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. But Pentagon officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, have said no such tests are panned for the near future. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has argued that the ABM Treaty forbids research, testing and development of an SDI system. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has insisted on a `` broad'' interpretation of the treaty that would permit expanded SDI tests and development. The U.S.-Soviet contest over Star Wars sparked the breakdown in arms control negotiations between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> summit in 1986. At their last meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the two agreed to disagree for a time on the issue, saying in a joint communique they would observe the ABM Treaty `` as signed in 1972, while conducting their research, development and testing as required.''

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a final bid Monday to drain <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary support from favorite son <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, saying that a brokered convention might bring disaster for their party in the fall. Sen. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, short on funds and far behind in the delegate chase, has said he is on the ballot in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> because he wants to play a role at a brokered Democratic National Convention next summer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Citing published polls, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed `` significant gains'' in recent days in his bid to catch <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and a second favorite son in the race, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But his aides sent conflicting signals about his likely finish in Tuesday's election. Spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said anything better than third place was unlikely. But <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakalis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> campaign chairman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said it was `` very possible'' the governor might slip into second place behind <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> falling into third. From the moment he began his campaign day with an early morning commuter train ride in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke out against a brokered convention.

Still, there was no doubt that the governor's criticism was aimed at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in third place in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> polls, but some surveys show front-runner <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> dropping with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> challenging him for the lead and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moving up to a closer third-place position. The same surveys indicate that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is drawing his last-minute support from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s supporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides say privately they would be delighted to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, believing it would drive the senator from the race.

 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said Monday he has no plans for his Democratic presidential bid beyond his home state primary, which he said `` I have to win and I will win.'' `` A strong second is n't very strong,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said as he greeted suburban commuters in the bitter cold at a downtown train station. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said if he finishes second in the popular vote or in the selection of delegates, `` I'd have to re-evaluate.'' `` I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who was joined by his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON>. `` I have to win and I will win.'' `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- and I will be the No. 1 and No. 2 finishers tomorrow, but the biggest competition is <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because of the huge amount of money he is spending,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> acknowledged that his `` finances are not great,'' but added, `` We have matching fund money that's coming in ... that will take care of our bank loans.'' He would not put a dollar figure on how much is left in campaign coffers. In a speech later in the day before a labor group in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> declined to explain his plans to re-evaluate in the event of a home-state defeat. `` I'm not going to go down that path,'' he told a crowd of about 100 local labor leaders. `` We're gon na win this thing.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> insisted he is still a major force, despite having less than a tenth of the delegates of each of the Democratic front-runners. `` There are a lot of delegates yet to be chosen. At the convention there should be five of us with blocks of delegates,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who is counting on a brokered convention. He said his blueprint for victory at a brokered convention is winning <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, then collecting delegates in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and appealing to labor, educators and senior citizens to put togther a coalition to win the nomination. `` It's going to be a wide-open convention,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told the labor hall crowd, who interrupted his 15-minute speech several times with applause.

 Two white students linked to an attack on two black students have been banned from living on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> campus, a spokeswoman said Monday. Punishment was handed down late last week for three of the five white students accused in the Feb. 7 attack of two black men who accompanied a white woman to a party. The beatings kicked off a six-day takeover of a university building last month by minority students. Two of the five students, whose names were withheld by the university, had withdrawn from the university before disciplinary hearings. Those two were evicted from their dormitory rooms by officials Feb. 13 during a preliminary hearing. Of the remaining three students, two were found guilty of violating the university's rules on assault and all three were found to have violated the university's rules on drinking. All three were ordered to undergo an alcohol education program and two were placed on disciplinary probation for the rest of this school year and the 1988-89 school year, said school spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. Lawyers for the students were out of their offices Monday and could not be reached for comment. The students have until March 30 to appeal. Testimony in a show-cause hearing on whether criminal charges should be filed against the five and a sixth man, who was not a student, was to resume Tuesday.

 Pornographic actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who made hundreds of sexually explicit films during a career spanning two decades, has died. He was 43 years old and reportedly had AIDS. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a leading sex film actor of the 1970s and early'80s, died at 1 a.m. Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sepulveda </LOCATION>, said his manager, adult film producer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON>. The cause of death was not immediately known, <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> said Sunday. The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported earlier this month that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was gravely ill with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The hospital refused to immediately confirm the death. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' death came weeks after police re-questioned him in the unsolved 1981 bludgeoning murders of four people in a <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was acquitted of the murders during a 1982 trial in which jurors cited a lack of corroborating evidence. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> remained in jail for 111 days after the trial for refusing to tell the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Grand Jury what he knew about the slayings. During his incarceration he said his life had been threatened by `` bad people with guns, bad breath and no sense of humor.'' He was released after testifying to the grand jury, but no one else was ever charged in the slayings, which remain unsolved. At the trial, the prosecutor alleged that <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> led the murderers at gunpoint to the house at the orders of a nightclub owner seeking revenge for a robbery. During this year's questioning, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> refused to talk about the case, his attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Egers </PERSON>, said two weeks ago. In his career, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> made hundreds of sexually explicit films and thousands of peep shows. He was most notorious for his portrayal of the character `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadd </PERSON>,'' a detective. He also admitted after his trial that he had a $ 1,000-a-day cocaine habit that took the money he made from porn films. AIDS is transmitted through sex, shared hypodermic needles, tainted blood products and from pregnant women to their babies.

 A robbery suspect who claimed he had AIDS was locked in a patrol car and towed to a police station after he threatened to bite any officer who approached him, authorities said Monday. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 27, was removed from the squad car by police wearing protective gear and taken to <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was seen by doctors in the emergency room and released 20 minutes later, officials said. A hospital spokeswoman said she could not comment on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' condition because of confidentiality restrictions Police said he was classified as emotionally disturbed. AIDS is known to be transmitted through sexual contact, dirty needles, tainted blood, and from mother to fetus. There are no documented cases of the fatal disease being transmitted by biting, said <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The incident involving <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> started Sunday morning, said police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> allegedly grabbed money from a teen-ager's pocket and a fistfight ensued, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. Police arrived, handcuffed <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and put him in the squad car. As the officers interviewed the teen-ager, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, wearing a wig and makeup, `` started cursing and kicking in the rear of the radio car and told the cops he had AIDS and was going to die and would take them with him,'' <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. `` He said he would bite first cop that came near him.'' Police called emergency services officers, who are trained to deal with distraught people, and summoned a tow truck, <PERSON> McConville </PERSON> said. The truck towed the squad car to the police station, where emergency services officers removed <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> faced a charge of attempted robbery, police said.

 Tamil separatists raided a Sinhalese village Monday, killed 11 Sinhalese civilians and seriously injured six others, military officials said. The raid was the latest in a series of attacks on Sinhalese and Tamil civilians by extremists in the northeast section of this island nation. On Friday, 22 Tamils were killed in an attack on a bus. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack took place Monday afternoon on the <LOCATION> Galmetiya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 11 miles south of the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>. `` We blame the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> for this attack and can not give more details,'' one official said. He refused to speculate why the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> may have attacked the village. During the past week, 67 civilians have been killed in revenge slayings in the eastern parts of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. In an attack on a bus and a village, Tamil tigers killed 45 Sinhalese civilians last week in the north eastern <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> district. On Friday, a group of men wearing masks and black uniforms attacked a passenger bus near the <LOCATION> Horawapatans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 28 miles west of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>. Eighteen passengers, all Tamils, were killed and burned in the attack, and four more died in hospitals. Police who arrested 15 Sinhalese men said the bus attack was carried out by Sinhalese extremists avenging earlier killings of Sinhalese citizens. In <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> on Monday, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lankan </LOCATION> police used tear gas to disperse about 2,000 people trying to march in support of a Tamil woman on a fast for peace. Witnesses said about 2,000 men, women and children tried to walk from <LOCATION> Ariampattai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, five miles south east of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, to the Pillaiyar Hindu temple where a 58-year-old Tamil woman has been fasting. <PERSON> Annamma </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who has not eaten since Feb. 19, demands that the Indian government call an unconditional cease-fire and begin negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> rebels to end the fighting.

 The wife of a convicted smuggler testified Monday that she disliked her husband's job with alleged smuggler <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, but wound up as paymaster for his crew. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, is on trial on charges that he and others conspired to smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> from 1978 to 1980. The witness' husband, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, has testified he was the pilot on most of those flights. <PERSON> Emilie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said she met her husband in 1976 and became aware that he was involved in smuggling marijuana before their marriage that summer and confronted him with it. `` He told me he was smuggling marijuana. I did n't like it. I was very much in love with him and he rationalized it,'' she said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> took her into his confidence as his `` what if ` er As he planned his smuggling operations, `` I would say ` what if this happened'?'' she said. All the time, she said she was concerned. `` I was worried about him getting arrested and worried about him being killed,'' she testified., In 1978, she and her husband discussed <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s offer to transport cocaine `` I did n't like it. It was the fear of cocaine. I did n't know anything about it. It did n't seem like what he was doing was safe,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> agreed to make 10 cocaine flights for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, but she said he quickly became disenchanted. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who was very organized, had to deal with uncertain time schedules and that <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was n't following the safety measures that <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> insisted upon, she said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Denies Texas Stay In Suit Against USDA</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lost another round Monday in its battle to keep <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus out of the state when a federal judge refused to block those shipments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> said he needed more time to study the state's request for a stay of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> decision lifting a ban on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus to other producing states. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sought the stay until its suit against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Ricdard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> could be heard. The state sued <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> on Wednesday, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> of violating the Adminstrative Procedures Act when it lifted the 3 -LCB- - year quarantine on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> contends the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> did not provide an opportunity to comment on the decision as required by law. Monday's hearing was the second time since <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sued <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> that <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> denied the state's request for a stay of the Feb. 11 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> ruling. <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> gave <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> five days to provide its evidence, from which he will make a ruling. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials say they want to keep <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus out of the state because they are not convinced an outbreak of bacterial citrus canker has been controlled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> quarantined fruit from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after the disease was discovered there in August 1984. Canker, which comes in different strains, can cause defoliation of trees, lesions that make the fruit unmarketable and premature dropping of fruit from trees. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, argued taht <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has no standing to sue because a quarantine affecting one industry lacks general importance for the state's population as a whole <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, a growers' organization, has joined the state in its lawsuit. `` We feel like that if we can get a federal court to address whether the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> violated their own administrative procedures, we think we'll prevail,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Prewett </PERSON>, executive vice president of McAllen-based <ORGANIZATION> TCM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McKown </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> suspended shipments of fresh citrus to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> on Friday, pending the outcome of Monday's hearing. `` We feel much encouraged and we're going to commence shipping today fruit from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to the citrus producing states,'' <PERSON> McKown </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s primary interest in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> market is in specialty fruits, such as tangeloes and honey tangerines, he said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials are seeking to at least keep the fruit out of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where the state's $ 65 million industry is concentrated in the three southernmost counties. Last fall, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> published a proposal to lift the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> quarantine, but on Jan. 5 withdrew the proposal after new canker outbreaks were discovered. On Feb. 15, four days after <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> lifted the quarantine, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> imposed an emergency 30-day quarantine on fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus, and set up highway roadblocks. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> overturned the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> quarantine March 1, ruling the federal regulation took precedence. A <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> infested with the aggressive Asiatic strain of canker will remain under quarantine.

 <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools are segregated and local school boundaries hamper integration, an expert witness said Monday as the plaintiff's case in the seven-year-old federal desegregation suit neared a close. `` The schools are racially segregated,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a professor of education at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, armed with a thick black notebook containing results of a lengthy study of the schools, said the boundaries of eight local districts within the countywide district hamper both integration and good education. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> took the stand as testimony resumed following a two-month break. The suit centers on a 1967 state law which consolidated the county schools under a countywide. The complaint by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> alleges that control of student and faculty assignments were retained by the local districts for racial reasons. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> testified on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> which has intervened on behalf of the families of several <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school children in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has completed its case and the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> is expected to wrap up its case by midweek. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is hearing the non-jury trial. The complaint asks that <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> find the local district boundaries unconstitutional and order steps to promote integration. <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> has ruled out busing as a possible remedy. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> testified that about a third of the schools in the county can be identified as black, a third white and a third racially mixed. His guideline for determining a racially identifiable school is whether the black-white student ratio is more than 15 percent different from the black-white mix countywide. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said that of 35 schools that opened as identifiably white schools, 17 are still white. Of the 20 that opened as identifiably black schools, 17 are still black. The system of local district lines means `` you take away good solid educational choices from those who should be making the decisions,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` The boundary becomes the decision.'' `` Educators should be making the decisions where children go to school, not boundaries,'' he added. He said adherence to the local boundaries has meant overcrowding in some county schools while others are n't being used to capacity.

 <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, saying he would lose people's trust `` if I cut and run the first bad news we get,'' said Monday he has no plans to drop his presidential bid after Tuesday's Illinois primary even if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scores another big victory `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said at a news conference He acknowledged the possibility that a candidate might not understand when to get out. `` Now if you're out there and you've been twisting in the wind for six or eight months and you're starting to smell a little, somebody has to cut the rope,'' he said. Still, despite polls showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a lead among Illinois Republicans of up to 34 points over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the senator said, `` We believe the bounce is starting to wear of a bit from Super Tuesday.'' He referred to the effects of last Tuesday when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won 16 primaries to surge far ahead of the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential field. `` I think we've made some inroads,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> when asked about his prospects in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think we've had quite enough time. It's a big state.'' He said a `` realistic estimate'' of his prospects would be 40 percent of the 82 delegates to be elected in the primary. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that when a decision is made about the future of his candidacy `` it will be made by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' To emphasize his determination to fight on, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> planned to campaign Tuesday in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, two of the next battlegrounds in the race. Hammering away at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for refusing to participate in a one-on-one debate, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` Why should somebody who's as far ahead as he is be afraid to stand up and debate issues with somebody he indicated does n't have any leadership ability. `` I think it's a mark of weakness that he's unwilling with this big, big lead he has, to say, sure I'll take on <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> any day of the week. Why should n't he? `` I may be a pushover. But I dare him to try it.'' In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> referred to `` the point where presidential advisers are peddling arms to the ayatollah while others hear no evil, see no evil,'' an obvious reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was asked why he did n't attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more on Iran-Contra, he said, `` If I hit him, I get <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first and then they say, oh, oh, he's out there attacking <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It's pretty hard to reach <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ except by telephone.''

 Presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told hundreds of supporters Monday that he would win the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, and not once did he mention rival Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, whose hometown is only six miles away. `` On the eve of a significant breakthrough in politics in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ... with your help, we the people can win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told about 1,800 cheering backers, an equal mixture of blacks and whites of all ages. `` I tell you, we the people will win.'' According to a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll published Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is in a virtual dead heat with fellow Democrat <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't mention <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in his hour-long speech at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>. Instead, he reiterated that his candidacy represents a `` Rainbow Coalition,'' people of all races and age groups. `` Our hope is sweeping the country,'' he said. `` We're running a poor campaign with a rich message,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Stop drugs. Save jobs. Invest in our children. Peace in the world.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the crowd, on its feet through most of the speech, that the flow of drugs and drug use is the No. 1 problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And he said that if elected president, he'd use the Armed Forces to fight drug trafficking. `` I do n't want communist insurgencies from the left, and drug war lords from the right,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, eliciting cries of, `` Yes sir,'' and, `` Amen.'' `` Let's make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better and keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong.'' Also, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> civil rights leader promoted fair prices for farmers, fair wages for workers, justice and peace. And <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hammered away at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business overseas, taking advantage of cheap labor while driving up unemployment in this country. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> touted his managerial skills, noting that on the Super Tuesday campaign he spent only $ 100,000 in advertising, compared with his challengers who spent millions. `` Once again, little <PERSON> David </PERSON> versus the financial giants,'' he said. `` I'm running the most cost-efficient campaign. I'm getting the most return on my investment,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The poll in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> found 32 percent of the state's Democratic voters supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> while 29 percent backed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and 20 percent favored <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The poll, taken of 500 Democrats likely to vote in Tuesday's primary, has an error margin of plus or minus five percentage points _ making the Jackson-Simon race a dead heat A Sunday Tribune poll had <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> ahead. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reminded the crowd in <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> of the civil rights struggle in the 1960s, and said a black man could be elected president if he cared about all people, as he said he did. `` I know just because you're born in the slum does n't mean the slum is born in you, and you can rise above it,'' he said. `` Pull your weight.

<TEXT>
 British Agriculture Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> on Monday questioned whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration means to end farm subsidies entirely. The administration has said it wants them phased out internationally by the year 2000. It also favors `` decoupling'' of subsidies from the prices farmers get for crops. <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> told reporters that while he favored a substantial reduction in subsidies worldwide, removing them altogether `` is I think a debatable question because after all decoupling itself does involve subsidies and decoupling is in the American negotiating position.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is one of the 12 countries in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating partner on issues of world farm trade. The other members are <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, who is in charge of agriculture for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters recently the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> disagrees with the complete elimnination of subsidies, saying they are needed to preserve small farms. He suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers would not stand for complete elimination either. Others in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> have called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal unrealistic. <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> both have pointed to recent efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to hold down spending on farm supports. According to a study published last Friday by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanderson </PERSON>, formerly in charge of food policy at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in 1986 supporting farm prices cost consumers and taxpayers about $ 30 billion in this country and $ 63 billion in 10 of the Community countries. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> are not included in those figures. <PERSON> MacGregor </PERSON> said he could not estimate the pace at which these costs could be reduced.

 A Soviet launch of an unmanned spacecraft similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle could take place this week, with a crew of two possibly heading into orbit six months later, a knowledgeable expert says. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an advisory scientist for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, quoted unidentified European sources close to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space effort as saying the launch could be Thursday or Saturday, The <ORGANIZATION> Huntsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` The Soviets have said it is ` imminent,''' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who keeps close tabs on the Soviet space program. `` The frequency of reports is climbing very rapidly. It could be late next week. Like any new vehicle, problems can crop up.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has written four books on the Soviet program and publishes the annual Soviet Year in Space. Analysts say the first Soviet reusable shuttle flight will be unmanned, with a totally computerized orbital flight, re-entry and touchdown at a landing strip next to the launch site at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, an employee of the Space and <ORGANIZATION> Rocket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> and a part-time Soviet space analyst, said the Soviet shuttle will be attached to the new heavy-lift rocket named <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, which underwent its first test flight last October. The Soviet shuttle strongly resembles <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle, but while the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> craft has the main liquid fuel engines in the orbiter, the Soviet shuttle main engines are attached to the external fuel tank, <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> said. He said it has small maneuvering thrusters in the tail as well as four jet engines that give it `` go-around'' capability on landing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle glides down without power and must land on the first try.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, playing down suggestions that he is closing in on the Republican presidential nomination, said Monday `` the speculation has gotten ahead of the story.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s imposing lead in delegates, gained in Super Tuesday primaries a week ago, left his opponents wondering where to turn to revive their campaigns.

<HEAD>Trash Scavengers Competing With Recycling Program For Trash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Scavengers are competing with a pilot recycling program by picking up newspapers and cans put out by residents for special collection, officials say. `` It's easy pickings for these scavengers to come along and supplement their income,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a recycling consultant who designed the new program in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` We've got so many people putting -LRB- recyclable -RRB- material out that it's easy to pick up a ton of newspaper in an hour,'' he said. He estimated the program was losing about $ 200 every seven days because the scavengers were helping themselves to about four tons of newspaper weekly. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said the neighborhood program's revenues vary from week-to-week depending on the number of tons collected, hitting a peak of about $ 1,400 per week. So, he estimated that the loss would represent from 15 percent to 20 percent of weekly revenues. `` We've got two different recycling systems converging and it's not bad from a recycling point of view,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said `` But it cuts into the money for the program.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who also is a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 400 recycling businesses, said scavengers operate all ovr the country. `` They're called alley entrepreneurs,'' he said. `` Some of these people have developed shrewd operations. They're not always street people. Some of them are sophisticated business people who are making enough money for a bare living,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has an estimated 1,500 scavengers, he said. They make anywhere from $ 30 to $ 150 a week sifting aluminimu cans, bottles and newspaperes from the 9,000 tons of garbage produced daily in the city, he said. The city's 20 privately run recycling centers pay an average of 40 cents a pound for aluminum and about 2 cents a pound for newspaper or glass, he said. `` Some of -LRB- the scavengers -RRB- drive station wagons or pickup trucks on routes to bars and restaurants to collect aluminum cans and bottles,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. Though scavengers work throughout <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a group of six to eight alley entrepreneurs is taking advantage of the five-week-old recycling program in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> on the city's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, he said. The Beverly program, a city pilot project and one of seven neighborhood recycling programs, has attracted the most participation from residents _ and the most attention from scavengers, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. The Resource Center, a private, non-profit recycling business that runs the Beverly program, says about 60 percent of the neighborhood's residents separate newspapers, aluminum cans and other recyclable material from their garbage and leave it at the curb in special blue boxes. Resource Center drivers pick up the trash daily, if they get there before the alley entrepreneurs. The scavengers usually raid between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, director of the Resource Center. `` One gentleman is a minister at a small church that does n't support him well,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said `` So he's devised a system to recycle materials from his congregation and he also, in his free time, collects out on the streets this way to supplement his income.'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has hired some of the alley entrepreneurs to drive recycling trucks, but others say the do n't want such a formal job <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will adopt a proposed ordinance that would make it illegal for unauthorized persons to take waste set out for special recycling collections. The proposal calls for fining violators from $ 100 to $ 500. `` Trash scavenging is going to be a problem in areas with large low-income populations,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` They're trying to make 10 bucks to make it through to tomorrow. You ca n't fault them for that.''

 The nation's first research center for head injury patients adjusting to their disability will be established at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, school officials said Monday. While four other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> centers treat `` traumatic brain injury'' patients in the hospital, university officials said their center is unique because it will deal with the psychological, practical and social problems of returning to normal life. `` Patients go back with their families, even if they did n't live there before. And now what do you do?'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willer </PERSON>, co-director of the center and associate professor of psychiatry. The center will be funded primarily by a five-year, $ 3 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 2 million more from funding of ongoing research. Recent advances in emergency medical care, stemming from techniques developed largely during the Vietnam War, have increased the number of those suffering from severe brain injuries, <PERSON> Willer </PERSON> said. Years ago people with severe brain injuries would have died. The $ 5 million grant is part of a national push from the federal government to help traumatic brain-injured patients, school officials said. The injury to White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt of Preside would n't have gone after them,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> took the bid seriously. `` You always take him seriously,'' <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> said, adding he did not know if <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s withdrawal was the end of its takeover efforts. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> holds interests in oil and natural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another major gold producer targeted in an earlier, unsuccessful hostile takeover bid by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>.

 President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are hopeful that son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s book describing a troubled childhood and family problems will help others in similar situations, a White House spokeswoman said Monday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 43, has just completed his autobiography, `` On the Outside Looking In,'' to be published by Zebra Books. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, the adopted son of the president said he grew up resentful and `` did n't feel I belonged in so perfect a family.'' `` I've spent my life trying to figure out how to make <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> my friend,'' the younger <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president and first lady read <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s book over the weekend at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, called him Sunday evening to compliment him on it, said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>. `` They thought it was very good, very interesting,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said. The couple told <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> they hoped it would `` help other children who went through the same situation _ molestation _ and help other children adjust to adoption,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. The first lady was referring to a section of the book in which <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> describes how he was molested and photographed in the nude by a day-camp leader when he was seven years old. He had kept the incident secret until last year. The book also contains reports of arguments between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and his stepmother. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> had been concerned that the book might be critical of them, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said that was not the case. `` They said the book was good, and that if you read it all, it comes out balanced,'' the spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was adopted when his father was married to actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>. The couple also had a daughter, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>. After divorcing <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> married actress <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and fathered two other children, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>. In his book, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> relates how he set out last year to find out who his biological mother was and that the president helped by calling the governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` When my father helped me with this, it was the biggest gift he ever gave me. He set me free,'' People magazine quotes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> learned that he was born out of wedlock to <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaugher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, who gave him up at birth in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1945 and later worked as a movie bit player under the name <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. She married an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> restaurateur and had a son, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, and died in 1985. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s half-brother visited him and brought an album their mother had kept that was full of pictures and clippings of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the most wonderful feeling in the world when I found out she knew all along who I was, and that this mother had kept track of this child,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his father had a long talk in January in which <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said he told his father of the feelings of abandonment he suffered as he was growing up. He quoted his father as saying, `` My God, I thought just telling you I loved you was all I had to do.''

<HEAD>Anonymous Tests To Seek AIDS Antibodies in Newborns in 30 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newborn babies in 30 cities will be checked for AIDS antibodies in anonymous tests the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> hopes will provide an early and broader look at who is getting the disease. The tests, to be at selected hospitals, are part of a series of surveys designed to eventually test 1.6 million Americans a year for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Blood samples from the newborns will be sent without names for testing, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said Monday. The study hopes to determine the extent to which AIDS has penetrated heterosexual women of child-bearing age, thought to be a low-risk group. Other programs, some of which are already under way, will test blood samples from sexually transmitted disease clinics, drug clinics, tuberculosis clinics, military recruits, job corps blood donors and others, she said. Some tests will be routine and anonymous while others will be voluntary with confidential results, she said. Early results are expected next fall, and the findings probably will determine which programs are continued, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> is helping finance the programs at a cost of an estimated $ 47 million for fiscal 1988. Some doctors say it violates ethics to test samples from known people without permission and that getting permission would narrow the population being tested. `` This is the least offensive way of getting a reliable general population sample,'' Dr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, chief of surveillance and evaluation for the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program. Others question whether it is ethical not to tell a patient something he or she should know. `` To simply have the results and not have the ability to do something with the results is n't a completely reasonable position, is it?'' asked Dr. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, a pediatrics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Only about half the babies who test positively carry the virus. The others get a dose of antibody proteins from their infected mothers. A positive antibodies test on a baby proves only that the mother carries the virus. Similar tests on 30,000 newborns in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> revealed that one of every 476 women giving birth there was infected. Not all who carry the virus eventually develop AIDS. The newborns will be tested in 20 cities with a high AIDS incidence. They are <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Tests also will be done in the low-incidence cities of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's ability to ward off disease. It is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person, shared hypodermic needles and blood transfusions, and can be passed from mothers to their offspring. There is no known cure. Since June, 1981 there have been 55,167 cases counted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 30,932 patients have died.

<TEXT>
 University of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> officials said Monday they hope to quickly name an interim president to replace <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, who resigned amid controversy about the cost of renovating his official residence and campus office. Meanwhile, Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> withdrew his request for an appropriation of $ 23.1 million to fund <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s program, called `` Commitment to Focus,'' to raise standards at the university while cutting undergraduate enrollment. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said support for the funding had dwindled because of the controversy over the renovations. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, president of the university for three years, met privately with <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> before calling a news conference late Sunday night to announce his departure. `` At no time did I discuss that he resign, absolutely not,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> told a news conference. However, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> he had two options: `` Either leave, or you have a very dramatic plan ... to continue with Focus and get the university back on track.''' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the Board of Regents should consider using a portion of a $ 53 million reserve fund to meet the immediate needs of the quality-improvement program, which the governor said he continues to support. The existence of the reserve fund was revealed last week as a result of audits ordered after news reports raised questions about the renovations. News reports said that $ 1.5 million had been spent to renovate Eastcliff, the university president's mansion, and $ 200,000 was spent remodeling <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s campus office suite. The regents never gave formal approval for the mansion renovation, which was orginally supposed to cost $ 400,000, the legislative auditor's office said. Among the most embarrassing expenditures were those for a mahogany desk and credenza for <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>'s office that the legislative auditor said cost $ 17,445. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> has offered to pay for the office furniture. The university reportedly met the cost overruns by dipping into the reserve fund, which included profits from book stores, parking lots and temporary investments. The audits released last week did not question the legality of the fund, but criticized accounting and reporting procedures. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON>, chairman of the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped an interim president could be named at a special meeting Wednesday. Selection of a permanent replacement could take months. <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON>, who headed a search committee that recommended <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> to be president of the 55,000-student school, pledged continued support for Commitment to Focus. `` All of my life I will be proud that we selected a president who came up with a plan to make this university even better,'' <PERSON> Lebedoff </PERSON> said. Some lawmakers had criticizeed the Focus program as smacking of elitism, and the $ 23.1 million proposed by <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> for the program was $ 12 million less than the university had requested. <PERSON> Legedoff </PERSON> said the regents should have demanded an accounting of the remodeling projects, but added that under existing guidelines the spending should have been reported. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, 53, apologized in his resignation statement Sunday. `` Over the past few weeks, you and I have lived with stories about Eastcliff renovations and repairs,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. `` The stories have not been good ones,'' he said. `` I bear a key responsibility for it. ... I am profoundly embarrassed and profoundly sorry for it.'' The legislative auditor's report said the involvement of <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> and his wife, university attorney <PERSON> Bonita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindelir </PERSON>, in the renovation led to some of the Spending on the mansion was revealed in news media reports in early February. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> annoyed some legislators by going to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on a vacation instead of being available to answer questions about the remodeling. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, came to the university in 1964 as an assistant professor in chemical engineering and materials science, and became a department head in 1979.

<HEAD>Minnesota May Test Students For Understanding Of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is studying a proposal to test students about their understanding of AIDS prevention, but the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is considering action to kill the program. `` There are states doing innovative things in the area of AIDS education, but <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is the first I've heard about that is trying to mandate assessment this way,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, co-director of the AIDS Education Project of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a good idea because it involves an educational program aimed at changing behavior and that's what is really needed to fight AIDS,'' she said. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> commented last week after the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> took the first steps toward requiring students in the sixth and 10th grades to be tested on their knowledge of AIDS prevention. The proposal also would require school districts to teach courses on prevention of AIDS and other communicable diseases in kindergarten through the senior year of high school. The proposal still faces public hearings and the scrutiny of an administrative law judge before taking effect. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> officials say the process will take about 10 months to a year and cost $ 10,000 to $ 20,000. A bill pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> which would block board's plan was passed unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Friday and will be discussed Wednesday before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We disagree on mandating. We think school districts in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have good progams in place, and we'd like to continue to help them do that. Taking the time and money to develop a rule might upset this progress,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, sponsor of the move to block the board's proposal. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> says the school boards association backs mandatory AIDS education because it means local school boards do not have to face as much controversy from people offended by discussion of AIDS. `` They can just say, ` It's the requirement. Let's work on how we can meet it,''' she said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, about 386 <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> school districts say they have some kind of AIDS education, but provide no information on what kind. That means about 50 districts still do n't have any type of AIDS education. Board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Plocker </PERSON>, who prefers a voluntary approach, said the board still wants local school boards to shape their programs. `` We're just telling them they have to do it. There's still a lot of latitude,'' he said

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared Monday `` it's not over'' for his Republican presidential campaign despite indications of a big <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> victory for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but Democrat <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> admitted `` I have no plans beyond tomorrow'' and the home-state primary he needs to win. With five presidential candidates racing around the state in a final day of campaigning, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was buoyed by a poll suggesting he may have pulled even with fellow favorite son <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` On the eve of a significant breakthrough ... with your help, we the people can win <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of about 1,800 in <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I tell you, we the people will win.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, lying third, sought a good enough showing to keep up some momentum from Super Tuesday. Over and over on Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hammered at <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s contention that the Democratic convention will be deadlocked. It `` would be a disaster'' for the Democrats to end the primary process without a nominee-to-be, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, with `` negotiating, dealing, people behind closed doors trying to decide who the nominee ought to be.'' The problem for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was much more immediate than the conventions, months away in the summer. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> was looking for a way to keep his campaign alive in the face of a string of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victories. `` It's not over for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' he told the Executives Club of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Later, at a news conference, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> repeated his determination to continue beyond Tuesday: `` I've made a judgment that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, whatever happens, we're going to keep going.'' The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said he had `` made some inroads'' against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but that there had not been enough time to stop <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surge after a 16-state win last Tuesday. `` You want to elect momentum or elect the better candidate?'' he asked the Executives Club audience. `` Maybe it's going to take a couple of weeks for everything to sort of slow down.'' But the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> outlook for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was not good. A <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the choice of 62 percent of the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with only 28 percent for <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Such a strong showing could give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a big chunk of the 82 Republican delegates at stake in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Added to his current total of 705 delegates, it could give him more than 60 percent of the 1,139 needed to win the nomination at the GOP National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has 165. Despite the numbers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a reporter that suggestions he has locked up the nomination are premature. `` I feel the speculation has gotten ahead of the story,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he flew on Air Force Two from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, Ill. However, when asked if he were surprised that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was staying in the race, he replied: `` I'm not sure I understand what he's doing.'' On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was facing the reality that he has to win the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary to keep even his stripped-down campaign alive until the Democratic National Convention in July. `` I have no plans beyond tomorrow,'' he said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I have to win and I will win. But obviously <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> come next.'' And second place is n't good enough. `` A strong second is n't very strong,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a reporter. If he does end up in second place in either delegates or the popular vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he said, `` I'd have to reevaluate.'' One poll published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> suggested <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> faces the possibility of a second-place finish. The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, said 32 percent of likely Democratic voters supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 29 percent backed <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and 20 percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> was the choice of 5 percent and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had the backing of 4 percent. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, interviewed 500 people and had a potential margin of error of 5 percentage points. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday and published Monday in the newspaper, gave <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> the lead with 39 percent support to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 34 percent among very likely Democratic voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 17 percent with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> far behind. The potential sampling error was plus or minus 6 percentage points. Going into the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held the lead in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> delegate count, with 463 to 424 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> had 353 and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> just 36. A total of 173 delegates are at stake on the Democratic side in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. One <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> goal is to win some of those delegates, a difficult task given the complicated nature of the state's ballot. Voters not only cast ballots for presidential candidates, they also vote directly for delegate candidates. Thus, a vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the `` beauty contest'' portion does not necessarily mean a vote for him in the delegate selection process. Another goal, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said privately, is to narrow the Democratic field. Mentioning the polls showing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drawing his last-minute support from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s voters, the governor's aides said they would be delighted to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, believing it would drive the senator from the race.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was always successful: a violin player with the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>, a tennis star in college, onetime national surfing champion. Later, he became famous as <PERSON> Murph </PERSON> the Surf: playboy, jewel thief, murderer. Now, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> calls himself a `` frontline Christian soldier,'' an ex-convict who has `` dedicated the rest of my life to the Lord.'' `` I've got what they call chain-gang religion, jailhouse religion, and it's easy for people to scoff at it,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said during a recent interview at The Bridge, a prison work-release facility in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 50, said he has traveled more than 100,000 miles to counsel prisoners and has given his Christian testimony at hundreds of schools and churches. He was paroled in November 1986 after 19 years in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prisons. One of the conditions of his release was that he spend his time helping others by preaching and teaching. Many are watching and judging, he knows. They remember that it was <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> who stole the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, a 563-carat sapphire, in a spectacular heist from the Museum of Natural History in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1964, along with a 100-carat ruby and 20 other gems. They remember too that he was convicted of murder in the 1967 slayings of two women whose bludgeoned bodies were found dumped in <LOCATION> Whiskey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, a tidal waterway between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the two women were killed over $ 488,000 worth of negotiable securities they stole from their employer. `` There will always be critics or skeptics who do n't believe in born-again experiences,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` But I guarantee it happens and has happened to me.'' Those he works with believe in him and his work. `` His goal is to help prisoners come to Christ,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crossley </PERSON>. `` He wants to help fight crime and wage war on drugs. I believe churchgoers should support <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s ministry. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainwater </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Youth for Christ, echoes <PERSON> Crossley </PERSON>'s statements. `` I've heard nothing but real good reports on <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> since he has been paroled,'' <PERSON> Rainwater </PERSON> said. `` He has been a good representative of the Christian community.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he is just starting. `` I have a number of mentors who have been down the road before. Good Christians. Prison chaplains. People who care about people. `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> told us to represent him in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. My <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is in the jails... The jails are the places I least want to be. But it's there I believe God wants me to be. It is where he allowed me to grow up.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> married <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who visited him in prison for 12 years, last December. She frequently travels with him on speaking engagements. He is sometimes paid by groups that ask him to speak. Other income comes from the sale of paintings he did while in prison. `` I do n't have wealth. I do n't have material things. I go from month to month, but God provides,'' he said. `` I never could have imagined the peace, quality and joy of such a life.'' To those who doubt or scoff, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` If you do n't believe me, just watch me.''

 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, campaigning against long odds in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' Democratic primary, looked ahead Monday to the rest of the Northern industrial states and said he would `` compete everywhere and look for an opportunity to punch through'' with a victory. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator flew around <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in a final day of campaigning before Tuesday's primary, repeatedly describing himself as the alternative to rivals <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He said he was encouraged about prospects in the state despite polls showing him stuck in single digits behind the others in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` The polls have been wrong quite frequently in this race because the voters are thinking for themselves,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> began his day at a factory gate in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, where he stood coatless in a light snowfall and greeted workers during a shift change before flying to <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>. Speaking to reporters aboard his chartered airplane, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said that regardless of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> outcome he saw the race for the Democratic nomination as a battle between himself, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that would be fought out in industrial states during the spring. `` We've got a whole series of contests between now and June 7,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` We're going to compete in all of them.'' Needing a victory to to demonstrate appeal outside his native South, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said he saw `` a number of opportunities for a win,'' naming <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` We're looking at the primary schedule,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` We're going to compete everywhere and look for an opportunity to punch through. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> strategist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the campaign's aim in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was to be `` in the fray.'' He said the campaign had bought `` a decent or modest amount'' of television airtime in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and did not dispute estimates putting the figure in the $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 range over the past week. `` I think we're going to do better than people expect here,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I think there are an awful lot of voters here in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who want an alternative to the kind of approach offered by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` I offer a different kind of approach.'' In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, he said each of those three rivals represents `` the same old formula'' that has led the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to lose four out of the past five presidential elections. In <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> tractor manufacturing company, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` has not been willing to use the tools'' available under current trade laws to ensure fairness by foreign competitors. He also said that `` a majority of the problems identified in the trade deficit are here at home,'' citing massive federal borrowing and saying there was a need to improve education and economic policy. In <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> toured a small homeless shelter and visited with a mother and her baby who live there, underscoring his call for more federal assistance to the homeless. He said much of the increase in homelessness was due to `` slashes'' in housing programs under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. At an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> post in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Sunday night and again in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, faced questions about men left behind after that war. He drew praise from other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans when he promised to `` pursue to the ends of this earth'' any remaining leads on such men. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> stood before a Cray super computer and accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of `` the starvation of super computing'' through denial of federal support for civilian computer research. He called for more federal money to support development of computer technology and the linking of super computers _ systems capable of performing millions of computations in an instant _ into a nationwide network. Pointing to one of the rare super computers, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> referred to the confused Democratic presidential race and said: `` If there's a brokered convention, this is a possibility.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Aims To Pick Up Uncounted Delegates; Jackson Closing In</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is within striking distance of leading the Democratic race for national convention delegates, but <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the leader in the field, is planning to pick up delegates from yet uncounted caucuses. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is favored in some polls to win his home state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in Tuesday's primary, could still wind up losing when the delegate prize is divided. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led the Democratic presidential field with 462.5 delegates, followed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 423.55. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign said he stands to gain at least another 100 delegates when caucus results from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> are finally tabulated. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign said that the rules in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> do not favor him in picking up many delegates from his home state. `` If we get as high a percentage of delegates as we do the popular vote that would be a smashing success,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobble </PERSON>, who monitors delegate selection for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> holds a direct-election primary in which slates of delegates are elected from the ballot. Presidential candidates are also listed on a `` beauty contest'' section of the ballot, but the results have no effect on picking the delegates. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign does not expect to pick up the nearly 40 delegates needed to overtake <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the national count, Cobble said. At stake in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are 173 delegates. Two recent polls show favorite sons, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, neck-and-neck in the contest. In a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> poll, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> edged <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 32 percent to 29 percent, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> held a slim lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ 39 percent to 34 percent _ in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll. But the percentages separating them were within the polls' potential margins of sampling error <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who needs to win in his home state to keep his political hopes alive, had 35.5 delegates. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was third behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 352.8 delegates, while <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was in fourth place with 145 delegates. Uncommitted delegates totaled 275.65 delegates.

 <PERSON> Nisrin </PERSON>'s mother, two sisters and three brothers are dead. The 3-year-old and her father, one leg blown away, are all the family left after 25 missiles fell on this town in a storm of explosion and fire. <PERSON> Nisrin </PERSON>'s head was wrapped in blood-stained bandages Monday. Her father <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, 54, also lay in the <LOCATION> Sulaimaniya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, his right leg missing. Both were unconscious as neighbors buried the six family members and nine other people killed by the rain of short-range missiles Sunday on <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>. More missiles fell on nearby <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>. The attack marked resumption of the latest round in the `` war of the cities,'' which took hundreds of lives in the 12 days from its beginning Feb. 29 until both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> called it off temporarily last Friday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> retaliated for the short-range missiles by launching a rocket into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> like scores of others it had fired into the Iranian capital since the duel began. Reporters were flown to <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> on a tour organized by the government to publicize the damage caused by the attacks on population centers. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the cities since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> went to war in September 1980. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, a resident, said the town `` enjoyed two quiet nights'' before Sunday's barrage. He said the 70,000 people who live there had no time to run to shelters because the missiles came suddenly and continued for an hour. An army officer pointed to a mountain in the distance and said: `` This is the border.'' He said the Iranians had set up a new missile position just beyond it. <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Barazanchi </PERSON>, the regional governor, said a `` mass evacuation'' of <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>'s population was being considered. Mourners demanded revenge, not evacuation. About 10,000 people marched Monday behind 15 coffins draped in <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> flags, chanting slogans against <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary patriarch. At the cemetery they shouted `` Death to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>!'' and waved a banner reading: `` Fire more <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missiles on the criminals in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in revenge for our people.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has given its long-range missiles the name <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, for a Shiite Moslem saint, and claims to have developed them itself. Western military analysts say the missiles are Soviet-made Scud-Bs with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, nearly 300 miles from the border.

 The Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling Monday to extradite to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> a former major and his wife accused of kidnapping two children born to mothers held during the `` dirty war.'' The couple's lawyer, <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustaller </PERSON>, told reporters he will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The Roman Catholic radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> said former Maj. <PERSON> Atilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehrli </PERSON> face charges filed by the Grandmothers of the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> group of abducting a boy and girl and falsifying their birth papers during <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s `` dirty war'' of 1976-83. The children, <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 12, and <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON>, 10, were quoted this month in the independent daily newspaper <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> as saying they do n't want to be separated from the major and his wife `` We do n't know anything about those supposed parents we have in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' the children were quoted as saying. The Grandmothers group says <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, a bone doctor at a military hospital in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, abducted the children shortly after their birth and falsified the attending physician's signature to make them appear to be his and his wife's offspring. Neighbors say Ms. <PERSON> Wehrli </PERSON> was not pregnant at those times. At least 9,000 people suspected of being leftist subversives were abducted by military and paramilitary agents and vanished without a trace during what became known as the `` dirty war'' under military rule in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, officials say. Human rights group say the number is closer to 30,000. The Grandmothers group, an offshoot of the Mothers of the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> group that includes relatives who lost loved ones in the `` dirty war,'' says 72 of the 182 children taken from their parents were recovered.

 An <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> businessman identified as the Drug Enforcement Agency's No. 1 heroin target has been arrested and charged with importing 1,000 pounds of heroin from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> over three years, authorities said Monday. The drug ring run by <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-Leung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> was much larger than those in such well-known heroin smuggling cases as the French Connection or the Pizza Connection, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The French Connection involved 70 pounds of heroin, the Pizza Connection about 200, he said. Heroin trafficking `` is now controlled by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ethnic groups that are bringing in vast amounts to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in amounts far more than any of us who have been professionals in the field ever thought possible,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said federal authorities lured <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he was arrested Sunday night in front of the New York Hilton Hotel. The 44-year-old <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> was charged under an indictment handed up in December. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> refused to give details of the arrest. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said that although <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> is charged with importing 1,000 pounds of heroin, it is believed he is responsible for bringing in twice that amount. The heroin was smuggled into the country from 1984 to 1987 through various means, including suitcases and shipments of vases, ice buckets, T-shirts and wall plaques, said <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. Couriers then carried millions of dollars in proceeds back to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to be laundered, authorities said. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> allegedly used $ 20 million to buy commercial real estate in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and later moved to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, had numerous businesses in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including several fur companies. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> had eluded arrest by becoming `` an international gypsy'' and moving between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> had at least six phony passports, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. Authorities confiscated 570 pounds of heroin alleged to have been imported by <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s organization in several seizures over the years, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. Authorities also arrested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officer, at his <LOCATION> Mountclair </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home Sunday night. <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON>, 50, was allegedly responsible for picking up the heroin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, usually at the Hilton, for distribution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He gathered the drug money and arranged its return to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, according to authorities. <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON> worked with <PERSON> Kon </PERSON> before leaving the force in 1981, authorities said. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Routollo </PERSON> supplied weapons to <PERSON> Kon </PERSON>'s organization through his position in the Police Department's office of pistols and licenses

 The Army went public on Monday with a classified program to improve the armor on its main battle tank, announcing that it was starting to build the M-1A1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> with depleted uranium in the armor plating. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who requested anonymity said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials were convinced the new uranium-laced plates were so much stronger than conventional steel that they could stop all types of ammunition used by Soviet tank guns. The Army insisted that the depleted uranium would pose no threat to either the soldiers who operated the tanks or to the production workers who built them because of the manner in which the tanks would be fabricated. `` The armor design modification to the M-1A1 incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` Sealed within the tank, depleted uranium has a very low level of natural radiation, which is well within the acceptable range established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.'' The service said it had begun on Monday briefing the roughly 5,000 production workers who assemble the tanks about the new modifications. The <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is made for the Army by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at two plants _ in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. While attempting to alleviate fears about radiation, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> made clear that it attached a high priority to building the new version of the M-1A1. Production is starting immediately, the service said, and the new armor `` represents a significant enhancement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional defense capabilities.'' `` This improvement culminates several years of research and development to meet recent and continuing improvements in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact anti-armor weapons and will allow the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. Maj. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the new armor plating now going into production would begin showing up on the tank manufacturing lines early this summer. The first completed tank with the new armor should be delivered in October, the spokesman added. <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> declined to say where the armor plating was being produced or to discuss the extent to which conventional armor plates are strengthened by incorporating depleted uranium. Depleted uranium is an inert, heavy metal that is unusually dense. The term `` depleted'' means the uranium does not have sufficient energy to be used for commercial purposes such as in a power plant. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are already using depleted uranium to fashion certain types of ammunition. In the case of the M-1A1, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how much uranium would be incorporated into each tank; where on the tank body the armor with uranium would be located, or how it would produce the new armor. Service officials who asked not to be named, however, said the new process involved `` weaving'' a thread mesh of uranium into the regular steel armor plating at the time of casting. `` While depleted uranium has a low level of natural radiation, our tests have confirmed that this material _ as installed in the <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> _ will involve no appreciable health threat,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You would receive less radiation sitting on the surface of the tank than you would receive when flying during a trans-Atlantic flight. Because of this low exposure, no special precautions are required when near the tank.'' The Army has already acquired about 1,500 M-1A1's and they will not be retrofitted with the new armor, the service said. But the remaining 3,000 tanks scheduled for purchase will incorporate the new armor, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> added. `` The majority of the improved tanks will be stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where they can most directly contribute to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defenses,'' the service said. The first should arrive `` late this year.''

<HEAD>Senators To House: Drop Gephardt Trade Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on Monday called on their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counterparts to drop Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s heavily debated amendment from their sweeping trade bill. `` We decided to stick with our own Super 301 plan and to oppose the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said as he emerged from a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee members. The move, which came on a voice vote in the closed-door meeting, could set the stage for the gradual erasure of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> presents a compromise counteroffer to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that makes a substantial change in the wording. However, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action represents `` nothing new. `` We've known the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bargaining position for eight months,'' he said. `` It in no way reflects a decision by the conference committee. It's merely an opening bargaining position. We're confident that whatever emerges from conference will be new, forceful legislation to open foreign markets. And clearly the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment paved the way.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan would require negotiations to reduce Japanese and other nations' `` excess and unwarranted'' trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If that failed, it would prescribe presidential action to cut the surpluses by 10 percent a year. Such a move could include tariffs or import quotas on Japanese goods imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the president could refuse to act, either to uphold `` national economic security'' or if the other country were wrestling with a serious international debt problem. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has criticized the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> plan as being likely to hurt consumers, cost more jobs than it would save and invite retaliation against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. The administration also has been critical of the `` Super 301'' provision that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is pushing. `` Super 301,'' named for the section of the Trade Act calling for retaliation against overseas barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, would require the president to act to eliminate all of the unfair foreign trade barriers listed on an inventory to be drawn up by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was not immediately sent to the House. Instead, the senators planned to return to the bargaining table on Tuesday and fashion additional provisions involving steps to combat `` dumping,'' or selling foreign-made products in world markets at prices lower than those in home markets. They also planned to work on provisions involving countervailing duties, or tariffs that are imposed to offset the price advantage that some foreign-mad products get from export subsidies in their home countries. The senators also eased some of the provisions in the portion of their 1,000-page bill calling for retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices. They moved to expand from seven months to 12 months the time for the president to make a determination as to whether a foreign trade practice should be considered unfair. And they acted to remove some of the specific reasons for retaliation from the bill itself and put them instead in a report that will accompany the legislation.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Monday that ethnic minorities stirring unrest in his vast country are raising old grievances but not challenging the authority of the Communist government. Soon after arriving on Monday in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which has a long history of its own nationality problems, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked about recent demonstrations and ethnic riots in the southern Soviet republics. `` Show me the country in which there are no such problems,'' the Communist Party chief replied. `` If you show me, I will travel there right away, without stopping in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on return from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is on a five-day visit, is the first Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> since the death of President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> in May 1980. Referring to recent demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and rioting in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> between ethnic <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> and Armenians that left more than 30 people dead, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the problems had been brewing for a long time. He acknowledged some tensions between ethnic groups have been neglected in his nation of more than 100 nationalities, but said the protesters were not questioning socialist rule or `` challenging our political line.'' The remarks were his first personal comments on the situation in the Soviet south, although a statement in his name was read to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> demonstrators. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s northernmost republic, and the Croatian city of <LOCATION> Dubrovnik </LOCATION>. Missing from his itinerary is <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which is beset by strife between the Albanian majority and Slavic minority. Late Monday, after touring memorials and monuments, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began talks with President <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s party. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s assistant foreign minister, <PERSON> Ilija </PERSON> <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON>, briefed reporters later. He said national minorities were not raised as a separate topic, but that in a general discussion on social developments, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed the difficulty of resolving ethnic problems. <PERSON> Djukic </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying, `` There are no problems that could be solved once and for all, that conditions change, that everything requires improvement.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, set an informal pace Monday as they took their first look at a Communist country that has implemented some of the economic reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposes _ but with mixed results. The Soviet leader made an unscheduled stop in a busy downtown square and left his armored limousine to shake hands and chat with pedestrians. A witness said he picked up a child and gave it a kiss. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to take a walk through downtown <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> but was nearly overwhelmed by several hundred people pressing for a closer look. The Gorbachevs placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier atop <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avala </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. On the way down the mountain, their limousine made an unannounced stop at a monument in the shape of a broken airplane wing that marks the site of a Soviet air disaster. On Oct. 19, 1964, a plane carrying former Soviet soldiers who helped liberate <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> 20 years earlier crashed there, killing all aboard. The <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> left two small bouquets. At one point, a reporter asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> if there was progress at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks on the Afghan conflict. With a smile, he said `` There is,'' and `` There will be,'' but did not elaborate. He has pledged to withdraw all Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ estimated at 115,000 _ in less than a year if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks produce a settlement. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> to give `` new impulses'' to the friendly relationship between the countries. Yugoslav officials have said a principal topic of discussion will be <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic system of `` self-managed, market socialism.'' It also allows for private initiative along lines similar to cooperative enterprises that have sprung up in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under new laws. The Yugoslav system was developed by <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, who broke with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in 1948 on ideological grounds and pursued his own communist course. While maintaining relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he was a founder of the non-aligned movement and developed ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> enjoyed a long economic boom, but has encountered hard times in recent years. Today, the government and party are struggling with annual inflation of 170 percent, 15 percent unemployment and a $ 20 billion debt to Western creditors. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to end stagnation in the Soviet economy by encouraging more accountability by management and more local control of production. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Loginov </PERSON> told reporters the Soviets are studying Yugoslav economic reforms.

 <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a self-styled reformer who toppled a political legend, was inaugurated governor Monday and challenged the people of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to help him `` clean up our politics.'' The 44-year-old Democrat, who won a runoff concession from Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> on Oct. 24, took the oath of office from former Sen. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the son of legendary Gov. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, shortly after noon on the Capitol steps. He takes office amid fiscal crisis, with an accumulated budget deficit and cash shortfall of as much as $ 1.2 billion, much of it due to the oil patch depression. `` Do we have the character to clean up our politics, to free our political leadership from the stranglehold of the special interests?'' asked the former four-term congressman. `` From the governor's mansion to the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to the local government, I say we do.'' `` I will lead, but I need you to pick me up when I fall,'' said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 51st governor. `` I need you to stand beside me when the special interests attack.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who served as governor from 1972 to 1980 and returned for a third term in 1984, was occupied for much of his last administration defending himself successfully against federal racketeering charges. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, during an inaugural address to some 5,000 people, did not cite the usual litany of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s problems, including high unemployment, teen pregnancies, high school dropouts and nearly-empty state coffers. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was interrupted frequently by applause, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> included. `` I'm going hunting tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told reporters. `` It's his now. The state's unemployment rate hit 12 percent in January, one of the highest in the nation, due primarily to the long downturn in the oil and gas industry. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s schools are under challenge, business interests are demanding an overhaul of the tax system to attract industry and environmental groups are calling for tougher regulations to protect the air and water. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> campaigned on calls for major reforms in those areas and others, including campaign financing. He said recently that the challenge is unlike that facing any other <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> governor. `` I've got to do both to get us out of debt and build _ education development, economic development, better environment. It's going to be a difficult and interesting job,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. As solutions for the state's budget problems, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> had proposed a statewide lottery and casino gambling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is opposed to both. `` We are not going to raise taxes or change taxes until we cut this budget,'' said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. `` It is out of control.'' Even before his inauguration, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> won two key victories in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as his candidates for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president were elected during organizational meetings by lawmakers. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said earlier that a change in the legislative leadership was needed to give his ambitious programs a fair hearing by lawmakers. Before <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was sworn in, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, a Republican, took the oath from former Gov. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> defeated Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> in a runoff last fall. Other top state officials, all Democrats, also were sworn. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, his wife, three children and his parents started inauguration day with a worship service at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Young Anti-Drug Lawyer Wins Bogota Mayoral Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A young lawyer who is the son of a former president and was kidnapped for campaigning against drugs has won the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> mayor's office in the first mayoral elections in Colombian history. Security for Sunday's voting was tight throughout <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where violence by extremist political factions and powerful narcotics traffickers is common. An alleged leader of the biggest drug organization even tried to run for city council in the town of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> failed because Colombian law demands that candidates register in person. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is in jail in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, facing drug charges there and in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, 34, son of former President <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, won the mayoralty election in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and will be one of the youngest men to hold the office, which often has been a stepping stone to the presidency. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> is a rising star in the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and his election was a setback for President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s governing Liberals. He was the only Conservative running for mayor in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, but feuding factions in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ran a total of three candidates. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> got 324,801 votes and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caicedo </PERSON>, Liberal former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businessmen </ORGANIZATION>, finished second with 236,212. Voters heeded <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s call to fight bullets with ballots in the first election of mayors. For 169 years the president, always from either the Liberal or Conservative parties, had appointed governors who in turn chose the mayors. Colombians elected 1,008 mayors Sunday. They also chose city councils, state legislatures and governing bodies for remote territories with too few people to become states. By late Sunday night the elections office said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had won 405 of the races for mayor, Conservatives 379 and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> 13. Coalition candidates representing several parties won 104 of the mayoral contests, the elections office said. Results were not yet in from remote areas. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said in a speech televised Saturday night that voting would be a way to reject the violence. More than 1,700 people were killed in the past year in fighting between leftist guerrillas and government security forces and by right-wing death squads and drug traffickers. On Sunday, soldiers and police guarded voting places and patrolled cities and towns. The election campaign was one of the bloodiest ever in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, with leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads killing five mayoral candidates and 19 city council candidates. Hundreds of other political activists were slain. Leftist guerrillas kidnapped 14 mayors in the two weeks before the election, then freed them after telling each to do more for the poor. <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, who called for stronger action against the multibillion-dollar cocaine and marijuana trade, was kidnapped by drug traffickers in January. A week later, police acting on a tip raided a farmhouse where he was held and rescued him unharmed. One group, the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION>, is said to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with being one of its leaders.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> observer said Monday he will defy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to shut the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they would not try to close it immediately. <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities would have to `` put me behind steel bars'' if they wanted to close the mission, which is in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> townhouse. `` We have the right to stay here and we will stay where we are,'' he told a news conference, and added that if the mission is closed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should exclude <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from debates on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Last Friday, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he would have to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer mission as required by a new anti-terrorist law. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday another session of the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> was possible this week in an effort to retaliate or thwart <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission was established 13 years ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they would not physically close it by March 21, as stipulated in the law, but would let legal proceedings run their course. The legal situation was confused. <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> said he opposes <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> action in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts because the dispute is between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unless I am dragged, I see no reason why I should appear in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> added, however, that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen might sue in an American court to keep the mission open and protect constitutional rights of free speech and association. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the sole legitimate representative of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people and it has non-voting observer status. Its representatives have the right to address every <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> debate on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization. If the mission is forced to close and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> message can not be heard, <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> should decide `` in a sense of fairness and justice'' to exclude <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> debates. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have said the decision to close the mission violates the international <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> allows <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> missions to operate. At a three-day emergency session Feb. 29-March 2, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> condemned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to close the mission, asked the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule on arbitration and urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to abide by the Headquarters Treaty. It passed the resolution of condemnation overwhelmingly, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not participating, and decided to reconvene before March 21 to decide what to do if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> decided to press ahead with closing the mission. General Assembly resolutions carry moral weight as expressions of world opinion but are not binding, as are those of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

 Many roads in mountainous western <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> remained impassable because of snow or avalanches Monday, leaving thousands of tourists trapped at ski resorts. In <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> province, 10 people died under avalanches last weekend. Forestry experts and mountain rescue officials predicted new slides of wet snow this week. Traffic chaos in the area eased a bit. Parts of westernmost <LOCATION> Vorarlberg </LOCATION> province remained isolated, however, and tourists were stranded at the resorts of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>, Zuers and Stuben and in the <LOCATION> Kleine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walsertal </LOCATION> valley along the border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Among those isolated by the masses of snow were former Queen <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, who are staying in a hotel at <ORGANIZATION> Lech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arlberg </ORGANIZATION>. The royal guests had planned to leave last Saturday. A helicopter flight out of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> also had to be canceled because of bad weather. Snowfalls resumed at noon in western <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and supply flights to isolated towns and villages were impossible. Local officials said there was no lack of food because emergency supplies had been stored. Snow removal and cleanup operations continued at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION>, the tourist resort in western <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION> hit by avalanche disasters. Five Swedish vacationers and two local women were killed by two huge avalanches early Sunday. Damage was estimated in the millions of dollars. Experts said wet snow does not settle down unless the ground is frozen. They said recent mild weather, coupled with rising temperatures predicted for Tuesday and Wednesday, is bound to increase avalanche danger. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anton </LOCATION>, at least 14 houses, including hotels and guesthouses, were wholly or partially destroyed by avalanches. Work teams cleared snow from the approaches of the <LOCATION> Arlberg </LOCATION> tunnel, allowing trains to travel to <LOCATION> Vorarlberg </LOCATION> province. In <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> province, the main westward rail line was closed for most of Monday because of acute avalanche danger. Long-distance trains were diverted through <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> shot missiles at each other's most heavily populated cities and pounded border towns with renewed intensity Monday after a weekend truce. Scores of civilians were killed and wounded. In a resumption of the `` war of the cities,'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported it fired eight surface-to-surface missiles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the last one at 11:27 p.m., and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> said its forces shot two missiles at <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. The Iraqis, declaring an all-out offensive on Iranian cities, also launched air raids on `` military and economic targets'' in Dezful, <LOCATION> Kermanshah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shushtar </PERSON> and three other border towns, scoring what it said were `` destructive hits.'' Iraqi communiques said the air raids were carried out in a 40-minute period, with all planes returning safely. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also claimed its helicopter gunships downed an Iranian helicopter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, meanwhile, claimed its Revolutionary Guards and Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas have killed or wounded 1,900 Iraqis during ground assaults that began Sunday in the mountains of northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> reported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> fired nine surface-to-surface missiles into Umm Qasr, an industrial town near <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s southern border with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and said anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi fighter-bomber in the northeastern battles. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said the Iraqis fired eight long-range <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Monday. It said the barrage was a reprisal for the shelling of Iraqi border towns Sunday night in which at least 21 civilians were killed and 80 wounded. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> resumed firing on Sunday when it shot a lone `` warning'' missile into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, also in retaliation for the shelling of civilian areas. The exchanges shattered the uneasy two-day truce in the war against cities that began Friday, bringing a brief respite after a 12-day exchange of missiles, artillery fire and air raids by both sides. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, reported that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s missiles on Monday exploded in residential sections of the Iranian capital, a city of 6 million, killing at least 26 civilians and wounding 50. The news agency, quoting military communiques, said the Iranians retaliated by lobbing two missiles at `` military and economic centers'' in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqis reported that only one missile crashed into a residential area, killing an undisclosed number of civilians. The missile exploded as oil and energy chiefs from 20 Arab countries gathered in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for a conference on resources. Officials in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ministers had canceled plans to attend the session, apparently because of the flare-up in the war. Both sides in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war vowed to keep pounding each other cities until the other quits `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not rest until the blood of our martyrs of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missile and air attacks has been avenged,'' said <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and head of the War Information headquarters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified military spokesman in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as saying that `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has decided to resume its missile attacks and air raids on all Iranian cities, not just <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> ... because of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new crimes.'' The Iraqi agency said that heavy Iranian shellfire of the border cities that began Sunday was continuing Monday, with a `` large number'' of civilians killed or wounded. It said the northern towns of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> were badly hit. Iraqi communiques said the southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, heavily bombarded by the Iranians in the last 18 months, was hammered by artillery and short-range missiles, with casualties reported to be heavy. The nearby refinery town of <LOCATION> Zubair </LOCATION> and other southern towns also were being shelled, the communiques reported. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it fired 71 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> and the central city of <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, capital of ancient <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION>, between Feb. 29 and March 11. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it shot 27 missiles into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and two into the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Mosul </LOCATION> in that period.

 The judge in the case of seven revolutionaries accused of plotting the overthrow of the government refused a defense request Monday to let the three women defendants be tried separately from their husbands. Ruling on pretrial motions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> also rejected the defendants' request to dismiss the case because of what they claimed was the vagueness of the sedition statute under which they were charged. However, the judge gave the defense a victory when he indicated that witnesses who had been hypnotized to help them recall events related to the case might not be allowed to testify. Jury selection was slated to begin Tuesday. The trial is expected to last up to a year. The so-called <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> 7 face one count each of seditious conspiracy, racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $ 20,000 in fines.

Two others, <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, allegedly joined them on later crimes. The wives of three defendants _ <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> _ are accused of harboring their husbands as fugitives, using false identification and taking part in some bombings. Ms. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, argued Monday that prosecutors were trying to `` bury the women'' by tying them to the crimes allegedly committed by their husbands. Prosecutors, however, accused the women of taking an equal part in planning the violent crimes, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> denied the women's request for a separate trial Young denied without comment the defendents' motion to dismiss the case because of what they claimed was the vagueness of the sedition statute, enacted during the Civil War to punish Confederate rebels. He also denied a motion by the government to add to the indictment some of the defendants' convictions on bombing, robbery and other charges. Prosecutors had asked that the convictions be included to help prove a conspiracy. The judge agreed Monday with the defense team's objection to government witnesses who were hypnotized to help them recall events. `` Before that witness takes the stand, before you even call that witness, you must file a motion detailing explicitly that witness's pre-hypnotic testimony,'' the judge told prosecutors `` I am not disposed to let any of these witnesses testify to anything.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said after the hearing that two or three witnesses had been hypnotized. He would n't comment on who they were or their potential importance to the prosecution.

<HEAD>NOAA Issues $100,000 In Fines For Illegal Fishing In Bering Sea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has levied fines totaling $ 100,000 against three Japanese firms whose ships were videotaped apparently fishing illegally in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in early January. The civil fines of $ 25,000 per vessel involved are the maximum allowed under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. `` This underscores how seriously we viewed the violations,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a deputy general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. He said the Japanese companies can seek an administrative hearing on the fines if they decide to appeal. Northwest congressmen, who had criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of the fishing situation, were pleased with the fines. `` This action should send a powerful message to any fisherman who is thinking about fishing illegally in our waters,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash. Added Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash.: `` If these fines make it dangerous to fish illegally in our waters and if these fines make it expensive for outlaw fishing vessels if they get caught, then I am all for them The fines were based on a review of the videotapes and depositions taken from commercial fishermen who chartered a plane and photographed the vessels with their nets down allegedly 38 miles inside the American fishing zone, said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. The investigation was conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> lawyer in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and the fines issued late last week. Two of the vessels videotaped are owned and operated by <ORGANIZATION> Hamaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which was fined a total of $ 50,000, said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. The other two vessels are owned and operated by <ORGANIZATION> Senkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gyogyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Taisei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gyogyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, Those companies each were fined $ 25,000. In addition, the owners and operators of two unidentified fishing vessels that were also videotaped were fined a total of $ 100,000. The identification numbers on the vessels were covered at the time they were photographed. Those fines were for illegal fishing and for having their identifying marks obscured. `` We expect we will get the cooperation of the Japanese government in tracking those vessels,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> was considering denying applications for permits from the three companies to fish in American waters until 1992. Foreign vessels are not currently allowed to fish in the 200-mile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zone off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but they are allowed to participate in joint ventures with American firms. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the denial of permits would bar the three Japanese firms from participating in joint ventures. American fishermen and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> have suspected for more than a year that foreign trawlers were slipping into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zone under cover of darkness or in stormy weather to fish illegally. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said Monday he was not aware of the <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> fines and declined comment.

 A jury Monday found <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> disciple and would-be presidential assassin <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> `` Squeaky'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> guilty of escaping from a federal prison after she told the panel: `` You do n't have any choice.'' `` I'm guilty as charged, legally, and without remorse morally, so that's that,'' <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, acting as her own lawyer, said in closing arguments. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>, 39, a disciple of mass murderer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, is serving a life sentence for a 1975 assassination attempt against President Ford. She escaped Dec. 23 from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Alderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and was captured about two miles away on Christmas after a manhunt <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> called only herself as a witness and carefully followed <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON>'s instructions that her testimony had to be in the form of questions and answers, questioning herself on the pronunciation of her name and cautioning: `` Miss Fromme, you talk too much,'' and `` Wait a minute, you're getting ahead of yourself.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury returned its verdict after less than 10 minutes of deliberation. Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON> set an April 28 sentencing date. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> faces an additional sentence of up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> has been described as the main member of the `` family'' that congregated around <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, who is serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the 1969 murders of actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> and eight others. She told the jury Monday that she attempted to escape because `` I got word that -LRB- <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> -RRB- had cancer. `` He needs a relative, somebody to check on him,'' she said of <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, whom she described as `` my husband, my brother, my father, my son, the man who's been my friend.'' She said she decided to escape because `` my access to him is so limited, I've been feeling helpless for years. If love means anything at all it means stop feeling helpless ... -LRB- and -RRB- take action if necessary.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandfass </PERSON> called four prison employees to testify about <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>'s disappearance and her capture. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> cross-examined each government witness on the population of the prison, and each of them indicated the institution _ which has an official capacity of 670 prisoners _ now holds about 1,000, In her testimony she told the jury that the overcrowding was one of the reasons she tried to escape. `` The prison has become more and more crowded, and the institution staff has become more and more tense,'' she said The judge had twice denied <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON>'s request for a no-contest plea and entered an innocent plea on her behalf. <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Hallanan </PERSON> the case `` does n't warrant a jury trial'' and said she was `` willing to accept whatever sentence you hand down to me.'' But <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> failed on Monday to ask for `` bench trial,'' which would have left the decision in the judge's hands without calling a jury. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was unharmed when a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent grabbed a semiautomatic .45 - caliber pistol aimed at him by <PERSON> Fromme </PERSON> on Sept. 5, In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 17 days later, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> escaped injury when <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 45, fired a revolver at him. She eventually pleaded guilty and received a life sentence. In 1979, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also escaped from the <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> prison but was recaptured hours later about 25 miles away.

 Activists protesting the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in a paper mill succeeded in depositing a dead fish in a safety deposit box despite pleas from bank officials The protesters appeared outside the bank building at noon in opposition to what they said are toxic hazards at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> mill in <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Mill workers on strike since last June have been replaced and in recent weeks, there have beeen three incidents of gas leaks. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> and a group from <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, placed dead fish in safety deposit boxes in several <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> branches last week to symbolize what they said are the fish killed in the <LOCATION> Androscoggin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because of International Paper's alleged toxic dumping. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> controls 189,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> and a bank board member, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, is on the board of International Paper. On Monday, three activists entered the bank as some people outside chanted `` <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, they wo n't tell, holy mackerel, what's that smell?'' As <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, representing the protesters, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> worker, and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> resident, walked to the vault, a coterie of bank security guards scurried after them, banishing press photographers from the premises. One bank official, who declined to give his name, first tried to dissuade the protesters from placing two fish inside the deposit box. `` I'm just another schlep here,'' he told them. `` I do n't know why you want to do this, but I do n't think it's a good idea.'' Another official, who would only identify himself as `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>,'' informed <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> that he would be allowed to place the two dead fish in his box, but that the bank planned to terminate his contract immediately thereafter. `` We're asking you to surrender the box,'' said the official. `` We do n't want you as a customer any more.'' <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> then desposited the fish and was ushered out of the building. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, said the protesters' tactics were hypocritical and caused a health issue. `` They're jeopardizing the safety and health of bank employees and customers,'' he said, arguing that the dead fish could attract cockroaches. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the bank has been, and will remain, neutral in the controversy surrounding the paper mill and the strike. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paperworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firemen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oilers </ORGANIZATION> walked out June 16 in a contract dispute. International Paper wanted to eliminate 170 jobs and cut premium pay on Sundays. Eight workers were sent to the hospital after being exposed to hydrogen sulfide on Jan. 28, and a 112,000-gallon chlorine dioxide leak on Feb. 5 forced nearly 4,000 residents out of their homes and schools for several hours. A leak on Feb. 14 chlorine gas leak injured seven people. Following protests from residents, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> agreed on a full-scale inspection of the plant, at the company's expense, by an outside consultant selected by the state. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greener </PERSON>, spokesman for International Paper in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> last week announced they had found no reason to close down the mill. <PERSON> Greener </PERSON> said the three chemical leaks were `` something to be avoided'' and said the company is cooperating with efforts to make the mill as safe as possible. He denied the protesters' claim that the company engages in toxic dumping.

 A theological conservative was elected president Monday of divided <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> and said he will hire as faculty members only those who accept the Bible as the literal truth. A moderate on the seminary's board of trustees warned `` there will be no peace'' at the 1,009-student school if <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> makes good on his commitment to carry out the agenda of the board's conservative majority <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>, 61, a professor of evangelism at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, takes office April 1 at Southeastern, the fourth-largest of six <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> seminaries. It was founded in 1950. <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>, an associate of evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, pledged to seek peace among the school's factions and said he he would preserve academic quality and freedom of inquiry at the seminary. However, he also said he will implement the agenda of the conservatives, including hiring as faculty members only those scholars who hold the `` inerrancy'' view that the Bible is literally true, even in matters of science and history. Theological moderates believe the Scriptures were divinely inspired but may contain errors by their human authors. The issue is at the heart of a clash that has divided the nation's biggest Protestant denomination for several years. There are 14.6 million Southern Baptists. <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON>, a moderate who announced his resignation in the fall after 14 years. <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON> said he could not carry out what he called the conservatives' plan to `` create a fundamentalist seminary.'' Four administrators also resigned. `` It will be my prayer ... that a fresh wind of spiritual renewal could sweep the campus, fostering a spirit of love, harmony and reconciliation and commitment to all that God would accomplish in and through the institution,'' <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> said. Despite his conservative orientation, <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> had been described as perhaps the only candidate acceptable to conservatives and moderates because of his academic credentials and what colleagues describe as a tolerant attitude and agreeable personality. The board's vote 21-6 with one abstention to hire <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> after nearly 90 minutes of debate. `` Dr. <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON>'s view of the Bible is one I can not accept,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a moderate trustee from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said in an interview. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> read a statement on behalf of other moderates that accused the conservatives of trying to `` shift radically the theological foundation of the school toward fundamentalism. ... We will not endorse such an erosion of the school's historic character.'' <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said a faculty panel that met with <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> a less than 50 percent confidence rating. The faculty raised concerns about his his understanding of the moderate-conservative rift, his appreciation of the `` broad Baptist constituency'' and his leadership skills, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, the conservative trustee chairman and a <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, minister, said <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> `` brings to this new job impeccable credentials, an enviable track record and every qualification we could have wanted for a new president.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON>, president of the seminary chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought the conservatives, said the faculty would give <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> a chance to demonstrate his commitment to academic freedom and excellence. `` But we want to make fully clear that if his dream is the same dream as the trustee majority there will be no peace here,'' <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Drummond </PERSON> has been administrative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Billy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since 1981 and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> professor of evangelism at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> since 1973.

 Troops shut down one of the biggest produce markets in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Monday, turning away 70 trucks of food grown by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> farmers and tightening the economic noose on the occupied territories. Soldiers also shot and wounded at least 11 Arabs, and a 3-year-old girl was in serious condition after she was hit in the right eye by a rubber bullet, hospital officials said. The army imposed a nightly 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. curfew over the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for the first time since unrest began in the territories Dec. 8. A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the curfew will be in effect indefinitely. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the curfew was to prevent `` the entrance of violent instigators ... and of written instigation material'' to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> where about 600,000 Palestinians live. All residents will have to stay home while the army seals off entrances to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the radio said. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile reported that the Israeli army will spray rock-hurling protesters with paint from helicopters so they can be identified and arrested. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with what he said were new ideas for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. Also on Monday, another 150 Arab policemen in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> announced they would resign, joining 450 other officers in the occupied territories who quit earlier, according to an Arab reporter who watched many turn in their uniforms. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities acknowledged some police quit but gave no figures. About 850 Arab police worked in the occupied territories. The resignations were ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> two days after the slaying of a <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> policeman accused of collaborating with the Israelis. `` It is clear their resignations were not handed in freely but because they fear for their lives,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. In apparent response to the PLO-backed protests and unrest, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stepped up economic sanctions, including a ban on the shipment of gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakak </PERSON> of the Israeli-owned <ORGANIZATION> Padesco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies fuel to 50 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> gas stations, said drivers were afraid to make deliveries after two tank trucks were attack and burned. In <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, 22 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, soldiers closed the regional fruit and vegetable market, turning away 70 trucks carrying produce, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants said. `` We started to sell about 8 a.m. when the soldiers came and forced us to close,'' said one merchant who refused to give his name, saying he was being watched by a collaborator. He said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> farmers tried to open informal markets elsewhere, but soldiers chased them away. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaflets have ordered <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> shops to open only in the morning. But on Monday, merchants said troops told them they could operate only after noon. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor from An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who lives in <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities wanted to break the back of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> strike with economic pressure. `` The military government is trying to tell the people here who is boss. <PERSON> Jericho </PERSON> is an agricultural city. To order the market closed in the morning amounts to killing it economically,'' <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON> said. At least 91 Arabs have been killed during unrest in the occupied territories since rioting began, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> figures. In <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yamoun </LOCATION>, troops using live ammunition shot and wounded 11 Arabs.

 A baby born with most of his brain missing clung to life Monday at a hospital where doctors hoped to make the doomed infant's organs available for transplant, a hospital spokeswoman said. `` He shows progressive signs of brain stem deterioriation but has not yet met all the criteria for total brain death,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> hospital March 10 with a fatal birth defect known as anencephaly, in which much of the brain and skull are missing. The newborn's other vital organs are healthy, and his parents asked that their child be considered an organ donor. He was transferred to <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> has developed the nation's first medical guidelines for preserving anencephalics' heart and other vital organs for transplanting into critically ill infants. The baby is the fourth brain-absent newborn accepted at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> for possible use as an organ donor. Under criteria established by the hospital, <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION> was placed on life-support systems for a seven-day period, which ends Thursday night. If doctors determine that Baby D is brain-dead during that period, the hospital will serve notice that the organs are available for transplant. If the infant is not declared brain-dead within seven days, Baby D will be taken off the respirator and will be allowed to die naturally. The guidelines were developed to address ethical questions surrounding use of doomed anencephalics as organ donors. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> received nationwide attention and criticism in 1984 when Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> transplanted a baboon's heart into a girl known as Baby Fae.

 Police fired tear gas Monday at protesters who blocked traffic in the capital and cried, `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go!'' Work stoppages broke out as employees learned they would not be paid by a government that has run out of money. The government began selling sacks of food, called `` dignity bags,'' to unpaid workers. Some schoolteachers, telephone company and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> dock workers demanded cash and struck to reinforce their demand. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced it had sent 104 Marines and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> military police to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to reinforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security units. Violence was reported in the port city of Colon at the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> entrance of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Psichoyos </PERSON>, a manager of the Rey supermarket chain, said two company stores were attacked by gangs demanding free food for government employees. Five supermarket employees were injured in fights with the attackers, one of them seriously, <PERSON> Psichoyos </PERSON> said. He said the gangs were supporters of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's strongman. Protesters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> erected flaming street barricades of trash. Others yelled at security forces and were met by volleys of tear gas. For the first time, the disturbances reached into the heart of the capital's business district. Riot police used tear gas to disperse about 600 primary and secondary school teachers blocking traffic in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want our pay!'' shouted the teachers. `` Books yes, arms no!'' As the police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas grenades, forcibly removed them, the teachers cried: `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go!'' No arrests were reported. Primary and secondary schools were to have reopened Monday following a three-month vacation, but they stayed closed. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said about 700 employees walked off their jobs at 9 a.m. at the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> entrance to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, after being told they would not be paid their semi-monthly salaries. `` This strike is not a political movement,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a forklift operator who makes $ 5.85 an hour. `` All we want is that the workers get their money.'' <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, the port administrator, said the strike would have `` absolutely nothing'' to do with traffic through the 50-mile waterway linking the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oceans </LOCATION>. Dock workers also struck at Colon 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Colon residents told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that in another protest, teachers temporarily blocked the highway that runs parallel to the canal. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that 60 Marines and a 44-man <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> police unit were flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Monday. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prucha </PERSON>, said, `` This is simply a prudent measure to augment the security personnel who are already in place.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to withhold a $ 6.5 million payment due <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday was aimed at impairing the Panamanian government's ability to pay <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 130,000 public workers this week Withholding the payment was one of a number of economic sanctions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly one in every five working Panamanians is employed by the government. Until now, they have supported <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, at least outwardly. According to Panamanian figures, their payroll comes to about $ 33 million every two weeks. Diplomatic sources and private economists, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the nation's treasury is empty The `` dignity bags'' contained such staples of the Panamanian diet as rice, beans, flour, onions, cheese and lard. They were being sold for between $ 15 and $ 16 but the government apparently was not demanding immediate payment. <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency prepared 12,000 of the bags. The nation's new civilian chief executive, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other top officials resumed an emergency economic conference Monday morning after recessing an earlier session at 2 a.m. without comment. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, installed by the military last month, has been meeting frequently with his chief advisers but Sunday's meeting was the first time that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been known to join them. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the power behind the government since 1983, was indicted by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand juries last month on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. About 40 employees outside the state-run telephone company's main office told reporters they were striking because they had not been paid `` Nobody has told us anything,'' said one worker, who refused to identify himself. The 118 local and foreign banks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> remained closed by government order for the 10th straight day. Most had closed their doors earlier because the government was unable to provide them with the cash to cover a run on deposits. The bank run began Feb. 26, the day <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the dismissal of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president. The day before, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The deposed president has been in hiding for more than two weeks, but is still recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate chief executive.

 A former official in Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s administration, testifying Monday at the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial, accused a key prosecution witness of lying about an alleged death threat <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said the witness, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, `` really had it in for <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>,'' the man <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> accused of making the threat. In a heated round of questioning, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> insisted repeatedly he did not believe a death threat had been made. `` I thought <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> really detested <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> whether he was accusing <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> of lying, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said: `` I testified I think she did lie on that.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, former state prison construction chief, has been accused of threatening <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide who was testifying at the time before a grand jury investigating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s finances <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades, is charged with obstructing an attorney general's investigation of the alleged threat Other impeachment charges against the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> allege he concealed a $ 350,000 campaign fund and misused $ 80,000 in a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has not attended the trial since it began Feb. 29. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, accused the state police of intimidating defense witnesses as he moved for a mistrial or dismissal of charges against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sent a letter to acting Gov. Rose Mofford asking that three top state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> officials be placed on leave. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sugested that federal authorities be called in to investigate the intimidation claims. `` A political trial that is difficult at best is made even more difficult when witnesses are subject to these kinds of intimidation and harassment,'' the letter said. There was no immediate response from Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s office to the letter requesting that she place <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON> and two other officials on leave. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who is presiding over the impeachment trial, said he would not rule on Craft's motion until Tuesday <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> also spent an hour in chambers with attorneys. Prosecutors asked for sanctions against Craft for trying the case in the news media with a weekend news conference, according to Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Democrat who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> prosecution team. Craft held the news conference to protest the arrest Friday of defense witness <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> on an outstanding warrant. She had testified the day before. DPS arrested Ms. Fields on a January warrant charging that she failed to attend court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous meetings following a driving-while-intoxicated conviction. She was released on $ 1,000 bond. Ms. Fields testified that a state official who had testified about the alleged threat tended to exaggerate. Ms. Fields also said she thought there had been no death threat. DPS spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> has denied that Ms. Fields' arrest was an attempt to intimidate impeachment trial witnesses Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> testified Monday that he considered the alleged death threat `` a culmination of comical errors.'' `` I saw no crime,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> testified. He denied any attempt to shield <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. House prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, confronting <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> with his own words in a news release, a newspaper interview and a tape recording of a phone call, suggested <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> tried to shief <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and help him pass a lie detector test. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said he was misquoted in the newspaper article and was n't sure his phone conversation with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' attorney was transcribed accurately. He complained bitterly that the conversation with attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was illegal because it was recorded without his knowledge. On the tape, he was quoted as saying: `` I love <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and I want to save his ass. I believe he's being railroaded.'' A transcript also shows <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> discussing questions that could help <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> pass the polygraph test. Outside, some 200 pro-Mecham demonstrators protested Ms. Fields' arrest They carried placards denouncing the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> and the news media and calling for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s reinstatement as governor. A two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and remove him from office. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> contends he has broken no law and is the victim of a political conspiracy. He also faces an April 21 criminal trial on felony counts alleging he concealed the $ 350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.

<HEAD>Independent Producers Seek Exemptions From Striking Scriptwriters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 50 independent TV production companies, including <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s `` Tonight Show,'' appealed to striking scriptwriters for an exemption from the walkout, a union official said Monday. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> executive director of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the union board would consider the special requests to allow scriptwriters to return to work at some companies during the strike. The strike by 9,000 Guild members against the 200-member <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> began March 7. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> declined to identify the productions companies seeking special, interim agreements, but `` The Tonight Show,'' announced it was among them. About 40 percent of the companies that make shows for television are wholly independent. Of the rest, about half are considered independent but are affiliated with a major studio. Among shows already rejected for an exemption was the Academy Awards ceremony, which is scheduled for worldwide broadcast April 11. <ORGANIZATION> Lobell-Bergman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the strike has affected development of five of eight movies on its slate and stopped work on a network comedy series. Previously postponed was a revival of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> Comedy Hour'' and a new series, `` The Dictator,'' starring <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. A spokesman for the producers belittled the union's assertion about the number of independents seeking waivers. `` With the exception of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, I do n't know of any other independent producer looking to make a deal who is also member of the alliance,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. No new talks were scheduled in strike. The guild is seeking greater creative control, higher residuals from foreign market distribution, and no adjustment by producers of residuals for hour-long syndicated TV shows.

 A former gang member testified Monday that he agreed to the assassination of Chinese-American journalist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> because he believed it was a patriotic act requested directly by the Taiwanese government. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuei-sen </PERSON>, the former member of a Taiwanese criminal `` Bamboo Gang,'' has pleaded innocent to the 1984 shooting death of journalist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>. He faces a sentence of 27 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder with the use of a handgun. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, 52, was killed in the garage of his <LOCATION> Daly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> home just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Oct. 15, 1984. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, a columnist for Chinese-language newspapers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had just finished a biography critical of <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s president from 1978 until his death of a heart attack in January. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>, 35, has admitted the killing but went to trial because the prosecution has not offered a plea bargain and because <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> want to tell his story, said defense attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> testified in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that he had never heard of <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> or his writings until he was driven to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> the day before the killing. Speaking through an intepreter, he said he agreed to act as a gunman at the request of <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi-li </PERSON>, a reputed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> gang leader who told him he received his orders from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s then chief of military intelligence, Vice Adm. <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> Hsi-ling. `` He asked first of all, ` Am I willing to help my country?''' said <PERSON> Tung </PERSON>. `` I said, ` Yes, of course, because this is everyone's obligation. And then he showed me he was a member of the intelligence bureau with the ID card of the intelligence bureau of the Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> was a traitor who had become a double agent for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> said he was recruited by <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> because they both been <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> members before <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to set up an import-export business in August, 1984. Two years ago, <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> testified about his role in the Liu killing while on trial on heroin smuggling charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He has said that he wanted to testify in order to apologize and possibly lessen his sentence. He received 20 years in prison for conspiracy to smuggle 600 pounds of heroin into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> described the shooting scene Monday. He said he and <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> rode up to <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s home on bicycles, hiding in the garage until <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> came in. He said <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> shot first. `` I heard a shot and I went forward and I saw this man fall down. At that time, I believed that should be the man I should assassinate. I aimed at his tummy and shot him twice,'' <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tung </PERSON> fled the country and was apprehended in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> after stops in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi-Li </PERSON>, reputed head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bamboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> were convicted in a <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> court and are serving life terms in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The Taiwanese government has refused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to have them extradited for trial here. <PERSON> Weng </PERSON> and two of his aides were convicted and given life sentences in the case. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> testified that the admiral and other high-ranking military officers recruited him to kill <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador personally notified President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> about the indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> of Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on narcotics trafficking charges, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> said Monday. `` We have formally notified them, but have not yet revealed the details of the case,'' <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> said. `` They will be passed along when they're made available.'' He said Ambassador <PERSON> Brunson </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> Thursday, the same day the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment was unsealed. <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> would not say if <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> discussed the possible extradition of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> or recommended any course of action. The indictment accuses <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, along with his brother and ex-wife, of using a private airstrip to fly a 220-pound cocaine shipment to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> for delivery to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> commands the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> that backs up police in this capital city with a population of 1 million. The indictment puts <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a precarious situation. The 57-year-old political science professor came to power in a Jan. 17 election that many Haitians boycotted, foreign observers criticized and rival candidates said was rigged by the army. A decision to act against <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> could provoke a coup, and if <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> ignores the indictment it could affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid vital to this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation and its 6 million people. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> issued a statement last week through a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firm calling the incident `` a matter of concern'' that will be handled in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> by military courts. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> is in a `` horrible situation,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke with the condition he not be identified. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> knows that if he goes -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- he will land in jail.

 Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> brought his tough trade talk to a bastion of organized labor Monday night, telling Democrats here that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies must be prepared to accept U.S.-made products For <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, whose campaign stumbled badly on Super Tuesday, the March 26 Democratic caucuses here are a crucial test. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman passed up campaigning in Tuesday's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> told about 300 supporters that in the past, the threat of tariffs has helped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> persuade <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to stop dumping wood products and the Japanese in dumping microchips on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. `` When we finally lose the timidity and stand up for basic fairness, other countries open up,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has made trade issues a campaign centerpiece. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> drew scattered groans and catcalls from the audience when he quoted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying the trade deficit was a sign of strength. `` I thought maybe he got his cuecards messed up,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. Even as <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> talked up his stance on trade, lawmakers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> moved toward to discard the trade amendment the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman authored. Senators are starting to push their House counterparts in earnest to abandon the provision as conferees from the two houses try to hammer out a final version of sweeping trade legislation. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action represented `` nothing new'' in the trade debate. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> planned to remain in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> through Wednesday, then return Friday to continue campaigning in advance of the caucuses. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s state chairman, said the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman had between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 available for a television advertising blitz over the next 11 days. `` It's very important that I win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and we're going to win in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said after the speech. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> likened <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign to that of 1948, when another Missourian, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, won an upset victory for the White House. `` I predict he's going to surprise a lot of people,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> talked to more than 300 members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 569 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, where he repeated his call to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s declining industrial base.

<TEXT>
 In 1948, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> left his native <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> neighborhood in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, an eager 38-year-old lawyer ready to represent the bustling city in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> became an institution in the intervening 40 years: fighting for liberal legislation, controlling one of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' most powerful committees and helping write into history the downfall of a president. On Monday, the 78-year-old congressman announced his plans to retire after 20 terms. In those years, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> decayed from the heart of the Garden State into the brunt of jokes. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s political base eroded, too. His decision not to seek re-election came in the face of mounting pressure from black political leaders, who claim it's now their time to represent the vastly changed area. Born in 1909, the son of an Italian immigrant toolmaker, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> seemed awed by responsibility when he was placed in charge of the President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s impeachment proceedings in 1974. `` If fate had been looking for one of the powerhouses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it would n't have picked me,'' he told a reporter then. But <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s steady, judicious handling of the momentous hearings earned him widespread praise and helped produce an overwhelming bipartisan majority in favor of impeachment. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> said last year he retired to a private office and cried after his committee approved three articles of impeachment, forcing <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to resign two weeks later. More recently, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> was again in on the making of history, as a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee that investigated the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the funneling of profits to the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Contra rebels. He had harsh words for what he called the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's lack of concern for the Constitution. He has continually used the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to press for civil rights and what he calls `` the rule of law.'' Little in the early years of <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s career suggested he might climb to the center stage of national political life. A child of the Depression, he completed law school in 1937, after 10 years of night classes. He was later decorated for World War II Army service in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Like many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> relied upon service to his constituents for his electoral success. But he was a strong civil rights advocate, and that served him well as his once-prosperous city became predominantly black by the 1970s. He spoke proudly of his Italian heritage, and sponsored legislation that made Columbus Day part of a three-day annual holiday. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> was an unknown quantity,'' former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, D-Mass., once recalled `` He was a flame under a bushel basket.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s political demise raised <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s stock considerably. He made the cover of national news magazines, starred on the dinner circuit, and was even interviewed to be <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s running mate in 1976. In December 1980, his wife and high-school sweetheart, <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Stango </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>, died after suffering for two years from a brain tumor. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> had missed many a House session caring for her. He received further blows in 1982 and 1983 when he lost his brother, sister and mother-in-law. <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> focused himself on his work, running for his seat and winning, despite ever-mounting challenges. Two years ago, he hinted he would step down as soon as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office. He said then he would concentrate on writing his memoirs.

<TEXT>
 At least 10,000 people marched through La Paz Monday in a funeral procession for a student who died from a bullet wound he received during a violent protest. Later Monday, about 5,000 workers demonstrated in the capital against the government's economic policies. At one point, police threw tear gas canisters to disperse protesters about to throw rocks at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. The students and faculty were protesting the death of <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Uria </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> who died Saturday morning after being hit by a bullet during a confrontation between students and police. The march was peaceful and no arrests were reported. Students said police were responsible for <PERSON> Uria </PERSON>'s death, but the Ministry of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> said the bullet was fired by students. Friday's protest was organized to demand an increase in the federal budget for universities. Students threw rocks at police, overturned vehicles and threw up roadblocks. Police pursued fleeing students onto the campus. A group of students returning from the funeral Monday afternoon destroyed a booth in downtown La Paz that was selling souvenirs of the pope's visit to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in May, witnesses said. Later in the afternoon, at least 5,000 workers marched through <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> to protest the economic policies of the administration of President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>. The march, organized by the Bolivian Workers Central, was called to pressure the government to increase wages, protect the government social security system and strengthen the public school system. `` The government is obeying the mandates of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and as a result workers are suffering the consequences with starvation wages,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, executive of the Workers Central, during a rally that preceded the march.

<HEAD>Spain's Shackling Justified, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The shackling of former <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Panther </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spain </PERSON> at his murder trial stemming from a 1971 prison breakout attempt was justified by the threat of violence, a prosecutor told an appeals court Monday. As the 38-year-old <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, newly released from prison after 21 years, looked on, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Niver </PERSON> argued that the judge who presided at the trial `` was confronted with six violent men'' charged with murder. `` It was reasonable for -LRB- the judge -RRB- to fear for the safety of those in the courtroom,'' <PERSON> Niver </PERSON> told the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` He tried the best way he knew how to protect the safety of the spectators.'' But <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, urged the panel to uphold a lower-court order granting <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> a new trial on the grounds that the heavy and painful shackles influenced the jury and deterred <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> from testifying. `` We know that this jury only heard one half the story,'' <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said. In five years of court proceedings and a 17-month trial, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> wore 25 pounds of chains around his body, arms and legs. The three-judge appeals panel heard more than 90 minutes of arguments and will rule on whether to reinstate <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s two murder convictions. One option raised during the hearing was to return the case to a lower court to find out what <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> would say if he had testified and whether it could have affected the verdict. <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> opposed the suggestion. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, released on $ 350,000 bail last week, told reporters after the hearing that being free was `` an incredible feeling'' and he was n't worried about the court sending him back to prison. `` I probably wo n't put a down payment on a home, but I ca n't stop living because of that possibility,'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> faces a more immediate threat to his freedom: a vote next week by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terms </ORGANIZATION> reconsidering a panel's decision to parole him from a life term for a 1966 murder-robbery committed when he was 17 In the unrelated trial known as the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> Six case, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was the only prisoner convicted of murder in a 1971 bloodbath that took the lives of militant leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, two other inmates and three guards. Authorities said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, who was seen running out of a maximum-security unit with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, conspired with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the escape attempt. Three other prisoners were acquitted, and two were convicted of assault. In his 1986 ruling granting <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> a new trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> had failed to consider alternatives to the shackling, such as the warnings used for another of the six defendants. But <PERSON> Niver </PERSON> said the appeals court, reviewing the trial years later, should defer to <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>'s evident conclusion that he had no safe alternative. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Niver </PERSON> on whether safety could have been maintained with less severe measures _ for example, leaving an arm unchained so <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> could write a note to his lawyer without pain. `` We would n't do that to an animal, right?'' <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Niver </PERSON> replied that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, even while fully manacled, threw a file folder at the jury and caused other courtroom disruptions. But <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said the disruptions were caused by the pain of the shackles.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Primary school teachers across <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> went on strike Monday demanding higher wages and forcing cancellation of most classes on the first day of the public school year. Officials said only in northeastern <LOCATION> Corrientes </LOCATION> province, where a salary agreement was reached earlier this month, did teachers begin regular classes for pre-schoolers and youngsters in grades one through seven. More than 450,000 members of the CTERA teachers' union are demanding a minimum salary of 770 australs a month _ the equivalent of $ 126. CTERA has said grade school teachers in some poorer provinces of this nation of 31 million people receive about 350 australs -LRB- $ 57 -RRB- a month, requiring many to seek second jobs. It issued a statement saying that except in <LOCATION> Corrientes </LOCATION>, at least 90 percent of the primary school teachers joined Monday's walkout. Their strike could extend to high school teachers if no agreement is reached by next Monday, the opening day of high school classes. University teachers have threatened to boycott classes because of wage conflicts. The government has acknowledged that teachers' salaries are low, but said the wage demands can not be met because of the country's severe economic problems Education and Justice Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> described the union decision to disrupt the opening of the school year as abrupt and lamentable. Most private schools, many of which are operated by churches, opened as scheduled but a few reported walkouts by teachers sympathetic with their public school collegues. CTERA is demanding a uniform minimum salary for teachers in all of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, noting differences between wages in districts in and around <LOCATION> Beunos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and those in lesser developed regions. The government and provinces have offered to gradually increase salaries by an unspecified amount over several months. That was rejected by CTERA, saying the offer was inadequate considering <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s rampant inflation. Inflation registered 189 percent over the past 12 months.

 Dissident <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said police detained him for two hours Monday and raided the house of another activist on the eve of an official ceremony marking an unsuccessful revolt against <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in 1848. Dissidents were planning their own demonstration following the official event scheduled for Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>, a writer, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> police picked him up at his house and handcuffed and beat him before taking him to a police station in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s 5th district where he was released after being held for two hours. He said he was warned that he and a colleague, <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON>, would be held responsible for any `` anti-system moves'' or disturbances if the dissidents hold a demonstration. Police also searched the home of <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON>, who is associated with the underground Inconnu cultural group, according to <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON>. Over the past two weeks, police raided the homes of at least seven dissidents including sociologist <PERSON> Ottilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Solt </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Gyoergy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gado </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demzsky </PERSON>, who runs the largest underground publishing operation in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, according to dissident sources. They said police seized hundreds of journals and documents. <PERSON> Haraszti </PERSON> said he also was criticized by the police for taking part in a recent two-day conference in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, organized by the West German Social Democrats to discuss detente, and for making a statement on Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the broadcast statement, he denied the official claim that police in the earlier house raids found leaflets opposing the consititution and legal order. He said only books and underground papers were confiscated. Last Friday, several official publications referred to the house searches and said proceedings were under way against six people, but they did not report the type of proceedings. Saturday's edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> said the police announcement of the raids showed that `` the organs responsible for public order had managed to stop irresponsible people from disturbing the March 15 holiday.'' It said that in addition to the official event, `` an opportunity has been offered for other types of commemorations if they are not of dubious intent and do not disturb the peace. `` It is impermissible that this celebration be used for adventurist goals.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> acknowledged Monday it has failed to win support for a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an end to the deadly missile duel against each other's cities by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> viewed the proposal as a maneuver to deflect attention from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> push for a worldwide arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for its refusal to honor the council's July 20 cease-fire resolution and peace plan. It is expected the council now will just issue a statement this week by the council president calling for an end to the missile attacks. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> acknowledged that the Soviet bid for a new resolution on the `` war of the cities'' had failed after the council met behind closed doors. `` Our personal preference would be a resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, but the important thing is `` not the form but the essence'' of the council's action. `` If the presidential statement has better chances than a resolution to be adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, we are all for it,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> urged the council to do its utmost to end the long-range duel, which he said was poisoning the `` political and psychological'' atomosphere for peace talks centering on the council's July resolution. A weekend truce in the war of the cities began collapsing Sunday. By Monday, both sides had unleashed missiles on each other's capitals. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are believed to be using Soviet-made Scud-B missiles in the duel that has killed scores of civilian since Feb. 29. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the council does not want to `` proliferate pieces of paper when we have a resolution that we are in the process of implementing.'' The superpowers have been at odds over the July 20 resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal to international boundaries as the first steps in a complex plan for negotiating an end to the 7 -LCB- - year-old war <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been trying to gain support since last fall for an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has refused to accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Judiciary Committee Can Receive Hastings

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Monday ordered grand jury material concerning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee considering his impeachment. In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had demonstrated a `` particularized need'' for the normally secret material. The grand jury had investigated whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> tipped off a politician about a <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretap the judge had authorized in 1985. No indictments resulted. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, 52, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, was acquitted in an unrelated case in 1983 of charges he conspired to solicit a $ 150,000 bribe. However, two fellow judges filed a complaint that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> lied in his defense and was guilty of judicial misconduct. A 27-judge Judicial Conference last year recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> consider <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' impeachment. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was appointed by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979, claims the impeachment proceedings are racially motivated.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> arrived here Monday with what he called new ideas for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks and said he would not give a yes-or-no reply to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blueprint for negotiations with the Arabs during his four-day stay. `` For us, these matters are questions of life and death, of our very existence,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Monday night in a speech to the United Jewish Appeal. While he promised to keep an open mind in the talks, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> took a hard line on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s retention of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, at least part of which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to surrender. `` I am astonished at some people's short memory,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` Did we have peace when we did not have these territories? Do n't they remember that the two most dangerous attempts to destroy us _ in 1948 and in 1967 _ were made when we did not control any of these territories Do they want us to go back to a situation which would inevitably invite another such attempt?'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s speech was well-received by an enthusiastic crowd of about 3,000 people, who gave him several standing ovations. Referring to the violence on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in which 91 Palestinians have perished, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said `` it is not a war for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in those areas. It is a war against Israelis, against the existence of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s reluctance to respond directly to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan did not seem to distress the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` We are not pressing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters at a White House briefing. But the official, who spoke under rules granting anonymity, said `` it is the situation in the area which is pressing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and all the other parties in the area.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not disclose the revisions he will propose to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who devised the plan and set this week as a deadline for a reply from the Israeli and Jordanian governments. The senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` we are not hung up'' on a specific date for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s response. But he said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> was not stable and `` we feel very strongly that everyone, Arabs and Israelis, must move forward.'' In an arrival statement, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the 1978 Camp David agreements, which called for a five-year trial period of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule, `` should serve as our guide.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also met Monday with three of the 30 senators who had sent him a letter urging him to give up some occupied territory in exchange for peace. The three Democrats _ Sens. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ again urged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> cede land for peace, but <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not soften his position. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not indicate whether <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would be willing to alter his formula for negotiations. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> simply called it `` a serious proposal'' that was under `` active consideration'' in Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> capitals. But the senior official said `` we wo n't let any aspect be eroded or compromised.'' He said the Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> framework was a `` work of ` genius,'' but was partly out of date, especially since <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians did not participate in negotiations that fell apart in 1981. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is pushing for a three-year interim arrangement on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, with negotiations for an overall settlement to open by December. He also is prodding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to cede territory in exchange for Arab recognition. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, stepping from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, said he was `` always open to new and constructive proposals'' to bring peace to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wished to live in peace with its neighbors, but that `` violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' to the region. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, cautioned that for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` to continue down the road developing now is a road to disaster <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that `` Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would be well-advised to listen to the viewpoints of the friends of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in this country,'' including <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the American Jewish community. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, after an overnight flight from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, met with about 30 Jewish leaders at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before continuing on to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, his spokesman, said, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told them, `` I have decided not to take any decision right now because people in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are divided.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the group, which including <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, that most people in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> want peace. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> added that the question was whether it was possible to make peace with the Arabs now and also maintain `` our normal lives and our security,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> escorted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to his hotel in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday morning and talked with him for a half-hour over coffee. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> reportedly underscored the importance of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit as well as the `` strong and unshakable'' ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In reply, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources said, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he had brought some `` new ideas'' that he would present to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in their talks over the next three days. In his arrival statement, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appealed for understanding. `` In our search for peace, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has always been helpful, open and indispensable,'' he said. He said `` violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the area `` is littered with broken agreements.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the Camp David agreement, which led to a peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979 but failed to resolve the Palestinian issue, `` should serve as our guide'' in the current search for a negotiating formula. He said if past accords were ignored `` future agreements will be meaningless.'' The Camp David agreement called for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> for five years. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians did not participate in the talks, which ended in failure in 1981. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has proposed a three-year interim arrangement, with talks on an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute to begin by December. On Sunday, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said `` after I come back with a summation of my talks with representatives of the American government, the cabinet will meet immediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject. Meanwhile Monday, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a Palestinian who met here with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in late January, urged the secretary to make room at the negotiating table for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, who is a newspaper editor in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said `` so far there has not been a credible effort to seek Palestinian representation.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan envisions a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians, who could participate only with the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have branded a terrorist group, would not take part directly. All the Arab governments have endorsed <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians.

 A wildfire that charred hundreds of square miles of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prairie, killing cattle and wildlife, was declared under control Monday, but surviving animals faced possible starvation without forage or feed. Federal and state officials were organizing a hay donation program for cattle roaming past burned fenceposts through the blackened terrain. Officials declared the five-county fire under control Monday about noon, said <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fly </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s head of operations for fire control. But the forecast called for continuing dry, windy weather. Damage was so widespread that crews were still trying to assess it five days after flames from burning trash went out of control near <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. Hundreds of firefighters, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> and state and federal workers contained the blaze after three days. The burned swath covered parts of an area 56 miles long and 24 miles wide. `` There's been a tremendous amount of forage lost right now,'' Fly said. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON> issued a disaster proclamation Monday, freeing up state money to help the area clean up and recover, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> of the governor's Emergency Management Division. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> was out of state. <PERSON> Bashur </PERSON> said representatives of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will instruct local officials Tuesday on how individuals can apply for relief grants from the federal government. In about 87,000 acres surveyed so far, more than 100 cattle were killed or had to be destroyed, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, agriculture extension agent in <LOCATION> Shackelford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the hardest-hit county with more than 250,000 acres burned. An additional 175 head were injured. Wildlife in the area also suffered, he said. A herd of about 20 antelope perished in the flames, according to ranchers who answered questions about damage as they put in requests for hay and feed to keep their livestock alive. There is a two-day supply of donated feed on hand, <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said. Ranchers without winter forage for their herds will have to sell their livestock, haul in hay or feed, or truck the cattle elsewhere, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> will make disaster aid available to reimburse firefighting costs in the five-county region, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director. If ranchers had to buy feed for all 15,000 cattle affected by the fire, it would require 175 tons a day, at a daily cost of $ 30,000, said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>. Over the weekend, ranchers from across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> began donating hay. By Sunday, tractor-trailers stacked with hay rolls were parked on the courthouse square in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. At least seven firefighters were treated for minor injuries, said Fly. The wildfire at one point threatened the towns of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>.

As testimony resumed for a third week with a former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration official undergoing intense cross-examination, defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> moved to interrupt the trial for a hearing on the intimidation claims. <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who is presiding over the impeachment trial, instead allowed testimony from former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> administration official <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> to continue.

 Critics of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 1890 constitution say it is anti-black and anti-business, but an unlikely coalition of blacks, business people and farmers may kill legislative efforts to rewrite the document. Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who took office in January, said rewriting the constitution `` would show that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is ready to take a step into the next century.'' `` My biggest argument is that the 1890 constitution is a document that's, in a lot of ways, gotten us into dead solid last place and that we really ca n't do any worse,'' said <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who incorporated the call for a new constitution into his successful campaign last year.

 All you have to say in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Lola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> the Great One, and everyone knows who you're talking about <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> is <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, the queen of ranchera music, whose rich, husky and wide-ranged voice can evoke the pain and happiness of love, tender feelings for the land or the gaiety of a Mexican fiesta. For 35 years, <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> has shared those sounds of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> throughout the world, often bringing tears to the eyes of homesick Mexicans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` My soul feels like crying. ... I need you so much and yet I swore I would never tell you this,'' she sang in one of her first concerts after she made a hit on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> XEW radio station. `` Three days without looking at you ... three days crying for you ... three days looking at the sunrise,'' she sang in another song, this one written by a friend _ composer <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, the sad-faced, tragic figure of modern Mexican music who died an early death and who became famous for songs about love, land, bars and drink. `` I will always remember <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said, recalling the times they performed together in Mexican films. `` Since he died, many beautiful things have disappeared. He was unique and extraordinary. Only those who go to heaven can have his kind of heart.'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> wrote the lyrics that broke down barriers and appealed to pure, raw, feelings. `` What can you know about life? When did you ever open with me the doors to <PERSON> Tenampa </PERSON>?'' which is a popular <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> mariachi bar. On March 12, <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> was honored in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION>. The honor came as the sounds of `` ranchera'' music gets new, widespread attention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from pop singer <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and her Spanish-language album `` Canciones de Mi Padre,'' or `` Songs of My Father.'' <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON>, who was recently in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> rehearsing for her current concert tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said she always has been an admirer of the regal <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>. `` When I was growing up, my father used to play the records of <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>, who has always been a great influence on my singing,'' <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> recalled. `` I love that young girl,'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said. `` Whenever I am in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she comes to see me and when she comes here, I am happy to receive her.'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> performed a duet last fall at the <ORGANIZATION> Acapulco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am very grateful to everyone,'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I have been lucky enough to sing for people like -LRB- Presidents -RRB- <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and -LRB- former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON>.'' Like most music of the people, `` ranchera'' music is similar to American country music, with a few Mexican variations. `` May the devil take you, you murderous bull,'' <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> curses in a soulful song that recounts the death of a young boy who sneaks into the corrals and is killed by the brave bulls under a moonlit night. Since <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>'s first three songs on XEW, she has maded more than 100 albums and acted in more than 50 movies. However, she is not as active as she used to be years ago when she would sing before a weekly TV audience or in between cockfights. But she does three benefits every year and has an invitation to sing at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> next May.

 The sprawling <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe garbage dump is being bulldozed and filled in to help rid <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of pollution, but for thousands of trash pickers it means the end of a way of life that began more than 40 years ago. A distinct class of the poor people _ 2,000 to 3,000 people _ had taken shape in and around the dump since it first opened in the 1940s and picking trash provided a livelihood for them. It grew into a tightly knit society regulated by a dump boss _ <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellez </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> being the most recent _ and outsiders were unwelcome. Now, the city government says, the trash pickers will be moved to homes with electricity and plumbing near a new but temporary dump, and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> will become a park. But the plan leaves trash pickers with mixed feelings and somewhat concerned about the future. The foul-smelling dump, spread over about 150 acres on the western edge of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was one of the largest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the last of the big open-air sites to be shut down by the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> government. `` This dump became an air pollution and public health problem,'' the city said in a news release announcing the project. Under an ambitious plan, the city began a year ago to level, compact and seal the solid wastes at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe site. The garbage was estimated to be 230 feet deep in some places, forming enormous cliffs from the refuse deposited there for more than four decades. <PERSON> Homero </PERSON> <PERSON> Aridjis </PERSON>, a poet and president of the Group of 100 environmental activists, said the project `` is important because the garbage is not only a pollution problem but also a social problem.'' The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area, the world's largest with 18 million people, is considered by experts to have the world's worst air pollution. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> dump, releasing bacteria into the air, posed a health hazard to the trash pickers -LRB- `` pepenadores,'' or scavengers, in Spanish -RRB- and residents of surrounding neighborhoods, some of the city's wealthiest. Spontaneous fires often broke out, sending noxious fumes into the air. There also was concern the wastes were seeping into aquifers and contaminating the city's already scarce water supply. Much of the trash has been covered over, but many pickers still live in their shacks amid the fly-covered refuse that remains at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. Nearby, the city has opened the other dump, <PERSON> Prados </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where some 2,500 tons a day of trash are unloaded. That site will be used, however, for just five years. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe pickers will be moved in the coming months and offered new houses outside the Prados de la <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> dump. The nearby <LOCATION> Tlayapaca </LOCATION> housing project, which will provide 510 two - and three-bedroom houses, with water, electricity and drainage systems, is to be completed in May `` With this action, the social evolution of that group of people will be achieved, improving their conditions of health and well-being and, as a result, their quality of life,'' the government said. <PERSON> Apolonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, whose family flattens milk cartons, stuffs them into plastic bags and sells them for recycling, said she would be glad to live in a cleaner place but is not so sure about moving from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. `` There is not as much pollution. There are not as many flies,'' she said of living somewhere else. But she expressed sadness at being forced out of a place that has been the family home since the area became a dump and concern about where her family would move. She said she had been told the new houses would cost 2 million to 3 million pesos apiece -LRB- about $ 870 to $ 1,300 -RRB-, a sum the family can not afford. `` We will have to go somewhere else,'' she said. However, <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>, chief of information for the city government, said the residents would have to pay only for water, electricity and other public services in the new homes. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> earns 80 pesos _ less than five cents _ for a 2.2-pound bag of paper. A week's work, she said, is worth 50,000 pesos or about $ 22. The government-set minimum wage is 8,000 pesos a day, or about $ 3.50. As she talked to a reporter, several of her 10 children sat nearby. A young boy played with a dirt-encrusted fruit pit. Two small girls, their faces and clothes covered with grime, listened quietly. Behind them, several of the stray dogs that roam the dump in packs scratched for scraps among flattened milk cartons waiting to be bagged. Over the years, some of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>'s residents arranged their shacks, made of the metal cut from oil drums, in rows, forming streets and some order in their lives. Their children studied at a primary school and took part in sports events on the weekends. About 200 families have already moved out of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to housing farther away from the sites, residents said. Some return to work at the new dump, but others are trying to find different jobs. Under new rules, the garbage pickers are allowed to enter the Prados de la <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> dump and pick trash from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, separating glass and plastic from paper and tin. They ca n't live there, and small children and pregnant women will be refused entry for health reasons After the workers leave at night, the unpicked rubbish is flattened and covered with dirt to prevent contamination. `` It's controlled,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Samano </PERSON>, a project engineer with the city ` s <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no flies, there is no smell.''

<TEXT>
 For nearly half a century, mountains, deserts and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' traffic could n't stop it _ that chugging, ungainly four-wheeled beast known as the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION>. But modern times have, and an era in the French auto industry has come to an end. The Deux Chevaux -LRB- French for two horses, or two horsepower -RRB- is a car, although some say it is an exaggeration to call it that _ tin can on wheels is more like it. The last one rolled off a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> assembly line Feb. 29 when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s oldest automobile factory, the Citroen plant in <LOCATION> Levallois </LOCATION>, shut down. There was hardly a whimper or a word in the press. Yet the closing of the plant on the western edge of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> signals the demise of the tortoise-shaped automotive with bulging headlights that look like a frog's eyes. So ends an institution as French as the beret or baguette. Whether rattling down a country road or careening across a city boulevard, with its side windows flapping on their hinges, the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> has long been part of the French landscape. Its snail's pace and its noisy chugs have endeared millions, spawning <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> fan clubs worldwide `` When the last car left the factory in <LOCATION> Levallois </LOCATION>, you can say it was the end of an era,'' said <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeg </PERSON>, a Citroen spokeswoman. `` But you ca n't say it is the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION>.'' The car will continue to be manufactured in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, but at less than half the 1987 rate, when 43,255 <PERSON> Deux </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevaux </PERSON> were turned out. `` I do n't have great patriotic sentiment, but it's the only car with a French identity,'' said three-time <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Collignon </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Deux </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevaux </PERSON> was conceived as an affordable car for those of modest means. When it first came out the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> cost the franc equivalent of about $ 650. The two latest models cost $ 6,500 and $ 7,460. Like sensible shoes, the buggy with bed-spring suspension, a simple engine, no `` extras,'' is functional in the extreme. And allegedly indestructible. Funny looking to some people, downright ugly to others, the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> is simply `` beyond beauty,'' says Citroen. In the 1960s, <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION>'s heyday, it became a reverse status symbol among the rebellious young. `` It's more than a car,'' said <PERSON> Collignon </PERSON>. `` Everyone who has one has a more or less sentimental relationship with it. `` The big advantage is that it can be completely falling apart, broken all over, and it keeps running. It has an incredible life.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> has set altitude and depth records for a car _ climbing to 17,180 feet on <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chacaltaya </LOCATION> in 1953 and down deep into a salt mine in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> region. Two Frenchmen, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Seguela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Baudot </PERSON>, made an 87,000-mile round-the-world trip in a <LOCATION> Deux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chevaux </LOCATION>, once resorting to crushed bananas to replace oil lost from a broken gearbox during a 200-mile desert stretch. `` Four wheels under an umbrella'' was the order to engineers working on the design in the 1930s, according to <ORGANIZATION> Citroen </ORGANIZATION>, which later touted it as `` the most minimum car.'' A wooden model was produced in 1936. World War II intervened, and the car was not formally unveiled until October 1948 at the Paris Auto show. Originally available only in gray, with a top speed of 37 miles an hour, today's <PERSON> Deux </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevaux </PERSON> streak by in all colors, or even two-tone, and can reach a top speed of 72 mph. The upgraded engine remains mechanically elementary and the horsepower has increased from two to three. Citroen brochures call the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> `` a mechanical phenomenon, a commercial phenomenon, a sociological phenomenon.'' But the truth, Ms. <PERSON> Hoeg </PERSON> concedes, is that the car is outmoded. `` Orders have fallen a lot,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` The European market is increasingly closed to the <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> because of pollution norms.'' Strict pollution controls, for example, have effectively banned the car from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> since October 1987. It has not been sold in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> since 1968 and in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> since 1982 because it does n't come up to their safety standards. <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> fans in other countries are expected to be deprived of the car in the coming years, Ms. <PERSON> Hoeg </PERSON> said. No effort was ever made to sell it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but she said she understands there are some Deux Chevaux collectors there. The closing of the <LOCATION> Levallois </LOCATION> plant, built in 1893, is part of an overall retrenchment of the French auto industry. At its peak in the mid-1960s, the plant turned out 550 <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> a day, compared to 80 a day last year. The Citroen plant in <LOCATION> Manguade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, manufacturing <ORGANIZATION> Deux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevaux </ORGANIZATION> since 1982, is expected to produce about 20,000 in 1988.

 <PERSON> Nawal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akiki </PERSON> wept as the ferryboat Empress left the dock, the lights of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> twinkling in the darkness, masking <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s scars and suffering. It was her last sight of her troubled homeland. With her husband, <PERSON> Elie </PERSON>, and their two sons, she was getting away from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s violence and economic chaos of 13 years of civil war for a new life in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. For <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 900,000 Christians, penned up in a enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by the war, the 8,187-ton Empress and its sister ship, the Sunny Boat, are their only way out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport is in Moslem-controlled territory on the other side of the capital's dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> and is unsafe for Christians. <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 13 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, is the Christians' only passenger port Mrs. <PERSON> Akiki </PERSON> spent the entire voyage staring out of a porthole, sometimes weeping as she sailed into an unknown future in a strange land. The white-painted Empress and the Sunny Boat shuttle between <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on the south coast of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> every day with bizarre cargoes of humanity, dispirited Lebanese, commuting businessmen, security agents, gamblers, and sometimes hashish runners. During the nine-hour night-time voyage across the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the Empress becomes <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in microcosm, mirroring the despair and hopelessness of its feuding people. In the lounge, a band pounds out pop tunes. In the all-night casino, Lebanese high-rollers crowd around the roulette and blackjack tables and the bank of a dozen slot machines. The action never stops. But few are few winners, said one of the croupiers, identifying himself only as <PERSON> Tanious </PERSON>. `` These people drop thousands of dollars every night. It's amazing Some of them are regulars on the boat and they rarely get off ahead of the game.'' Before he joined the Empress last summer, <PERSON> Tanious </PERSON> said, he was a fighter with the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia. So was <PERSON> Elias </PERSON>, 24, one of the crewmen. He said he took the $ 100-a-month job `` because I do n't want to fight any more.'' <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> said he has been wounded three times fighting Moslems and leftists in the war. `` I want to get out for good, but no one will give me a visa. One of these days maybe I'll meet an American lady, or an English lady, on the boat and I'll marry her and get myself a new passport.'' <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> and one of his friends among the 200-member crew admitted that part of their job is to gather information for the Lebanese Forces about travelers heading for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. With <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> increasingly used by the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s underground organizations, foreign intelligence agencies, gunrunners and drug smugglers, the Empress and the Sunny Boat attract the attention of Lebanese and Cypriot authorities as well. Passengers are checked and closely questioned by the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security officials and <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police during the voyage. Cypriot customs officers regularly arrest Lebanese for drug-smuggling after the ferryboats dock, although they admit the big rings use high-speed boats to ship their hashish and heroin grown in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The Empress is well known in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. It evacuated <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The following year, it carried <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas when they were pushed out of their last Lebanese stronghold in the northern port of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> by Syrian-backed dissidents. In December, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunboats intercepted it and forced it to turn back to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> because they suspected it was carrying Palestinian guerrillas to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as part of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s effort to rebuild his onetime power base. Lebanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate that as many as 1 million Lebanese have been granted emigration visas in the last three years. Businessman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was heading for <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> aboard the Empress to catch a plane for <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> after receiving initial acceptance as an immigrant from Canadian authorities. Two of his brothers have lived in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> for three years and he was going to take a look at the country where he and his family will make their new home. `` What's it like in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>?'' he asked <PERSON> Akiki </PERSON>, also bound for <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> with his family. `` I hear it's really cold in winter and I'm worried if my children will able to bear it there.'' `` Anything's better than the gunbattles and shelling, the power cuts,'' <PERSON> Akiki </PERSON> replied. `` I want a better life for myself and my family.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks in saffron robes stop in the middle of a downtown street to meditate. Mechanics work at keeping rusty <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> Beetles running. Panes are missing from windows in government buildings. Just about everything needs a coat of paint. This is <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> 13 years after Communist forces took it over during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> War. It is more like a sleepy village than a national capital. In contrast to virtually every urban center in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, its population has decreased, from nearly 200,000 at the war's end in 1975 to 100,000 now. Virtually no construction has taken place under the Communists, who are trying to cope with one of the most meager economies in the world. The landlocked country's per capita income hovers around $ 160 a year. <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s tallest building is the seven-story Ministry of Culture, built more than 15 years ago. It faces a water fountain that has no water. Only a few traffic lights are seen along the main streets, which before 1975 bustled with Chinese merchants. Some of their shops are now closed, their owners having joined the exodus of more than 300,000 from a country with a population of less than 4 million. This small population and relatively abundant agricultural land have helped avoid the hunger and poverty found in some other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. In <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, at least, there is evidence of the good life for some. At the sprawling, open-air marketplace, vendors display a wide variety of consumer goods, mostly from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which lies just across the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> boundary. Prices for Thai jeans, toothpaste and other basic items are only slightly higher than across the river. Although <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> is closely linked with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, another neighbor, and has attempted to establish close economic ties with it, a large quantity of Laotian imports and exports still pass through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Thais and Laotians share racial and cultural bonds and despite the Laotian government's its attempts to veer away from pro-Western <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, residents of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> read Thai magazines, gossip about Thai movie stars and tune in to Thai television. There is also a lingering influence of the French, onetime colonial masters in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Apart from the French-style residences, one can still buy tasty French bread and frequent such establishments as <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fantaisie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tailor </ORGANIZATION> and hairdressing salons with French names. Even a big billboard advertising the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> and `` its more than 160 worldwide destinations,'' is written in French, although hundreds of Soviet advisers are in the country and some attempt is made to teach Russian in schools. But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Soviet way of life seem very distant from languid <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight SU553 flies directly from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> once a week but it does not pick up passengers on its return. Despite strident Marxist calls to greater efforts at national reconstruction, the old <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> of temple bells and the `` bo pen yang'' -LRB- `` never mind, take it easy'' -RRB- lifestyle appears in some degree to have survived. Near the 16th century monastery of That Luang, barefoot boys plau around an ancient frangipani tree in bloom as their mothers pass the day chatting. Evidently intact is the traditional hospitality of Laotians. Although Western journalists are rarely granted visas, once admitted they are invariably greeted with the smiles, patience and small kindnesses. By far the largest group of journalists to visit <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> _ 55 Thais and other foreigners _ were entertained with dances and a magic show and fed exotic food as they accompanied <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> for a 27-hour visit recently. <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> was leading a Thai military delegation trying to patch up relations after the bloodiest border fighting between the two countries since 1975. At <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Laksi </LOCATION> restaurant, overlooking the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the visitors were served pangolin stew, a concoction of onions, wild mushrooms and dark meat of the toothless anteater. The Laotians reportedly went out of their way to capture the animal and prepare the delicacy for military officers they had been fighting a week earlier.

<TEXT>
 Movie producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> likes to tell stories about the little guy pursuing a goal despite seemingly insurmountable odds. His first movie in 1979, `` Running,'' was about a middle-aged man determined to run in the Olympics. `` The <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' a television movie for Home Box Office, told of a youth who ran across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> despite losing a leg to cancer. `` The <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> Story: Murderers Among Us'' will follow the story of a man who devoted 40 years of his life to tracking down Nazi war criminals. And `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'' will show a survivor of the Holocaust who is finally reunited with the woman he loves, but because of a twist of fate can not testify against the Nazi who brutalized them both. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has pursued his own goals against the odds. At 5-foot-4, he describes himself as a little guy out to prove himself. He grew up in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, where he abandoned his goal of acting to become a lawyer after his father was threatened by gangsters. He set up a storefront law firm, then became a prosecutor fighting organized crime. He later spent six years as host of a Canadian television show called `` Ombudsman,'' which looked into complaints of injustice by its viewers. `` The theme of the little guy against the odds has always appealed to me, not only in my films but in my own life,'' he said. `` I think because of my size I developed an early sensitivity to injustice. It's the <PERSON> David </PERSON> and Goliath thing, although some people tell me I use the sling a little too often.'' `` The <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> Story'' goes into production for <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on May 2. Academy Award winner <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> -LRB- `` Gandhi'' -RRB- stars in the title role of the four-hour miniseries. `` You've got to do something about a man who's been obsessed for 40 years,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. `` I told <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> I wanted to know why he did what he did when everyone else had come to terms with the Holocaust. He had stayed in a time warp in the 1940s. He was the man who found <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON> and -LRB- found -RRB- the man who arrested <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will also film a Wiesenthal book called `` Max and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>,'' which tells of the only time <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON> let a Nazi war criminal go. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and the woman he loved, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, were brutalized in a Nazi camp by an SS officer who was found living free in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Max </PERSON> refuses to testify. `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> tells <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to ` get in my skin,''' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` He tells of how he and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> were in the same camp, but were separated. In 1945 he was able to escape, but was imprisoned another 10 years by the Russians. In 1955 he finally found <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` But <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> had a son who was the image of the Nazi SS officer. He had raped her repeatedly in camp and freed her when she became pregnant. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> ca n't marry her. Her son reminds him of the Nazi. Yet, he wo n't testify because the son thinks he's Jewish and does n't know who his real father is.'' Later, the son grows a beard and moves to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> marry, but within a few weeks <PERSON> Max </PERSON> kills himself. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also has these projects in the works: _ `` Inspector <PERSON> Maigret </PERSON>,'' which is being filmed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maigret </PERSON> has been described as a sort of French Columbo. The show is for syndication. _ `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' a four-hour miniseries for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, tells of an American family living in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> from 1900 until <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> takes over in 1959. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> hopes to be able to film it in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> model <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, whose face was slashed in a knife attack arranged by her landlord and former makeup man `` My interest is the fact that she was slashed by her makeup man, whose job was to make her beautiful,'' he said. `` Why did he do it? That's what fascinates me. That and the story of a woman who was told all her life she is beautiful _ then loses it.''

<HEAD>Semiconductor Shortage Is Outcome of Bad Policy</HEAD>

 American electronics companies are starved for computer chips. Japanese chip makers are raking in windfall profits. And nobody seems quite sure what to do. This is the way of the world in the electronics industry, circa March 1988. It did n't have to be this way. The current worldwide shortage in computer chips is a classic manifestation of the Law of Unintended Consequences, one that has resulted in higher prices of electronic products and even delays in the introduction of some new computers. One big reason for the shortage is unobjectionable: Booming sales of personal computers and the retooling for a new generation of memory chips have combined to produce a cyclical squeeze on production capacity. But another reason for the shortage is that a 1986 chip agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has backfired in a way that should have been predictable. The accord, intended to benefit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip makers, was supposed to keep the Japanese from `` dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices while giving the Americans better access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge market. What actually came about was the creation of a de facto semiconductor cartel _ a legalized form of collusion that had the effect of setting prices above market levels and carving up markets. The Japanese did raise prices of memory chips, mainly by limiting production, but the main beneficiaries were just two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and tiny <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> are the only American companies still selling dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, and they are earning a windfall. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are paying more for chips than their foreign rivals pay. The consequences of that over the long term are disquieting. As for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to the Japanese market, it is not happening. It was reported in January that foreigners' share of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market had fallen every month since June. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Americans are bumping their heads against a concrete ceiling. For one thing, the biggest consumers of chips in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are also the biggest producers. It is unlikely they will buy from Americans when they can take chips right off their own fabrication lines, although pressure on them should be continued. Most worrisome in the long run is that the high prices Japanese chip makers are fetching under the accord is giving them even more money to pour into their world-leading research and development. In exactly the same way that Japanese automakers responded to `` voluntary'' restraints by moving upscale with cars like the Honda Acura, Japanese chip makers are beginning to move upscale with more complex, expensive chips that have been the domain of the Americans. So what needs to be done? The main job, obviously, is to rebuild the American chip industry so it can compete with the Japanese without the need for a de facto cartel. The 1986 accord has already been legally challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> seems to be a step in the right direction. The organization, to be based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is financed by government and industry and will work to improve manufacturing techniques, which are considered the Achilles' heel of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip makers. A bigger problem is that many of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' leading chip makers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are only mid-sized companies that lack the deep pockets to compete with Japanese giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip buyers such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry a financial shot in the arm by buying the chip makers, but they have shown little interest in the volatile and expensive business More mergers of chip companies almost surely lie ahead. The federal government may even serve as matchmaker in some cases. But two of the most worthwhile steps to help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip business _ and thus the electronics business _ have nothing to do with integrated circuits per se. Step one would be to lower the cost of borrowing for the capital-intensive industry by cutting the federal budget deficit. Step two would be to improve the quality of American technical education, on which the industry depends. Those are long-term steps, to be sure. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not get where it is by concentrating on the short term.

<HEAD>A Walk In The Zoo With An Actor-Knight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Hello dear. You're very handsome. Yes you are,'' Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> coos through the cage at a rhinoceros. `` You've got a sweet face, very pretty ears,'' the elder statesman of British acting says, as he strolls through <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s central <PERSON> Zoologischen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garten </PERSON> His chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades as one of the world's finest, most chameleon-like talents. On this particular day, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Film Festival was awarding the 73-year-old Guinness its special `` Ehren Bear'' -LRB- honorary bear -RRB- for lifetime achievement in the cinema. The actor, however, elected to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a romp in the zoo. `` I'm not actually that keen on them; I hate to see certain animals caged up,'' he said. `` But I remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively laid out on the open plan, and I thought it might be amusing to have a second look.'' He last visited the <PERSON> Zoologischen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garten </PERSON> 14 years ago. Images of some of the zoo's reported stock of 10,000 animals have lingered: `` They used to have white rhinoceroses there that were charming. And a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds _ an old thing that was like a symbol of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>; a splendid, great creature.'' This time around, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' observations are as keen as ever, whether applied to the varieties of zoo-bound species or the special tributes that have marked his career. In 1980, he received a special Academy Award to honor a range of work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister <PERSON> Fagin </PERSON> in `` Oliver Twist'' -LRB- 1948 -RRB-, a comic octet of murder victims in `` Kind Hearts and Coronets'' -LRB- 1950 -RRB-, the hard-driving Colonel <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> in `` The Bridge on the River Kwai'' -LRB- 1957 -RRB-, the aging mystic <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Obi-Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenobi </PERSON> in `` Star Wars'' -LRB- 1977 -RRB- and its sequels. Last year, he was twice feted in lavish galas _ in April at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> and in May at the Cannes Film Festival. The occasion in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> may be less tony, but its significance is no less clear: in the Festival's 38 years, <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> is only the second actor to be so honored, following <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> in 1982. `` I'm afraid when you get rather elderly, these things seem to come on you rather more than you might wish,'' he says, his brisk gait belying his years, his nose becoming slightly red in the seasonal chill. A signpost draws his attention: `` I think that way may be the pheasantry. Do you mind if we go in there?'' Somewhere between pheasants and finches, the conversation turns to work. His latest project is `` Little Dorrit,'' the six-hour film adaptation of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' novel in which he plays <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrit </PERSON>, a long-term inmate of a debtor's prison who finds that sudden wealth brings sudden freedom. Guinness had not performed <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> since the 1940s, when he both adapted `` Great Expectations'' for the stage and made his movie debut as <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pocket </PERSON> in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lean </PERSON>'s 1946 film version. He then appeared in `` Oliver Twist'' in 1948. He considers `` Little Dorrit'' to be one of <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' two or three greatest novels. `` Dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go over the top,'' he said. Later this year, he'll be seen as Mr. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> in a movie of <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>'s 1934 novel, `` A Handful of Dust.'' Then there's <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON>'s current Broadway play, `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' which Guinness may do on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage. He last trod the West End boards in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s `` The Old Country'' in 1977-8. `` It's a very distinguished piece of writing,'' he says of the play. But Guinness acknowledges its pitfalls, as well: `` The amount of learning for a two-hander is horrendous. An actor's great fear is that he wo n't have the memory.'' On that topic, he is emboldened by the recent return to the stage, after a decade away, of his friend and mentor, Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, in the new play `` The Best of Friends.'' `` <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> is 83,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> says matter-of-factly, `` and he got through it -LRB- the play -RRB- very successfully.'' By now, the sky has clouded over, and rain looks likely. Guinness has a lunch date for which he must n't be late, so he returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived. `` There they are,'' he says, sounding resigned as the anonymity of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans' ever-ready pens and cameras. But before leaving the zoo, he has one last remark about rhinos: `` We're told they have very nice personalities.'' He takes an inimitable pause. `` But I do n't think I'd like to encounter them intimately.''

<HEAD>The Name Lavrenti Beria Still Brings Chills to Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lavrenti </PERSON> <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>. The mere mention of the name stills brings chills to some Soviets. In the 1960s, years after his death, people still avoided walking past his drab mansion at 28 <ORGANIZATION> Kachalov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> because of the terrible memories it might evoke. Now, 34 years after <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s own execution, the mansion houses the <ORGANIZATION> Tunisian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Abderraouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ounaies </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> said there were stories that <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> had a dungeon built in the basement and a secret passageway. Some areas of the basement could have been used as a dungeon, <PERSON> Ounaies </PERSON> said, but he found no evidence of that they actually were used for that, nor was there evidence of a secret passageway. The curse seems to have worn off. People these days walk by, apparently without giving a thought to <PERSON> Lavrenti </PERSON> <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, the balding, small Georgian who wore pince-nez and is held responsible for the executions of millions during the Stalin era. `` Every generation has its horrors,'' said an elderly neighborhood woman, who recalled seeing <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> strolling outside the mansion when he lived there. The administration of General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says it wants the current generation of Soviets to know the truth about the past, and is reviving nightmares about <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> and the machine of terror he ran in the late 1930s and 1940s as <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s most ruthless and powerful henchman Press articles and the portrayal of a Beria-Hitler-like character in the recent Georgian movie `` Repentance'' are part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempts to fill in `` blank spots'' in history _ formerly taboo subjects. He believes that extending his policy of glasnost, or openness, to the crimes of the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era will help ensure that such mistakes are not repeated. The effort parallels <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to rid Soviet society of Stalinist policies under which the central government exercised tight control over the economy. <PERSON> Sergo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON>, the son of the late <PERSON> Anastas </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> who had served with <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> leadership, wrote Feb. 21 in the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> that it is important to review <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> `` to finally free the future from the past.'' <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s legacy is the image of the state security forces as all-powerful and ruthless. In their re-examination of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, Soviet media have not touched on this image as it pertains to the present-day <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, successor to <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>. Also conspicuously absent is any criticism of the system that enabled such a pair to take charge and to operate their machine of terror for so long. This is not the first time the official media have focused on <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s reign of terror. He was first exposed during <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s de-Stalinization drive in the 1950s and 60s. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, in his memoirs _ published only in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> _ called <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> `` a butcher and an assassin,'' a `` beast'' who was `` without the slightest trace of human decency'' and who was `` very skillful at anything that was filthy and treacherous.'' Although <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> was sharply condemned during <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s years, the early official accounts inacurrately described his relationship with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` We refused to believe that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> himself could have been behind the terror which <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> oversaw,'' <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> wrote. `` For a while, we gave the party and the people incorrect explanations about what had happened; we blamed everything on <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>. He was a convenient figure.'' The truth, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> said, was that `` <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> did n't create <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>; <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> created <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>.'' Only now, under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, is the official record being corrected, with the help of <PERSON> Sergo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> and the sons of other members of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s Politburo, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malenkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malenkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> are quoted in a recent edition of <LOCATION> Nedelya </LOCATION>, a weekly supplement to the <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. That and the other articles put the blame squarely on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` I believe that the roots of <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s evil deeds should be sought in the personality of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> rather than in <LOCATION> Beria </LOCATION> himself,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhusyenin </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Nedelya </LOCATION>. `` Namely the cult, the deviation from Leninist norms, resulted in the <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> phenomenon. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> was able to guess <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s wishes, was able to exploit the weaknesses of his master for personal profit and self-glorification.'' <PERSON> Zhusyenin </PERSON> said that when he interviewed people, `` their arms began to tremble at the very mention of the name <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>.''

 The writers of the recent articles said they had trouble researching <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> because he did such a good job of covering his tracks, making sure that any evidence that could be used against him was destroyed and witnesses killed. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> stated the new evaluation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> in its headline over <PERSON> Sergo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON>'s article: `` The Servant <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, a fellow Georgian, to be deputy head of the already-dreaded <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, as the state security and police force was known at the time, in the summer of 1938. By year's end, <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> replaced <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yezhov </PERSON>, who had fallen out of favor with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and was executed in 1940. The people breathed a sigh of relief, hoping that the years of bloody mass purges were behind them. Mass arrests did end, but the terror continued. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> simply made it more selective, playing on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s paranoia by identifying and eliminating those deemed to be `` enemies of the people.'' In the meantime, he garnered a staggering amount of power. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> became the first secret police chief elevated to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo. During World War II, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> named <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> to the committee supervising defense and later put him in charge of developing a Soviet atomic bomb. After the war, <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> controlled the regular and secret police, the country's labor camps, propaganda and transport, as well as a private empire in his native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and surrounding regions. Among the horrors Western historians link to <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> was the massacre of more than 4,000 Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> troops in April 1940. The official Soviet version is that the Poles were killed by Germans. On a personal level, Soviet accounts of <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> said he interrogated and executed prisoners himself. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> raped teen-age girls after having them kidnapped off the streets. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s intrigues also took a heavy toll on the party itself. <PERSON> Nedyelya </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> collected files on every government leader, including <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, for possible use against them. His victims included veteran party members, comrades-in-arms of V.I. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and officials of the party youth group <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nedyelya </PERSON> said. Even <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> began to fear <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, and by 1946 had taken away all his henchman's security posts. But <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> retained unofficial control over the security organs, and planned to use his forces to seize power after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death in March 1953. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, in his memoirs and in remarks cited Feb. 24 in <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, said he was aware of <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s ambitions and suggested privately to the other top leaders in the summer of 1953 that they oust <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>. They agreed. The Politburo, in <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s presence, met and voted to arrest him Military troops outside <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>'s control took him to prison. He was put on trial, convicted of being a British agent _ a dubious charge _ and of trying to `` elevate the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> above the party and government in order to seize power.'' Official accounts say he was executed Dec. 23, 1953, but some Western historians believe he was put to death months earlier. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>, who had been in the limelight for 14 years, quickly became a non-person. The editors of the official Soviet encyclopedia, for example, told readers to paste an article about the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> over one about <PERSON> Beria </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Conservationists Oppose Dam for Thailand's Last Virgin Forest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>THUNG YAI SANCTUARY, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` This is our last forest,'' said ranger <PERSON> Veerawat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dheeraprasart </PERSON>, pointing down a deep river valley. `` If the dam is built here, all this will vanish, and nobody will ever be able to replace it.'' Veerawat, the chief ranger of this rich wildlife sanctuary astride the border with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, is among thousands who have joined what unquestionably has become the greatest environmental battle in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s history _ a fight to persuade the government not to build a dam in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s last virgin forest. In a country that once was jungle-carpeted and teeming with wildlife, it is rare today to see a tract of undisturbed forest, an unpolluted river, white-handed gibbons or free-ranging tigers. Anti-dam groups have held rock concerts and demonstrations, some featuring life-like models of crucified animals, in their campaign. Newspapers are probing the issue in unprecedented detail. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kukrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Pramoj </PERSON> says the government could face a mass uprising if it approves the Nam Choan dam. The dam's proponents say Nam Choam needs to be built, in what is the largest remaining area of protected forest in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, to increase <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s energy supply by about 2 percent. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has described the proposed, 580-megawatt dam as the `` last possible exploitable source of hydro power'' in the country. It says it will create a reservoir that would also help irrigate farm land and assure water supplies in times of drought. The projected dam site is still hard to get to: a lurching, nine-hour drive over dirt roads from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, the Thai capital, followed by a four-hour jungle trek. When monsoons lash the countryside, a three-day elephant ride offers the only access. But dam opponents claim construction of <LOCATION> Nam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Choan </LOCATION>, with the necessary approach roads, facilities and ensuing human encroachment, would spell doom for what they say is also the last area in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> large enough to ensure the survival of a wide variety of wildlife. Found in the <PERSON> Thung </PERSON> <PERSON> Yai </PERSON> and the adjacent <PERSON> Huay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kha </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaeng </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanctuary </PERSON>, an area about the size of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, are large mammals, such as elephant, gaur, tiger and clouded leopard; some 350 species of birds, and a wide range of plant life. A number of the species are classified as endangered in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, some worldwide. Foreign conservation groups have written letters expressing concern to the Thai government. In December, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, urged an independent environmental impact study before a final decision is reached. A similar plea came from more than 1,300 conservationists and scientists at the general assembly in February of the Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources. The <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> maintains that <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Choan </PERSON> would degrade only 4 percent of the area. But ranger <PERSON> Veerawat </PERSON>, who has served for 10 years in the sanctuary, contends the 47-mile-long dam reservoir would not only eradicate a biologically vital riverine valley but also disrupt the migration routes of animals, forcing them into smaller habitats. Opponents also dispute the 4 percent degradation estimate, saying that in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> roads built into remote, forested areas have inevitably been followed by massive logging, with collusion between businessmen and corrupt officials circumventing protective legislation. Loggers are already felling the rich forests along the park boundary. <PERSON> Pisit </PERSON> na Patalung, secretary-general of Wildlife Fund <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, one of some 30 private organizations opposing the proposal, said the dam issue has raised an environmental awareness among Thais. Until recent years, the public appeared apathetic as the country's once teeming wildlife was slaughtered and forests that blanketed about 70 percent of the country a generation ago were reduced to around 15 percent of total area today The dam was first proposed in the early 1970s but plans were shelved in 1983 in wake of protests and charges that environmental impact studies were sloppy and improper. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> asked that the project be reconsidered and the government appointed a 40-man committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Thienchai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirisamphan </PERSON> to come up with a decision, which is expected soon. Some opponents believe government leaders will be impressed by their arguments that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> now has enough alternate energy sources, including offshore natural gas and lignite, to scrap the dam proposal. Others, however, feel that too many key bureaucrats and politicians are still little concerned over environmental problems. Another wildlife ranger, <PERSON> Sueb </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakhasathien </PERSON>, did n't sound optimistic. `` Thais have n't yet put a price on the environment,'' he said. `` They do n't realize that trees and water have a price, that wildlife has a price.''

 When the farmworkers union failed to persuade civilian officials to remove <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinal </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, it took its case to the armed forces chief. In going to Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> and the military high command the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campesinos </ORGANIZATION> made plain its feeling, shared by others, that real power in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> does not lie with the civilian government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>. The union is seeking <PERSON> Espinal </PERSON>'s ouster from the Cabinet-level post on grounds that he was stalling on agrarian reform. <PERSON> Espinal </PERSON>, nevertheless, remains in his post, confirmed once again by <PERSON> Azcono </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, and so far as is known <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> has not acted. The campesinos' tactic was also used in the past few years by bus drivers, teachers, business leaders and other sectors. It underscores the powerful, even dominant, role still exercised by the armed forces six years after <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> restored civilian government. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has a long history of military governments, most recently in the 1972-82 period. `` The people know where the source of power lies,'' said <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Puerto </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a critic of <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>'s administration. Even government supporters acknowledge the imbalance of power. `` Longstanding vices are not gotten rid of from the night to the morning,'' said <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he said consolidation of civilian power `` is coming along well.'' But he also observed, `` Here, as in all countries, interests are managed according to the real powers. And if those powers are ambitious, we could fall again into old vices.'' `` No Honduran politician is going around saying, ` We've got to put the military back in the box,' because here the military never has been in the box,'' said a Western diplomat. Compared to its neighbors, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has enjoyed a degree of stability and peace during a decade of regional conflict. But the civil wars surrounding it have caused big problems. `` We have become a sanctuary,'' said <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' tens of thousands of refugees from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, all torn by guerrilla wars `` We are victims of the entry into our country of irregular forces.'' He referred to the Contras, who since 1982 have been trying to topple the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Until last year, a Contra force estimated at 6,000 to 12,000 men had waged the better part of the campaign from base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border. The rebels say most of their forces are now inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. By congressional vote, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has cut off further military aid, damaging prospects for long-term effectiveness inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` There is a great concern that the Contras, if defeated, will try to come back here,'' said <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> told journalists in February he hoped the Contras would be able to keep up their fight but said if they can not, they are not welcome back in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` We have instructed immigration authorities along the border to ensure that they do not return,'' he said. Puerto sees a connection between the Contra problem and continued military preponderance in Honduran politics. Citing <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' very strong alliance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said: `` To whom does the Honduran army owe its allegiance? Everything indicates it owes its allegiance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and not to its own people.'' He said civilian government and close alignment with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had done little to alleviate the poverty of hundreds of thousands in this mainly agricultural country of 4.5 million people. `` People expected something different from civilian government, but they got more of the same,'' Puerto said. `` If things continue like this, people may lose faith in so-called democracy and look for other less desirable forms of struggle.'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> is past the midway point in the four-year term to which he was inaugurated in January 1986. Elections are scheduled in November 1989.

 New discoveries by American archaeologists indicate that humans could have settled on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> around 9000 B.C., 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. The finds also indicate that some species of ancient animals survived here at least 1,000 years after they were believed to have become extinct. If proven correct, the discoveries mean that <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was one of the earliest human settlements north of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, along with the island of <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, also in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` If these dates are corroborated, the site will have provided by far the earliest archaeological evidence for island colonization anywhere in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, reported in a recent lecture. Scientists had previously dated man's arrival on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> around 7500 B.C. But archaelogists digging on a slope near the sprawling British air base at <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' south coast recently found pygmy hippopotamus and dwarf elephant bones, some mixed with shells, flint and ash. Archaelogists believe the flint, an early cutting tool, was used to slice meat from the animals. The ash indicated cooking fires. Carbon dating placed the remains at around 9000 B.C., a millenium after those species of animals were believed to have died out. <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said that the animals, common to many <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> islands thousands of years ago, were wiped out by climatic changes during the last Ice Age that ended around 12,000 years ago. `` We thought ... these animals died out because of natural causes _ they could n't get enough food or enough water,'' <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said in an interview after the lecture. `` But now it looks as if man was also responsible for wiping them out.'' The <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION> excavation is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsors the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institute. The dig is under the direction of Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who currently is in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The original discovery was made in 1980 by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> security officer at <LOCATION> Akrotiri </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Pile </PERSON>, then a lieutenant, while he was training his men to seek out unusual objects. Underground excavation at the site, eight miles south of the port city of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>, started last July and will continue this summer. <PERSON> Swiny </PERSON> said the actual age of the site will remain questionable until results of further tests are obtained. The finds are only some of the important discoveries unearthed by American archaeologists in the last few years on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the center of trade routes between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for centuries. The island is studded with relics of a history that spans more than 10,000 years, during which more than a dozen civilizations, including Achaean Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Armenians, Venetians and Ottoman Turks left their imprint. Americans are involved in six of the 20 digs currently being made in the Greek-controlled southern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The Cyprus American institute provides logistical help at one sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, at the Late Bronze Age town of <LOCATION> Kalavasos-Ayios </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhimitrios </LOCATION>, 18 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Limassol </LOCATION>. It was one of the biggest Bronze Age settlements on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and a center for the island's ancient copper trade. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is the Phoenician word for copper. Last summer archaelogists uncovered the remains of a 13th century B.C. building, covering more than 10,764 square feet and once at least two stories high, that was apparently destroyed by fire. `` It's the biggest and most important building at the site and one of the biggest of that period in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> South </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, the dig's co-director. `` We also found some inscriptions which are very rare to the period in Cypro-Minoan script,'' she added. Cypro-Minoan, which resembles the script used in <LOCATION> Minoan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> 4,000 years ago, has never been deciphered. The presence of these inscriptions and the huge storage capacity of the building, known as Building X, suggest it was either a palace or a town hall. The storage room, more than 60 feet long and 24 feet wide, consists of an outer wall and six stone pillars that once supported the roof. The shards of at least 47 jars, some once as tall as six feet, have been found. All apparently had been smashed in the fire. But six intact jars were later discovered in pits below the floor. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> discovered a tomb, considered one of the richest and best preserved ever found on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, while digging an exploratory trench out from the building. The oval-shaped tomb contained the skeletons of three young women, a child about 3 years old and three infants. They apparently had social status and wealth. The women had been buried with gold and silver jewelry, bronze and bone artifacts, containers of wine with small cups inside and cylindrical ivory cosmetic boxes.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> says he has been burned and tempered since leaving the federal bench three years ago to become the top lawyer at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a job that keeps him in the heat of the battle over `` Star Wars,'' the Iran-Contra affair and other controversies. `` If it helps to go through fire, I was helped,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, 49, says he faces an uncertain future after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office, and is bitter about criticism he received from lawmakers for what is called the `` broad interpretation'' of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. His interpreration, which would have allowed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to accelerate the development and testing of missile defenses using lasers and other exotic weapons, provoked angry outcries from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who voted last year to bar the administration from spending any money that would violate the `` restrictive interpretation.'' `` I hope that people consider me to be respectable and honorable some day for my work,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>. `` But it has been very rough to be attacked the way some people have attacked me,'' he said, referring to Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., of the Foreign Relations Committee `` Arms control is a very, very emotional subject,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>. `` I must say I was not clued in, in a sense, so it was a shock for me to run into that degree of criticism. I feel it was very unfair and unjustified.'' He was also involved in questioning <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials in the case of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, who was sentenced to life in prison for spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and has facilitated contacts between the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government and the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, interviewed in his office, indicated he might oppose efforts by the Iran-Contra independent counsel to subpoena testimony from two Israelis involved in the clandestine sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but that no final decision had been reached. As <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser, <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> heads a team of about 100 lawyers, and by all accounts has a warm relationship with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> was born on May 6, 1938, in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> to a family of Iraqi Jews, and came to this country in 1948. After attending law school, he served as clerk to <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Associate Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> in 1966-67, taught law at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> from 1969-79, and was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1979-85. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> gained national prominence as trial judge in the libel case brought by former Israeli Defense Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>. In an landmark verdict engineered by <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the jury found that Time made a factual error in reporting that a secret <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> report said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> had discussed revenge with Lebanese officials before massacres in two Palestinian refugee camps. But the jury said Time acted without malice, and was therefore not liable for monetary damages. `` Because of the way I handled the verdict, it turned out to be an important innovation in libel law,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, who proudly points out a sketch of the trial scene hanging on wall of his <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office. `` I liked being a judge very much,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>. `` I particularly liked trials.'' But, he said, `` I do n't have any expectation of returning to the bench. No one has invited me. I would certainly prefer that to being unemployed. I do n't expect to be unemployed.'' The truth is, he said, `` it's a possibility that I will have a lot of time on my hands'' after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> bridles at accusations that he devised legal rationales for controversial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies, such as Star Wars. `` I have said no to several things, plans, kidnappings, abductions, intrusions into the mail of other nations. There have been lots of things I have opposed successfully,'' he said. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> declined to disclose details of the kidnappings and abductions he opposed, but said that none had gone forward. He did support the abduction of <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a Lebanese suspected in the hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner on June 6, 1985. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was seized by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents in international waters off <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> last Sept. 13 and brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of all <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>'s actions, he probably will be remembered most for his broad interpretation of the ABM treaty. `` What happened was that Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and others jumped on this issue before we were done with all our work,'' said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>. `` The reason we were n't done with our work was because the broad interpretation was announced long before all the work was done, and before any decision to implement was made.'' The interpretation never was implemented. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then the White House National Security adviser, disclosed the broad interpretation on a television news show on Oct. 6, 1985. The ensuing controversy has centered on three main issues: _ Whether the treaty barred development of space-based or mobile anti-missile weapons based on `` other physical principles''' than those which existed in 1972 _ Whether remarks made by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials during ratification hearings in 1972 bound future administrations _ And whether the subsequent conduct of the superpowers bound them to the restrictive interpretation. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said he was `` not amazed'' by the outcry following <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s revelations. `` I am not naive. I realize that these people are motivated by their desire to win political battles, not to win legal arguments.'' Analysis of the ratification question had been prepared not by <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, but by junior attorneys on his staff, and was seized upon by SDI opponents. `` I had said three times -LRB- the ratification analysis -RRB- was inadequate and that I would have to come back and redo it. In fact, I was in the midst of redoing it'' when <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> disclosed the broad interpretation. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> has completed his review of the ABM treaty, and sticks by the broad interpretation, although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has closed the door for the time being. `` Now would be the time for a real debate on the ABM treaty,'' he said.

 Labor relations in the airline industry used to be fairly genteel and mutual accommodation was the rule. Then, after deregulation, came a competitive crunch, mergers and cost-cutting, and at many carriers snarl has replaced purr. A reporter surveys today's turbulent scene.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and several senior executives are fired after a closed-door deal with the airline's labor unions. Flight attendants trek to the suburban home of the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to register a protest about a strike that ended nearly two years ago. More than 4,000 of them are still looking to get their jobs back. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, expecting a strike, is planning for a small cargo carrier with non-union pilots to fly many of its passenger planes, prompting charges of union busting from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and mechanics. It's management and labor hardball, pure and simple. And it has become more frequent since the government eased out of regulating the airline industry in the early 1980s. Along with bitter competition among airlines have come increasingly acrimonious relations with labor. In the wars between airline workers and their bosses, the genteel atmosphere of bargaining _ common when the government had its reins on the industry _ seems to have gone the way of the propeller airplane. The hotbed of labor-management combat is at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the Miami-based airline that has struggled with huge losses and almost continuous labor turmoil for more than a decade. The company wants major concessions. The unions say they're being pushed into a strike. When word came recently that 26 Eastern jets were being leased to a little known cargo operator named <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the news unleashed a firestorm among many of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s employees. It was no secret that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, in the midst of stormy contract talks with its mechanics, intends in event of a strike this summer to have non-union <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> pilots fly the leased planes on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s most critical routes. `` It's an attempt to decimate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s cockpit crews,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of the airline's pilots union. There are hints from the parent 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of a one-day nationwide shutdown of air service if Eastern ever uses the Orion pilots. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for human relations, calls the non-union <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> pilots `` our insurance coverage.'' Corporate hardball. `` Prior to deregulation, for maybe 20 years, there was a posture of accommodation. The unions accepted the companies and the companies accepted the unions. Government generally was neutral or slightly on the side of labor,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassels </PERSON>, a professor of industrial relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. When labor wanted more money, the airlines often agreed. They knew that the government would pass the increased costs on in the form of higher fares. Today, airlines compete vigorously on fares and have argued that one of their biggest problems has been high labor costs. On average, 35 percent of airline operational costs are for labor, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, there has been `` a stage of outright hostility'' between labor and management in recent years, <PERSON> Cassels </PERSON> says. The tiff at Eastern may be the latest, but it's hardly the most bitter standoff between labor and management in recent years. It was in September 1983 that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nemesis of airline labor, stopped negotiating with the unions and shut down <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. He declared bankruptcy and shed the existing labor contracts. Three days later, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> emerged with pilots flying the same planes, but earning half the salary. Pilots and flight attendants saw their strike fizzle. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is larger than ever, but many of its one-time well-paid pilots are wearing the uniforms of other airlines and have lost much of their seniority and pay. In early 1986 the flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, faced with demands for sharp salary cuts, walked off their jobs and onto the picket lines. Today two-thirds of the 6,500 attendants who went on strike are still grounded. While the attendants await a recall from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, the airline continues to fly with a third fewer attendants who earn less money and work longer hours. Would the flight attendants again choose a strike? <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, who led the 1986 walkout, mulls the question over before answering. `` I do n't think we had a choice,'' she says. Attendants at other airlines may not have lost their jobs in recent years, but they have not been able to exert much clout. Recently, flight attendants were pushed reluctantly into a settlement at American and thought better of a strike at <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, where negotiations continue. But labor _ at least in terms of the more-powerful pilots and mechanics unions _ has flexed its muscles as well after several years of back-pedaling and reeling from management demands. Consider the fired <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> executives. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, with the blessing of fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> board of directors, resigned and sealed the deal with a handshake last January. He then walked into the office of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> and informed <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> they were fired. By the time the bloodletting was over, three senior vice presidents, including <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebey </PERSON>, who was in charge of labor relations, also were forced to resign. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> is now in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> `` assessing what he's going to do next.'' <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> recently was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to head its <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> can understand how they feel. A former hotel executive, <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> had a dream of turning <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into a broad-based travel company. While at the helm of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, he bought two hotel chains and a rental car company and envisioned one-stop shopping for transportation and lodging for businessmen.

 The name of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was changed to <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to broaden its appeal, but the moniker never caught on among Wall Street investors. It also served to highlight claims by the pilots that <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON> was siphoning money and attention from the airline. One evening last June, the company's board of directors demanded <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>' resignation. The pilots claimed responsibility. Although <PERSON> Ferris </PERSON>' fall may have been the result of a variety of forces, most industry analysts agree that his empire began to fail when the pilots union launched a $ 4.5 billion takeover bid, the first effort by a union to buy an entire airline. `` Anyone who thinks that the pilots union or the machinists today are the underdogs in one of these battles is clearly mistaken,'' says <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Indeed, pilots at many airlines have regained the momentum. Their salaries are on the upswing. The dual wage scales _ a lower one for newly hired pilots _ imposed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and widely copied by other carriers is showing signs of erosion. New contracts call for a more rapid merging of the two scales. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, caught unprepared and disorganized by the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy, has vowed never to be left so vulnerable again. Stiff increases in dues for its 40,000 members have brought $ 40 million into a war chest that continues to grow. The unions also say they will continue to take their fights into airline board rooms, citing their successes at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> where the pilots formed an unusual alliance with corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> two years ago to fend off <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Ironically, that set the stage for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, where labor war remains rife. Nevertheless, declares <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, `` Labor unions will continue to increase their Wall Street connections.'' `` Certainly in this day and age you wo n't get -LRB- salary or work rule -RRB- givebacks,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros </ORGANIZATION>. But he adds quickly that he would n't `` put the unions in the catbird seat'' just yet. Nowhere is that more true than at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based airline whose <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries account for 20 percent of the industry's market and which has led the trend toward lower airline fares. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> made his mark in 1972 when he bought debt-ridden <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and turned it around by unleashing `` peanut fares'' when business was slow. His low-fare strategy continued with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Air in 1981 and with the newly emerged Continental two years later. But to play out the strategy, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had to cut costs, a direct attack on labor. `` Does Frank like unions? That's not the issue,'' says <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s point man in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The issue is how does management get the flexibility to deal in a deregulated environment that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is dealing with.'' <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON> says that some members of the machinists union, especially ground workers who haul baggage, are earning salaries _ an average of $ 43,000 a year with fringes _ that are way too high. When <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> emerged with a non-union work force in 1983 it had cut its pilots' pay in half overnight. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> workers in 1986 earned on average $ 28,200 a year, the lowest in the industry, and better than a third lower than its chief competitors. Mechanics at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> earn $ 16 an hour base salary, $ 4 an hour lower than new contracts agreed to at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, according to the machinist union. In the third quarter of last year, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s labor costs were 22 percent of total operating costs, compared to about 35 percent industrywide. But <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> executives argue that low costs are needed if the airline is to survive and continue to provide the low fares that have opened air travel to millions of people. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, lost $ 466 million last year and its executives put much of the blame on costs related to absorbing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and the labor unrest at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, where losses were $ 182 million. Eastern president <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> has said he wants $ 490 million in labor concessions at the struggling airline. Union leaders countered that they have given back too much already and accuse <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of trying to dismember the airline. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, the pilot's leader at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, says that since <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> bought the airline he has: _ Sold <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s valuable computer reservation system to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> _ Cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to fly <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> routes if <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> chooses to _ Sold six <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A-300s and a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> _ Tried to spin-off <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s moneymaking Northeast air shuttle operation under a separate subsidiary `` He's taking the crown jewels, spinning them off and making them part of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> at Eastern. <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON> suggests the Eastern negotations have industrywide implications. `` We are now the last of the low-cost operators. People focus all of their attention on <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON> says. `` If the unions can defeat us, low fares go away and the pressure on wages at other airlines go away.''

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> always feared `` signing away his life.'' Even more, he dreaded revealing that he could n't read Then, about four years ago, <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> received a letter from a local hospital saying he owed a big bill for recent treatments. His nightmare had become reality. `` I told them I had Medicaid to take care of it, but they said I had agreed to pay the bill,'' <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> says. `` They said I had signed my name on the dotted line.'' Fortunately, the 42-year-old <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> was able to settle the dispute, but only after admitting to hospital officials that he really did n't know what he had signed because he could n't read. That was the catalyst <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> needed to seek help. No longer would <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> have to rely on his wife, children or siblings to explain service applications and contracts to him or read him the newspaper to him. Above all, he would be able to do the thing he had longed for most _ to be able to read his Bible for the sermons he gave to his Church of God in Christ congregation at <ORGANIZATION> Payton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. Over the years, family members had read the Bible to him. `` At first it was hard, but after a while I began to know by heart most of the verses I would use in my sermons,'' the minister says. `` I might not know the exact words, but I knew the exact feeling and that was easy to translate.'' <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> says it's painful to admit you ca n't read, `` But it opens a new way of life and you have to admit it to get help.'' Living in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, it was easy for <PERSON> Everson </PERSON> to find help. The city is the headquarters of two of the most successful organizations in the fight against illiteracy _ <ORGANIZATION> Laubach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, both part of a national campaign being conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- PLUS -RRB-. <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON> is the older of the two groups, founded in 1955 by the late <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON>, a missionary who spent 40 years traveling the globe teaching people how to read and write their native languages. <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON> became internationally recognized for his approach to illiteracy, the `` Laubach Method.'' Today, LLI has 750 councils in 45 states as well as an international program and publishing division. <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> housewife <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> was inspired by <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON>, who taught at <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the 1950s, and in 1962 she began a basement organization speaking out against illiteracy and teaching people to read. Today, nearly 300 LVA community affiliates comprise a network spanning 35 states. The organization has doubled in size in the last three years. Together, the two groups are responsible for teaching millions of Americans to read. Last year alone, both estimated they taught more than 100,000 adults how to read. Sadly, that only scratches the surface. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> says 27 million adults in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ one in every five _ ca n't read beyond a fourth-grade level. In some cases the consequences have been tragic. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mother fed undiluted formula to her nine-day old infant because she could n't read the directions. The baby died. The government estimates illiteracy costs the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about $ 225 billion annually in welfare payments, lost job productivity, unrealized earnings and tax revenues and crime. While illiteracy is predominantly a problem of poor <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, its victims include bankers, real estate brokers, firefighters, farmers, laborers and others, according to <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>. `` Do n't equate ignorance with illiteracy. People learn to get by,'' she says. `` They contrive ways to work around it because they are too embarrassed to let anyone know. Some people have remarkable memories, others fake poor eyesight and have others do their reading.'' However, the demands of today's high-tech society have made it harder. `` It's a national embarrassment,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, director of American programs for <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON>. `` Illiteracy is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most hidden problem, and its most solvable problem given adequate resources. Really, there's no good reason people who want to learn how to read and write ca n't do it. There are a dozen proven programs out there now.'' <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON> and Literacy Volunteers each have their own approach to teaching. Both are self-paced individual programs that specialize in mobilizing volunteers to serve as tutors. But <PERSON> Laubach </PERSON> teaches reading through a phonics-based system keyed on letter and word sound association, while Literacy Volunteers use a four-part method that incorporates phonics. The Literacy Volunteers approach also takes advantage of language experience, using the student's hobbies or interests to draw on as a basis to teach new words. Sight words and patterned words are other reading techniques employed by Literacy Volunteers. Sight words are those so basic to reading and encountered so often that they are best learned by sight, not by sounding them out, such as ` the,' ` have,' and ` were.' In the patterned words technique, which concentrates on vowel sounds, words are taught by learning families of words, such as ` man,' ` can,' ` fan.' `` It has n't been easy, but I do n't know why I did n't try and learn sooner,'' says <PERSON> Everson </PERSON>, who wants to become an LVA tutor as soon as he becomes proficient. `` The longer you wait, the worse it gets as far as dealing with the problem. Learning to read is like finding yourself.'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> say <PERSON> Everson </PERSON>'s story is a familiar one. `` It's interesting if you ask a student whose fault it is they ca n't read, invariably they will say it's their fault,'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> says. `` They blame themselves. But there are always extenuating circumstances they ca n't control. Someone else's fault: a teacher, a parent, a school system. They drop behind and then get caught in the cycle.'' In recent years, the federal and local governments, local school systems, libraries, churches, businesses and community groups have entered the endeavor, starting up programs at various levels to assist people in learning how to read. `` There's no indication the problem is getting any worse,'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> says. `` However, it does n't appear to be getting any better.''

 Huge carved stone heads, tiny clay figures and thousands of other artifacts at a museum here tell a strange story about three civilizations that flourished long before <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> discovered <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's about the <ORGANIZATION> Olmecs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Totonacas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huaxtecs </PERSON>, who inhabited a long stretch of coast on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The fascinating and sometimes gruesome story is told vividly at the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xalapa </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in the region's archaeological treasures A lot is still unknown about the three civilizations. They are believed to have been part of a series of migrations from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> that started about 35,000 years ago across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, by way of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and lasted several millenia. But, says museum director <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitaine </PERSON>, `` as new finds are made and studies of old ones shed new light, the results may rewrite quite a few history books. `` We do n't know what their language was, or what they even called themselves,'' he adds. `` Even the names we use for them are false and relatively new. They are ` nahuatl' names, the trading language of the <ORGANIZATION> Aztecs </ORGANIZATION>, which did n't even exist at the time.'' Only 3,000 of the museum's 29,000 pieces are on display for lack of space. They tell how these people performed human sacrifices, probably perceived the earth as round, designed remarkably accurate calendars and had an advanced knowledge of mathemathics and astronomy, among other things. The artifacts range in size from a tiny Olmec carving of a rain god 4 inches high, to huge stone altars. The museum's centerpiece is a monolithic head 9 feet high and weighing 16 tons, carved from andesite rock. Now housed in a new $ 3 million set of modern buildings covering 14,400 square yards and surrounded by eight acres of wooded park, the museum is part of the <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state university in <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>, the state's capital 74 miles northwest of the port of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>. The Olmecs, Totonacas and Huaxtecas based their agriculture on corn, frijole beans and squash, supplementing their diets with dog meat, river fish and wild animals and birds, which they seasoned with chili peppers, herbs and other spices. Both their weapons and their tools were crude, mostly made out of stone or wood, and no one is sure how they carved such huge stone statues. But their civilizations were surprisingly advanced for its time. In his guidebook `` Master Works of the <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>,'' Mexican anthropolgist <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Medellin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zenil </PERSON> says it's possible the <ORGANIZATION> Olmecs </ORGANIZATION> were the first to make paper out of wood pulp in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Archaeologists believe the political organization was more of a loose coalition of small towns or city-states than one big government entity. But their influence spread far and wide and some of it survives in present-day <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They could read and write and knew what a wheel was, but did n't use it, probably because they had no draft animals Their ancestors had hunted them all out of existence, including the ancient American horse and the elephant. They spun and wove fibers, including cotton. They tailored their clothes, wore earrings and jewelry, blackened their teeth with natural tar for cosmetic purposes and made rubber from the rubber tree, which is native to the region. Being cross-eyed was considered a sign of beauty. By polishing metallic rock, the <ORGANIZATION> Olmecs </ORGANIZATION> made flat mirrors which they hung over their chests as jewelry, or concave ones, which they used to light fires. They made music on drums, whistles, ocarinas, clay flutes and other instruments. They traveled and traded extensively, as far west as the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and as far south as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, spreading their cultures and acquiring new ones. As a result, cacao _ the bean from which chocolate is derived and is native to the Gulf Coast _ became a popular currency for trade throughout pre-Columbian <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At first, they cremated or simply buried their dead, but later they built little pyramidal rock mounds to mark the sites. Later still, they built the monumental pyramids that survive today. They played a ceremonial sport with a rubber ball, which was a combination of soccer and basketball. The winning team was afterwards beheaded as a sacrifice, usually to a sun god, although some authorities claim it was the losers who lost their heads. Other victims had their hearts cut out atop some pyramid or other sacred altar. Some were skinned alive and priests donned their skins to dance before <PERSON> Xipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Totec </PERSON>, the `` god of the flayed,'' in a fertility rite to mark the beginning of spring. Prisoners of war often had their hands severed so the victors could acquire their strength, skill and magic. Worship was centered on the sun, the moon and the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. All three cultures worshipped the jaguar as a sun god and hunting the animal was forbidden, except for its skins, which priests wore during sacred ceremonies. The jaguar was often depicted in partly human form. It was said that in times long past a woman mated with a jaguar, giving birth to a `` were-jaguar.'' Archeologists believe this explains the <ORGANIZATION> Olmecs </ORGANIZATION>' morbid fascination with dwarfs, hunchbacks and other human deformations. Little is known about <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, usually depicted as the lesser of the three, except that <PERSON> Ehecatl </PERSON> <PERSON> Quetzalcoatl </PERSON>, god of the hurricane and other winds, and <PERSON> Xochiquetzal </PERSON>, goddess of love and the spring, were probably associated with it. The most fascinating of the moon deities was Tlasolteotl, the <LOCATION> Totonaca </LOCATION> goddess of confession, protectress of childbirth and advocate of illicit love and passions. She encouraged people to sin so that she could later absolve them. Sinners had to confess to her, so that she could devour the `` rubbish or spiritual garbage'' that weighed upon them. `` But,'' says <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>, `` only one confession was allowed in a lifetime, and people tried to put it off as much as they could, since there was no forgiveness for a second offender.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are on the radical fringe of the environmental movement, labeled terrorists by some for their practice of `` monkeywrenching,'' sabotaging the equipment of loggers and developers. But Earth First! founder <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> compares his style of civil disobedience with that of <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> or Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 From their seats in a <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> conference hall, some 400 people tip their noses toward the rafters and let out a long, high-pitched howl. With scarcely a giggle, they howl their scorn at wilderness-wrecking development, howl their devotion to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s controversial brand of environmentalism. Wolf mimicry is among the more benign of <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s attention-grabbing tricks, which some call criminal, others call visionary It's the stuff of Earth First!, the self-styled radical fringe of environmentalism founded by <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> in 1980 when he decided the movement was boring itself out of existence. Since then, Earth Firsters have been putting themselves on front pages, infuriating loggers and frustrating law enforcement officials with their `` civil disobedience'' protests. They shackle themselves to trees, stage sit-ins before bulldozer blades, pour sand in the engines of earthmovers and pound spikes in tree trunks to mangle loggers' saws. They call the practice monkeywrenching. In the eyes of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> and his followers are `` terrorists.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> prefers to compare himself to <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He says sabotaging equipment is n't terrorism because it does n't hurt people `` I think that I believe in non-violence, too,'' he says. `` Pulling up survey stakes, putting sand in the crank case of a bulldozer, those are n't violent.'' Though opponents often link Earth First! to an accident in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in which a sawmill worker was hurt by a tree spike that struck a saw blade, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says conservationists were not involved. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who makes his home in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, has been arrested several times. Dozens of Earth First! members were charged with criminal mischief and similar crimes for anti-logging protests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> last summer. Over the past few years they've blockaded oil wells, occupied uranium mines and joined <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> at nuclear test protests in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. If people see him going to jail for his cause, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says, maybe they'll take environmentalism more seriously. `` Sometimes you've got to put your body on the line,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says. `` Face it. There are a lot of madmen and madwomen out there destroying the earth. Why should n't we be mad about it? Why should n't we be passionate? `` We need to scare people. It's not our job to come up with the final, politically acceptable solution. We're advocates.'' For all its radical tone, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s activism has its underpinnings in conventional political strategy. At a how-to workshop on promoting the environmental cause, he explained he does n't really expect the general public to adopt all his views. By presenting an extreme, he simply hopes to shift the ultimate compromise his way. `` There are rational solutions, but others should find them,'' he said. `` I see very few politicians respond to facts. I see politicians respond to votes, to public opinion. We compromise and we sort of water down our opinions before ever speaking them.'' He tells a class how to use self-deprecating jokes _ as politicians do _ to make the audience think they're regular guys. He advises his students not to dread a knowledgeable audience. `` If you relax, you can sound like you know a lot more about something than you do.'' Passing out pamphlets? Dress up in animal costumes and stage a skit, he says. You'll be harder to ignore. And when you're really in an adversarial position, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says, remember `` They ca n't beat you up quite as much if they're laughing. It was <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s talent for humor and drama that brought him an invitation to speak at the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s recent conference in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. The assembly got the theater it wanted as he sermonized. First came the doomsday predictions: `` 1988 is the greatest biological crisis since evolution began 3 -LCB- billion years ago,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says. `` By the year 2,000 the only large mammals left will be the ones we allow to exist.'' Then the promise of salvation: This generation is the most important that ever lived, he says, the generation that can halt environmental destruction. Then the underlying moral: Biocentrism, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says, is the most important philosophy of man. It holds that you ca n't change one part of the world without affecting every other, that a crab in the mud has as much right to life as a man. And, finally, the call to give up worldly goods, to choose wilderness over drinking more <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, buying more VCRs, figuring the value of something `` by how many greasy bills you can pile up next to it.'' Forget about building more highways and bring back the bison instead, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says. Look beneath skyscrapers and opera houses to see `` a vision of the world the way it could be.'' Be an animal, he advises, closing with the howl, 400 voices strong. So how does <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> suggest modernized Americans get back to the bison? `` I do n't have all the answers,'' he says after the speech. `` I think that's one of the problems, that we think we have to have all the answers. But I want to energize people to ask the questions.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> says giving up all modern ways for an ecologically sound Stone Age is not the idea. He'd settle for a shift toward the primitive side. `` I believe in compromise and balance. We're protecting something like 3 percent of the land of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as wilderness. I do n't think that's balance. I would be satisfied with 20 or 30 percent.'' The conservationists who work to reach those compromises sometimes seem unsure how to react to <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s flamboyance. Some <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> environmentalists were titillated. `` Did you know you're sitting behind a terrorist?'' one lobbyist stage-whispered a row behind <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who was giggling at the furor his visit had stirred. Loggers and state Natural Resources Commissioner <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> boycotted the meeting because of <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s presence. Others mixed admiration with a tinge of embarrassment. <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, was <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s partner in founding Earth First!, but returned to more conventional environmental groups in 1982. Though they've been best friends since 1973 and remain so, <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> does n't like to be reminded of his ties to <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> is n't offended. Being environmentalism's bad boy, he says, has its political purpose. `` I think we help other environmental groups look mainstream and reasonable _ which they are _ but I think we've helped move them toward taking a stronger position,'' he says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Many of the stories of the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> have become the plot lines for movies, but sometimes the author's artistry has been lost in the translation Now his sons and some of their friends have formed a movie company to try to faithfully adapt their father's works to feature films.

 A realist in the video age, writer <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> believes that film offers him the best opportunity to carry on in his famous father's footsteps. The son of the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known writers, is one of the founders of a new movie company dedicated to faithfully adapating the works of famous authors, starting with <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>. Sitting in the secluded <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> studio of artist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON>, his film company partner, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> explains his plans for <ORGANIZATION> Steinbeck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Our concern is with craftsmanship. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> spent a lot of time on his work,'' says <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, who frequently refers to his father by the family name. `` We're going to spend as much time on his work as he did.'' With dark, combed-back hair, ruddy complexion and piercing blue eyes, the 43-year-old <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> resembles the prize-winning author who wrote `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' `` East of Eden'' and other classics of American literature. Following years of struggle to make a living as an author, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> gained national attention in the early 1930s as a writer who could masterfully depict the plight of the disenfranchised and downtrodden. He produced 19 works of fiction, eight of non-fiction and also plays, a documentary and a screenplay. His 1939 book `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' about the hopeless migration of Dust Bowl farmers, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also was one of the many <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> stories adapted for film. In 1962, six years before his death at age 66, <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s two sons, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, are writers themselves and now partners in the film venture. `` We chose <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> to work with first because there've been very few accurate interpretations of his work that have been translated into film,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> says. `` In many cases, companies have chosen pieces that are far too long for a 125-page script, which is usually standard.'' The results, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> says, have been films which cut the writing of his father and others to fit the filmmaking `` formula.'' `` On Broadway, the author owns the stage. In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, he's lucky if he can get invited to a couple of parties,'' says <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, who recently completed the screenplay of his father's novel, `` In Dubious Battle'' for a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> film company, <ORGANIZATION> Zupnick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> It's not that the senior <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> minded seeing his writing adapted for film. `` <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> is not like a lot of authors,'' <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON> says, `` because he thought visually and wrote visually. Some writers are totally verbal. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> is easy to intepret to film because he saw it that way. He loved movies. All his best friends were involved in movies.'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> says his father knew and influenced the writers who adapted his stories for film while he was alive. `` It's the films that have taken place since his death that I think he would roll over in his grave about,'' he says. The company plans to make full-length feature films based on `` Travels With <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> in Search of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s last book, and `` The Moon Is Down,'' a story about <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation of a Norwegian town in World War II. Short stories from `` The Long Valley'' and `` The Pastures of Heaven'' are also slated for production, with `` The Long Valley'' scheduled for release in about a year. `` We want to stay very close to the novel,'' <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON> says, `` so that eventually what people can have is a videotape library of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s work.'' If translating books to film is so difficult, then why not leave <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s efforts in their purest form? `` Because people do n't read any more,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> says with a laugh. `` And the only way I can start them to read is by doing accurate interpretations of <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s work so that they might be enticed to read it.'' Some of <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s work that is already on film should n't be duplicated, <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> says. `` Who could play <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Joad </PERSON> better than <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said of actor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> who starred in `` The Grapes of Wrath.'' For the last 2 -LCB- years, the <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> brothers and <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON> have talked of starting a film company. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> spent last summer and fall in a cabin near <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON>'s mountain home and the wheels began to turn. Three other partners, whom <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> did n't want to identify, are also involved. The firm will have offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> makes his home and where his father lived off and on. <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has continued to print <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> books in hardbound and paperback editions. The largest printings since 1986 have been 280,000 paperback copies of `` The Grapes of Wrath'' and 119,500 of `` East of Eden.'' Professor <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steinbeck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, believes there is an ample market worldwide for the films. `` Whenever somebody makes a film out of <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> literature, I want to see it,'' <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> says, though he concedes that some people have been disappointed in the past when <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> stories were adapted for film. `` ` Cannery Row'' independently was a very enjoyable movie, but if you're serious about comparing movies and literary work, a lot of scholars were disappointed,'' <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> says. `` Film is a very independent art after all.'' The logo of the film company is a haunting sketch of the elder <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, done by <PERSON> Gregan </PERSON>. But what would <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> say in response to critics who might accuse him of trying to profit off of his father's name? `` I make money off my father's name right now,'' he said in a blunt, matter-of-fact tone. `` My name is <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>. I also share in the literary estate with my brother and stepmother. `` It's a little bit like inheriting a grocery store. You've got one of two choices: letting the fruit rot on the shelves and not pay attention to it or you can see it as an ongoing business. Certainly a literary estate is an ongoing business.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON>, who has become known as one of the world's most exciting young conductors, is introducing his <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> to American audiences for the first time. The orchestra, which Rattle believes is `` well on the way'' to becoming <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s finest, will tour 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities from March 29 to April 17. Rattle has made his mark in the music world without joining the baton-wielding jet set or accepting a top job with a prestigious orchestra. In fact, he regularly turns down offers to appear as guest conductor. The 33-year-old native of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, prefers to concentrate on his job as conductor of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> orchestra and his work as principal guest of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. The curly haired, bright-eyed <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> took over the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> orchestra in 1980, at age 25. He plans to stay a while, already making plans for the orchestra into the next century. Before he went to <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> was the No. 2 conductor with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> and did a lot of guest conducting. `` In some ways,'' he says, `` I was following a more conventional career pattern than I seem to be now.'' Rattle is not without his fans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the words of critic <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> is considered a first-rate conductor who `` inspires players and elates audiences.'' Just before Rattle conducted the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> in his 1985 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut, critic <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` The biggest surprise about this debut by the most brilliantly successful conductor of the younger generation in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ the perception, power and clarity of whose work has been acclaimed internationally _ is not the age at which it is occurring but the fact that it did not happen long ago. Mr. Rattle has been invited to the Metropolitan Opera and he has been invited to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. He has turned both down.'' During a recent stopover in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> was asked if an offer from a prestigious orchestra would lure him away from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` I've been given enough offers that have n't,'' he answers, declining to elaborate. It is known that in 1984 he rejected an invitation from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> to become its music director. `` The work in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> is so satisfying,'' he says. `` And it is also unfinished. Now we're planning a festival. Starting in 1991, we'll do spring festivals, each year concentrating on the music of one decade of 20th century music. `` In 2000 we'll just about have caught up with ourselves. In 1999, when we're dealing with the music of the'90s, we will surely be playing music by people who now are schoolchildren.'' <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> said in 1985 that he thought the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> Symphony could become the best in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I think they're well on the way,'' he says now. `` My wife tells me I always refer to the City of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> as ` us,' which is true,'' he says. `` We consider that we've been able to grow together. They play beautifully as a unit. There's a degree of listening to each other as an ensemble, like chamber music playing, that is unique in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' Though he has made a lot of music documentaries for television, surveying trends or about a particular composer's work, <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> says he is n't a TV `` natural'' like <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>. `` Andre created an extraordinary new audience in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for music. He can talk to the camera as though it was his best friend. It's something I admire enormously. I ca n't do that.'' Rattle's father briefly led a jazz band. While he appreciates jazz, the younger <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> knew from the time he entered the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> at age 16 that he would conduct. He thought he'd have to be an instrumentalist _ he was a percussionist _ first, whose conducting career would only be beginning `` about now. Conducting happened sooner because <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> won a conetst. `` I went in simply because if you got in the final 10, there was a chance to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Bournemouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says. `` I was 19 and I'd never conducted a professional orchestra. `` I still think I only won because it never occurred to me that I might win and I had no anxiety. The final piece I conducted was <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' ` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>,' which takes 17 minutes. There were 20 minutes to rehearse it. At that age, it was probably just as well. I did n't have time to get up the noses of the musicians. Studying conducting, <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON> says, he learned that `` there's as much connection with what your baton does to the orchestra as to what a violinist's bow does to the strings. All motions a conductor makes affect the orchestra, even if you do n't want them to. `` The reason a conductor begins to get halfway competent around 50 or 60 is that he probably has had as much time in front of an orchestra then as the average 20-year-old violinist has had playing his instrument. `` At a certain point, to be able to communicate what you know, you have to know your musicians. That's the reason I went down the road of working very hard with one orchestra.'' One of the reasons Rattle limits his guest conducting is that he and his American wife, soprano <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, and 4-year-old son <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>, like to spend time together. `` I'm not one of those musicians who wants to live a life which is entirely the musician part,'' he says. `` I'd like to be able to explore the richness of life. There is enough else going on in the world to put music in perspective.''

 When the time came for President <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s secretary of war to point out Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s route into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, he had to seek help from a private `` We were filming a scene and we could n't find the place on the map,'' says <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>, who portrays <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>.'' `` The only person who knew the route was a private.'' The private was one of the Civil War re-enactors who served as Union and Confederate soldiers for the four-hour adaptation of <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s book about life inside the White House. ` They were just an enormous resource in helping the rest of us, who were just pretending, to feel authentic,'' says <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>. `` I remember riding down a street and there were small groups of Union soldiers along the way. They came to attention as I passed. They did it according to Civil War drill. `` They were immensely supportive of the rest of us. They saved us more than once when we needed information, like with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s route. `` Lincoln,'' which will be televised on Sunday and Monday, also stars <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> as Gen. <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> as Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, who hopes to become president, and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> as <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s overly ambitious daughter, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>. In an ironic twist on history, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scenes were filmed in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the capital of the Confederacy. The Confederate Home for Needy Women, built as a replica of the original <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was used as the executive mansion. <PERSON> Petersburg </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> put up his last defense before surrendering at <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION>, was also used for some <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> scenes. `` The side benefit of that was that everyone had an enormous interest in the Civil War,'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says. `` One man came up to me and said, ` If you were the man you're pretending to be I'd want to shoot you.' We got into quite a discussion.'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says he had not seen any <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> portrayals in a long time and had purposely avoided looking at any. `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> seems to me to be the closest to what I imagine he was really like,'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> appeared in `` Young Mr. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'' in 1939. `` But I did n't see anything. The danger is that you'll be influenced. In college a friend was doing ` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>' and made the fatal mistake of seeing <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s film about five days before we opened He could n't put it out of his head.'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says he read a lot of books on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, including one by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Safire </PERSON>, one-time speech writer for President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Safire </PERSON> meddles with the facts, he tells you how,'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says. `` If he's interpreting, he tells you the opposing views so you do n't have to read 17 different books to get all the viewpoints.'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> says when he read <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s book he thought it would make good television. `` It's the Civil War as seen from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which is different from the usual way of looking in from the outside. It shows how <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> responded to the pressure of events. I think what's most extraordinary was that he was not perfectly attuned to every situation. `` But when the chips were down he was up to the occasion. That's what people have found remarkable about him _ how could a man of his background find the skills to manage a war on a scale that no one had ever imagined His law partner once described him as a man who read less and thought more than anyone he had ever known.'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> also spent time trying to understand the man. `` <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> called him ` the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> gorilla,''' he says. `` It certainly takes a breadth of mind to hire that same man as your secretary of war.'' <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>, who is somewhat Lincolnesque in build and looks, says he has wanted to portray <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for a long time. `` There ought to be some reward for looking like this,'' he says. `` I thought he was a fascinating man. You ca n't help but be in awe of this combination of high principle and amazing public skills.'' It was <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>'s third opportunity to work with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. Previously, they were in `` Finnegan Begin Again'' and `` Just Between Friends.'' He says he found her portrayal of Mrs. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> as a woman on the edge `` very bold and interesting.'' <PERSON> Waterson </PERSON> is currently starring with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> play `` A Walk in the Woods.'' Playwright <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON> based it on a real incident in which two arms negotiators, one American and one Soviet, worked out a deal during a walk in the woods in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. This is one of the rare TV appearances for <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Academy Award for `` The Killing Fields,'' although he did star in a series six years ago, `` Q.E.D.''

 <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> put her own money, some $ 850,000, where her convictions were and brought `` Fences'' to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards, a Pulitzer Prize and a lucrative film sale were her reward. Smart money was against the play, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>' first solo producing venture. `` Listen kid, it ai n't commercial,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> deadpans, mimicking the advice she got from seasoned theater professionals. They cautioned against bringing to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the August <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> drama about the upheavals of a black family during the late 1950s. `` It was important for me to do ` Fences' because I believed in it,'' the producer said the other day, between coos to her infant son, <PERSON> Wally </PERSON>, in a Fifth Avenue hotel suite. `` It was very important for me to send out the word to young emerging American playwrights that Broadway is a place where their dreams could be fulfilled. You do n't have to go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.'' Besides `` Fences,'' <PERSON> Wally </PERSON>, born Aug. 16, was <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>' other big production last year. When <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, wearing a maternity evening gown, clambered to the stage of the Mark Hellinger Theater last June to accept a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> as producer of the best play of the season, she exclaimed, `` I think I'm going to give birth right now.'' She did n't. Little <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> actually arrived some two months later, but, according to <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, `` He knows ` Fences' inside and out.'' The baby made his Broadway stage debut _ at age 8 weeks _ in the show. Wrapped in a blanket, he was carried on stage by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who usually cradles a doll. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> had to be kept covered, though. He was playing a little black girl. `` I do n't believe I did that,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> laughs. `` I'm a real stage mother.'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> first saw `` Fences'' in January 1986 at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Goodman Theater, while it was making the circuit of various regional theaters. By intermission, she knew she wanted to produce the play. She met with director <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who had first done the show at the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repertory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with author <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` It was all very simple,'' she recalls. `` I said, ` I want to do this. It will be done. I have a theater in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.''' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> actually runs three theaters there _ the <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, the Golden Gate and the Orpheum _ all owned by her family. Her father is <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate mogul. Three years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> estimated the family fortune at some $ 300 million. <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> always was stage-struck. Theater-going was the big family activity. She remembers as a child putting on her party dress and white gloves and going to the theater. When her family got into theater real estate, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> got into the theater business. `` I started at the bottom of the top,'' she recalls, learning what it takes to put on a play. Until `` Fences,'' though, she had never produced a show on her own. `` I think the easiest thing is to find other investors,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> says. `` You can twist arms. I always sold the most Camp Fire Girl cookies and Girl Scout cookies. `` That's the point of my being ` Fence's' sole investor. It was about doing it right and having that control. I think when you produce you must be a benevolent dictator. You must have the power to make a decision, to say ` no' or ` yes.''' Before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> staged `` Fences'' at one of her theaters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and the reviews were mixed. Changes needed to be made, particularly in clarifying the play's final scene, and <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> saw that they were. `` It was a tryout and we went through the process of trying different things,'' she recalls. `` Ultimately, it worked, but it could have gone the other way.'' Now the future of `` Fences'' seems secure. The play, now starring <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, has started its second year at Broadway's 46th Street Theater. Its fortunes were boosted last April after the drama won the Pulitzer Prize, last June when it won four <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards and then later in the year when <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> paid some $ 500,000 for the film rights as a possible vehicle for the super hot <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` I never did the play strictly as a commercial venture,'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> says. `` I'm a Broadway baby. I believe in Broadway as being the pinnacle of American theater. `` The first day of rehearsals for ` Fences' I said to everyone, ` We do not know what's going to happen to this play, but we know that we will all do our very, very best,''' she recalls. `` ` And I want all of you to know that as a producer, you have my word that this show is n't going to open and close. No matter what. We're going to try and keep it running.' So far, <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> has n't had any trouble keeping her promise.

<HEAD>November 1985 Key in Relationship Between U.S., Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tangled, complicated and close relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is underscored by developments in the Iran-Contra affair and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline deal, which converged in November 1985. By coincidence, that mont also saw a serious rift in U.S.-Israeli relations when <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a counterterrorism expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was arrested as a spy for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An examination of what led up to the events of November 1985 provides insight into the relationship between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the interaction between officials from the two countries. Two independent counsels, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, are investigating the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pipeline proposal and the Iran-Contra affair, respectively. They have begun to share information in a search for links between the cases. What is clear is that at least two of the same people dealt with both cases; private citizens used their friendships with government officials to make money, and international policy was affected by business interests. At the same time that Israelis were shipping U.S.-made weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, businessmen were enlisting friends at the highest levels of both governments to guarantee the safety of a proposed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> oil pipeline from Israeli bombing attacks. Late in the year, the Israelis gave <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> free rein over $ 850,000 in excess profit from the Iranian arms sales. Most of that money went to the Nicaraguan Contras, according to a congressional report. Here is a loose chronology: On November 21, 1985, <PERSON> North </PERSON> worked frantically in his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> office to sort out foul-ups in the plan to have <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ship 80 Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as part of a deal to release six American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Desperate for help, he called his boss, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then national security adviser, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The Israelis had flown the first batch of U.S.-made weapons to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in late August, leading to freedom for hostage <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> in September. Details for future shipments were ironed out by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prime minister. Handling operational details on the Israeli side was <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwimmer </PERSON>, an arms dealer, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and one of <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' closest friends. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given his blessing to the project. On Nov. 22, an Iranian middleman transferred $ 24 million _ payment for 80 <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> _ into Swiss bank accounts controlled by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intermediary. North had ordered <PERSON> Schwimmer </PERSON> to place $ 1 million in a Lake Resources account run by private businessmen working with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The money was to cover transportation costs of flying the missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Ultimately, only 18 of the 80 Hawks were flown to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Nov. 24. Shipments were halted because the Iranians complained they had been cheated on the kind of missiles sent to them; no hostages were released. Because only 18 Hawks were delivered, more than $ 800,000 remained in bank accounts under <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s supervision. That money was spent on the Nicaraguan Contras _ the first diversion of money to the rebels, and it appears to derive from Israeli funds, a congressional report on the Iran-Contra affair says. `` North testified that in early 1986 he told the Israelis that the money had been used ` for the purpose of the Contras' and they acquiesced,'' the report said. The Israelis said <PERSON> North </PERSON> told them Dec. 6, 1985, that he intended to use proceeds from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to help the Contras. American investigators have been unable to question <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials face-to-face about the Iran-Contra case. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy, did not return telephone calls asking about the diversion. The Israelis gave the congressional Iran-Contra committees written chronologies, but no one was interviewed in person. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has not been able to question Israelis, either. About the time the missiles were en route to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, another project that involved <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came to a boil: the proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> to build a $ 1 billion, 540-mile pipeline to run from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oil fields to the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>. The route ran near the Israeli border. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, who has a relationship with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that goes back 45 years, had hired as his attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscan </LOCATION> with close ties to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. On Sept. 19, 1985, four days after hostage <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> was freed, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> asking the attorney general to advise Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest in the pipeline. Promoters of the project planned to pay <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to keep <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from bombing the pipeline in the territory of its enemy, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A week later, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s purported arrangement to pay <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The debt apparently involved <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s role in freeing <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, the memo said. <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> `` indicates that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> emphatically indicated that the release of <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> was a result of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and no one else,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote. In his memo, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says `` there is a feeling that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ` owes' and that the accomplishment of this project, as outlined in my memo, is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has denied he or his party received bribes; he has called the idea `` nonsense.'' The Israeli government supported the project, however, he said. On Oct. 7, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> discuss the pipeline with <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> who is `` thoroughly familiar with the subject.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had assigned <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON> to quarterback <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the pipeline. When <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Oct. 16-Oct. 12, he met with <PERSON> McFarlene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wigg </PERSON> about the pipeline, according to sources quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> On Nov. 20, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> sent <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> a letter saying the Israeli government was prepared to `` extend guarantees'' that the pipeline would not be touched. Within weeks, a proposal surfaced which called for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to make secret payments to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to prevent a pipeline bombing. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, eventually ended the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> involvement in the pipeline at year's end. It was never built. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> continues to investigate the unrelated <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledeen </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> consultant, said he thinks the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> case may have encouraged red-faced Israelis to keep pushing the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative on the assumption it would lead to release of more American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, thus pleasing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An Israeli source with access to top officials in his government says <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> indicated that <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> thought it could earn forgiveness for the <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> affair if hostages were freed. The source spoke on condition he remain anonymous. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> publicly apologized to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Dec. 1, 1985. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges he sold secret military documents to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>, was sentenced to five years for being an accessory. Israeli Air Force Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aviem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sella </PERSON> was indicted, and three other Israelis were named as co-conspirators in the espionage network operating inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Au Revoir Les Enfants,'' ``The Family''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Hollywood's pursuit of the here-and-now has created a glossy, mostly superficial quality to the product coming out of the major studios. Nowadays it's European filmmakers who indulge in remembrance of things past. Two commendable examples are candidates for this year's Academy Award as best foreign language film: `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>'' from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and `` The Family'' from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>, after working for a decade in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, returned to his homeland for the most personal film in his distinguished career, `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>'' -LRB- `` Goodbye, Children'' -RRB-. He wrote and directed the film from his own bitter memories as a schoolboy in occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II. The story begins with a tearful 12-year-old, <PERSON> Julien </PERSON> <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON>, leaving his mother in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to attend a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> boys school in <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION>. There he encounters the taunts of the older boys, the privations of wartime and the strict discipline of the priests. <PERSON> Julien </PERSON> forms a grudging friendship with a bright, aloof fellow student, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON>, whose background is a mystery. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, it turns out, is a Jew whose identity is hidden by the sympathetic priests. But <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> is betrayed by someone inside the school, and both he, two other boys and the head priest are taken off to concentration camps. A brief synopsis can not convey the rich texture <PERSON> Malle </PERSON> contributes to the melancholy tale, nor the deep humanity. He is fortunate in his choice of two gifted young performers: <PERSON> Gaspard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manesse </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Julien </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fejto </PERSON> -LRB- Jean -RRB-. In `` The Family,'' <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> Scola </PERSON> traces the 80-year history of a Roman family through the recollections of the central figure, <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>. The entire film takes place within the family's apartment, with views of the hallway signifying the change of eras. The turbulent events from 1906 to 1986 provide the backdrop for the family history. The central theme is <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>'s divided affection between the sister he marries and the sister he really loves. <PERSON> Scola </PERSON> is the master of such wide-sweeping stories, and his depiction of the temperament and humor of the Italians is delightful. He chose three actors to depict <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> at different ages: young <PERSON> Emmanuele </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamaro </PERSON>, the rising star <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhipinto </PERSON> as <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> from 20 to 40, and <PERSON> Vittorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassman </PERSON> thereafter. All three are superb. `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>,'' an Orion Classics release, is rated PG and runs 103 minutes. In French with English subtitles. `` The Family'' is a <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release, rated PG, running time: 127 minutes. In Italian with English subtitles.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Poitier Is Back to the Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> was recently asked why he took a 10-year absence from film acting. In explaining why, in a roundabout way, he reminisced warmly about his boyhood on <LOCATION> Cat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>: `` I started work when I was seven. My father was a tomato farmer, and I was the youngest of the -LRB- family -RRB- group. It was not traditional to leave a child of seven, because a child of seven was able to work. There was no one to leave me with. So I went to the fields, for the practical value of contributing to the family by working. `` I remember we took our breakfast at home, and then we walked to the fields, which were three to four miles from the house. We would all walk because there was no form of transportation except for the donkey, which my mother would ride. It was a very important time when I would be allowed to ride the donkey for brief periods. `` We worked in the fields until the sun was mid-sky. About that time, my mother would quit work, build a wood fire, take utensils out of a bag, and she would cook for the family in the fields. We used leaves of plants for plates. Interesting. We did n't know what we were doing, but they were biodegradable. `` My job was to find the leaves, which were usually what we call a sea grape in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. My mother would fashion them into a plate, very easily done. Of course we did n't have knives and forks, so we would twist one of these leaves into a spoon. After lunch we worked until the light began to fade, then we would go back to the house, where my mother would have to prepare a fire and cook dinner.'' The <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> farm went bust when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banned tomato imports from the islands, and the family moved to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>. A husky lad, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> at 12 -LCB- became a ditch digger and water boy for a construction project. `` And I've been working ever since,'' he declared. This, he admitted with a laugh, was a long way around to answering the question. But then, <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> has always been a man to choose his words with thoughtful care, never flinging pat answers to oft-asked questions. When he reached 50, he continued, he faced the situation of many people in mid-life: `` You somehow develop through the years work habits. More than that, one becomes psychologically habituated to the process of work as the gauge for your life. We work and we take a certain amount of time off every year _ two weeks or three or four if we're fortunate The rest of the time we're doing the nine-to-five. Even if you have the awareness of other lifestyles, you do n't have the wherewithal to investigate them. `` At 50 I decided to see what life was really like outside of the narrow corridor of work.'' What is it like? `` It's wonderful,'' he said. `` It's a little scary, because most of the wonderful things have nothing to do with making a buck. The world is filled with wonderful things; a remarkable diversity exists in the world.'' <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON>, who is now 61, fulfilled a long-held desire to study astronomy. He began work on a novel. He and his wife, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimkus </PERSON>, and their two daughters -LRB- he has four grown daughters as well -RRB- traveled a great deal. He also looked into individuals and organizations who in a quiet sort of way _ <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> style _ try to improve the world around them. He stopped acting after `` A Piece of the Action'' in 1977, but not filmmaking. He directed `` Stir Crazy,'' `` Hanky Panky'' and `` Fast Forward.'' About 18 months ago, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Puttnam </PERSON>, then head of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, sent <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> a script about an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> man who enlists an 18-year-old to catch a pair of Soviet spies _ the boy's own parents. The result: `` Little Nikita,'' starring <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> and <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Then <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> submitted `` Shoot to Kill,'' with <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent chasing a killer through the wilds. The film was released before `` Little Nikita'' and has reasserted the star's box-office power. It may seem a curious coincidence that <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> would play <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> men in his two returning films, but he maintains it's not surprising. `` That seems to be a trend in motion pictures. Many of our top actors, and I do n't place myself among them, play law enforcement officers. -LRB- <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>. -LRB- Sylvester -RRB- <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. -LRB- Al -RRB- <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>. Why? `` I have a feeling that filmmaking is so much a business that we tend to search for formulas more than we are willing to admit. Cops are almost always good guys, however one-dimensional they are drawn. Criminals are the bad guys. So we do n't have to deal with real issues. We can deal with surface entertainment and a lot of razzle-dazzle, action, dangerous activity and gunplay.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Animal Fat and Felt Do Sculpture Make</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH JAUTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s answer to the late pop artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, once said the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall should be raised 10 centimeters for aesthetic reasons. The comment did little to endear him to his countrymen. For most of his career, <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> was better known in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than at home. But now, two years after his death, Germans have suddenly become fans of the avant-garde artist. Prices for his works are skyrocketing. Critics are singing his praises. And record numbers of visitors are flocking to see the first-ever major exhibition of his sketches and sculptures in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at one of the nation's leading museums. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a smaller exhibit of <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON>' early drawings also is attracting crowds to the communist capital. The overhaul of <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON>' reputation has been speedy. Less than a year ago, cleaners at the <ORGANIZATION> Duesseldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> accidentally threw out a Beuys sculpture made of wood, butter and animal fat. The cleaners thought the creation was, literally, garbage. `` I often wonder what <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> himself would think of all this,'' said a bemused <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON>, who served as the artist's assistant for 12 years. `` He was used to criticizing society, but not to being toasted by it.'' <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> specialized in sculptures made out of everyday items or cast-off objects: empty boxes and tin cans, scraps of wood, stones, shoes, blackboards or pieces of furniture. Felt and fat were his favorite materials. In one creation, a single egg sits atop a wooden bench. In another, a pair of battered boots dangles on a string above two empty crates. A 1977 sculpture entitled `` In Memory of My Youth in the Mountains'' consists of three large, white boulders inscribed with the same words of the title. `` <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> believed art had to be puzzling to be good, and there is no denying that he is puzzling,'' said <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON>, who organized the 120-piece exhibition in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Gropius-Bau </ORGANIZATION> museum. The 10-week show, which opened Feb. 20, drew an unexpected 9,000 visitors in its first five days, an unofficial record for an exhibit in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. With his jaunty and battered felt hat, vest and rumpled trenchcoat, <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> never looked like he fit in among the prosperous and serious West Germans. His sense of humor was also atypically German. He was fired from his job as administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> Duesseldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in 1972, after announcing he would hire only applicants who had failed a formal art program. He was dismissed by an angry <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON>, then the economics minister for the state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON>' birthplace and lifelong home. But <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> and other politicians have since changed their tune. Now the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhine-Westphalian </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Rau </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last month to open the city's first <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> exhibition and lavish praise on his former employee. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s culture chief, claimed <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> for Berliners. `` It is only fitting that the best-known contemporary German artist be shown first in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON> told reporters at the Bueys exhibit's gala opening. <PERSON> Bastian </PERSON> is at a loss to explain the boost in Bueys' popularity, and says it caught him by surprise. `` Throughout the history of art, there have been artists who have become popular only after their deaths,'' he said. `` That has been particularly true for modern art. No one can say why this is so.'' In a recent issue of <LOCATION> Der </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest news weekly, the entire letters column was devoted to <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON>. Opinion was running decidedly against the artist. `` You recently ran pictures of <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> works,'' wrote <PERSON> Immo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayser-Eichberg </PERSON>, a lawyer from the town of <LOCATION> Meerbusch </LOCATION>. `` You do not seriously consider these things works of art, do you?'' Visitors to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beuys </LOCATION> exhibition were more tactful. `` No I do not understand it,'' said <PERSON> Ulrike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>, gazing at a <PERSON> Beuys </PERSON> object that appeared to be little more than several empty blackboards scattered on the floor. `` But that does not mean I do not automatically dislike it.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: `Miami Vice' Music Man Drops Crockett, Tubbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> had one thing in common with the cocaine dealers on `` Miami Vice'': he was fleeing <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON>. Unlike those villains, the man behind the `` Vice'' music got away. After three years of scoring the show, Hammer has stepped down from handling the weekly music chores for `` Miami Vice.'' And he's released a new album, aptly titled `` Escape From Television. `` It was very autobiographical when the name was coined,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said recently in an interview at his manager's <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office. `` We went through many different titles, and then I came up with ` Escape From Television,' because I was definitely leaving the show.'' The decision to leave, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said, was not too difficult to make. `` There's other things I want to do _ like living without this sword hanging over your head,'' said <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, 39, who scored the first 69 `` Vice'' episodes, delivering a half-hour of music for each show. `` Every week there's a new deadline. ... It's not healthy living.'' It also forced <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his native <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968, to pass on several projects. For example, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said it pained him to turn down the chance to score `` Lethal Weapon,'' the <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson-Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> movie. `` I really like <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. That would have been fun,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said with regret. But he has few regrets about `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice,'' which created such opportunities and produced Hammer's lone No. 1 single with the TV show's theme song. Now, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> says, he's ready to return to his solo career and continue his collaborative efforts with guitar virtuoso <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>. `` I have some sketches for songs, so we're going to get together and see what they sound like. Just write and record, just the two of us, and see what happens,'' said <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, who works in a studio on his upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> estate. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> is like second nature to me.'' Hammer's initial collaborations with <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> followed the 1973 break-up of his acclaimed fusion band, <ORGANIZATION> Mahavishnu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which featured guitarist <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. These days, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said, the idea of a band does n't appeal to him any more. `` Those days are over for me. ... All through the'70s, I always had a band. I kept people on salaries year-round,'' said <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, who toured about eight months a year back then. `` Can you imagine the drain? The overhead? I do n't feel the need for that, and it just does n't make sense.'' There are a few other things Hammer finds do not make sense: American radio and music videos. `` It's a machinery, and it force-feeds people,'' he said of radio. `` Through the whole Top 40 format, it just force-feeds: ` You're now going to dig these 40 songs, and only these 40 songs. You're not going to hear anything else. `` It's just this chunk of 40 songs being jammed down people's throats ... These things are prechewed, you know?'' As for videos, <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said, `` To tell you the truth, I'm sick and tired of them. I still like music-music, as opposed to music-pictures. I think that's what I object to _ that everybody has a video, and it's always the same.'' And what does he mean by always the same? `` A run-of-the-mill boys playing guitars on the rooftops, boys playing guitars in the desert, and boys playing guitars underground,'' Hammer explained. `` And the funniest thing is these really ugly guys have these gorgeous women just climbing over them. `` They would n't do it unless they were paid a lot of money. It's just so unreal. After getting together with <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, Hammer plans to make his first live appearances in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since a 1983 benefit tour. He hopes to release another solo album, score some films and does n't rule out a return to television work He'd also be content just hanging around the house playing the piano. `` I really do n't have any mountains to climb. I've been so lucky in my life _ it's staggering,'' said Hammer. `` I do n't want to analyze it, because I might disturb something. I've been able to be successful, and to do what I love. It's great.''

 <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> has worn so many hats in his lively career that it's not surprising he's helped create a fictional hero with an identity crisis. Investigative reporter <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> returns to his supersnooping in `` Mortal Games'' -LRB- Doubleday, $ 17.95 -RRB-, the second espionage novel written by <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>.

If you buy this record, you may wish to enlist Mr. <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>'s assistance in learning the patience you'll need to get through it. `` One Mind'' is simple-minded. It starts at the beginning and never wanders far beyond, winding back and forth upon itself with no apparent direction. Lievano plays a variety of instruments, including guitars, synthesizers and drums. He is assisted by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on drums, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> on violin and <PERSON> Issac </PERSON> <PERSON> Epps </PERSON> on hand percussion. The musicianship is proficient and the production is excellent. The players turn in a nice riff here or a soft phrase there and, if you like this sort of technical mastery of the soul, the record delivers. For this reviewer, though, the overall effect was less than zero. This record has its roots in the 1970s. It is derivative of <LOCATION> Chick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corea </LOCATION>'s `` Return to Forever'' and <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON>'s playing sounds suspiciously like that of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponty </PERSON>, who rocketed out of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the'70s on a bow and an electric violin and has been laying down the same tracks ever since. With apologies to Mr. <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, an ancient <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> philospher once said, `` You ca n't step in the same river twice.''

 You've heard it before and you'll hear it again: The success of your paint job will depend on how much time and effort you put into the preparation. It's nice to see the paint transform your lackluster walls and ceilings into gleaming brightness or unblemished freshness, but the pleasure will disappear quickly if you have n't prepared the surfaces properly. Proper preparation means freeing the interior of loose dirt, peeling paint, oil and grease. It also means spackling all cracks and holes with spackling compound or patching plaster. The patches should be primed before the final coat of paint goes on, but read the label on the paint can to determine the manner of treatment. Some professionals and many do-it-yourselfers apply a primer even when no patching has been done. It is especially important that any gloss be removed from the surfaces, since new paint does not adhere well to slick or shiny walls and ceilings. The gloss can be steel-wooled, sanded or given a coat of a special liquid that dulls the shine. Unlike a few years ago, oil and latex paints can be used fairly well over each other, but a primer will insure an excellent result. The assumption is that you will be using a good paint, since it is poor economy to choose a low-quality paint when it is your own `` elbow grease'' that is being utilized. Latex paints have little or no odor and make it easier to clean up after the job is completed. Follow the rule-of-thumb that a high gloss paint usually is more washable, resists moisture and wears well, which is why it is preferred in kitchens and bathrooms. Flat paints are the choice in most living rooms and bedrooms, being easier on the eyes. A semi-gloss paint is what the name implies, about halfway between the gloss and flat. The ideal way to prepare a room for painting is to remove everything from it, but this may be impractical. At least take out the lighter objects, moving the heavier pieces to the center of the room and covering them with a dropcloth or whatever is handy. All electrical switch plates, doorknobs, etc., can be taken off, but be extra careful about exposing any electric wires. Ceiling fixtures can be dropped slightly to make the painting easier. In a casual room, you might want to try unusual effects. There are special rollers to give you offbeat results. You can do the same thing by dragging or swirling brushes, whisk brooms, sponges and rags across the paint while it is still wet, keeping in mind that easy does it if you want to avoid a mess. To find out what kind of results these gimmicky styles of painting will produce, try practicing on something like a piece of scrap wallboard. When you have estimated the amount of paint you will need, it's a good idea to buy an extra amount For one thing, you always find something more you want to paint to blend in with the room. It may be only a bookcase or two, but if you have it on hand, it can be used at some later time for a touch-up job. Buying the same kind of paint at a future time does not always assure that the shade will be identical with the original. Some people just do n't order enough the first time because they do n't want to pay for unused paint. But many paint dealers will take back an unopened can if too much time has n't elapsed. Should you think that might be a problem, ask the dealer about the possibility. You may want to get on with the painting and not worry about whether you are trying to make a room seem larger or smaller, but if the latter concerns you, the proper color is the answer. Want to make something in a room `` disappear''? Paint it the same color as the room itself. Want to make it stand out? Paint it a contrasting color. If a room is long and narrow and you want it to seem a bit shorter, using white paint on two of the walls and a soft warm color on the two end walls will do the trick. When a side wall is painted white or a cool color, the room will appear to be wider. In the same way, a hallway that is too narrow can be made to seem wider if a side wall is painted white or cool. Warm colors _ red, yellow, red-orange, yellow-orange and variations of red _ make a room warm. Cool colors _ blue, green and their many shades _ make it cool. Thus, theoretically, rooms which get very little sunlight are best painted warm colors, those with lots of sunlight cool colors. In actuality, other factors, including the shapes of the rooms and their decorative features, usually affect the choice of colors, not to mention personal preferences.

 Spring fashions will be sealed with a kiss from the'60s _ but bows and bubbles will replace love beads this time around. The mood is flirty and fun _ romantic and dramatic. And body-conscious. Short skirts were the most obvious blast from the past as designers revealed their upcoming lines. The tent dress _ mini, of course _ was revived by <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vittadini </PERSON>. Some models piled plastic bangle bracelets up their arms. And there was plenty of Flower Power: frequent floral prints; skirts curved and layered like upside-down tulips; fabric flowers _ attached as a simple corsage or, ala <PERSON> Betsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>, stuck all over the dress. But the stark options of the'60s also have been tempered with plenty of old-style chiffon and elegant silk, along with buoyant skirts, frothy sleeves, pretty sundresses and even a few bustles. Fanciful, pumpkin-shaped bubble skirts appeared frequently, along with a less-radical version that's been dubbed a `` collapsed bubble.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> took bubbles one step beyond, turning them into bustles, ruffles and stand-up collars. Lace, sequins and gleaming, intricate beadwork also made for after-dark glamour. Day or night, black and white still prevailed, along with bold teal, fuchsia and goldenrod yellow. Polka dots, ruffles, big buttons and bows cropped up often _ the latter in every conceivable location. Waists were nipped and accented with wide belts or sashes. Shoulders were bared in strapless, bustier sundresses and off-the-shoulder jackets and dresses. When it came to gams, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON>'s collection was the leggiest of the lot. One strapless, green and yellow cotton dress by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcasiano </PERSON> was too snug and short for anything but mincing steps. <PERSON> Ronaldus </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamask </PERSON> also had some shockingly short selections. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s silk, knee-skimming tulip-shaped skirts were soft and feminine. Even a few offerings from traditionalist <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> crept slightly above the knee. To hem or not to hem? The undecided could opt for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>'s tight, beaded black dress, featuring a diagonal hem slashed from knee to thigh Or try the cookie-cutter hemlines, many to mid-calf, that spiced the new made-in-America collection by Soviet couturier <PERSON> Viyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaitsev </PERSON>. The other alternative _ trousers _ was the opposite of body-conscious: <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' loose, ankle-skimming pants; <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Karan </PERSON>'s navy pajama pants, teamed with slinky, wrapped tops; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>'s flowing palazzo pants, with ridges of delicate mushroom pleats tumbling from waist to hem; <PERSON> Ronaldus </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamask </PERSON>'s high-waisted pants, shorts or culottes with sashes. Only bike pants, like those offered by <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vittadini </PERSON>, were slim, and they often were topped with long dusters or tunics. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Beene </PERSON> favored the jumpsuit, heralding his black, crepe version with a halter neck and a swimsuit back as `` the new ballgown.'' Shorts had fashion flair, too: like <PERSON> Williwear </PERSON>'s cuffed, knee-grazing walking shorts teamed with a double-breasted blazer or a smartly cropped jacket; <PERSON> Vittadini </PERSON>'s mint-green, cuffed shorts with a bra-top and unstructured jacket. The shorts also were part of a new, below-the-waist, layered look. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>'s two-piece halter dress in a splashy print featured a wrap-around skirt that unraveled to reveal matching shorts. <PERSON> Carolina </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s billowing, black and white, silk organza skirts were cut away in front to reveal beaded camisoles and shorts. Some designers also layered dresses and skirts with petticoats, or a second skirt, peeking out from beneath. <PERSON> Williwear </PERSON>'s eye-catching Egyptian print skirt opened to show a solid-colored, cotton-eyelet skirt. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s stretchy tube-dress in black and white gingham was prettied up with a buoyant, knee-length skirt and can-can slip. <PERSON> Beene </PERSON>'s short, sweet, baby-doll circle skirts were fluffed out with petticoats. And just about every designer braved one ensemble that combined unlikely fabrics or prints. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Restivo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, for instance, showed floaty, chiffon skirts with tailored jackets.

 Suits are back in force for spring _ especially as haute couture sees the picture. They look everything from wildly extroverted to wearable for business and travel. And the crowning glory of all the couture pizazz is _ what else? _ hats. The designers let their fantasy run mad, from the sublime to the silly. For couture _ which is not for average shoppers, but serves mainly as a strong prototype for what might be found on the racks _ here are ideas to look for: Suits are nearly always waist-hugging and short, with jackets short or long to choose from, and shoulders still shaped, but more played-down than in the past. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s suits hit both day and dressy notes. His sharply-tailored long jackets with double-breasted or belted safari effects are worn with knotted chiffon scarves at the neck for softening the seriousness of the suit. Large boater-style hats give his suits a cachet of total chic. His dressier suit is plastered with a sequined cubistic design, elegance and height added by a wrapped fez hat in a different color, such as purple to contrast with a turquoise satin skirt. Dior suits are peppier than ever, but still in the daywear category. They're charmingly bouncy with stiffened, full skirts, very small waists and the crowning touch of tiny perched boater hats. <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> has brought back some great <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> ideas in suits that are just above the knee _ terrific white tweeds bordered in bicolored ribbon piping. The topper? For this spring's touch, it's a large banded straw hat overturned like a salad bowl. His slinky long suits are harbingers of next winter; he says they're definitely coming back. This is glorious news for those who want to hide their knees. They look authoritative in checked and solid ensembles with long tulip-wrapped jackets, and the salad-bowl hat becomes bigger than ever. Budding out into springtime dressy looks, <PERSON> Nini </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> showed loads of suits with layers of ruffles on skirts, dressy jackets fitted with a little padding on the shoulders, big stand-out peplum effects on long jackets. Polka dots in these flirtatious clothes are often matched with a big dotted sunhat. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON>'s silk suits come right out of the hothouse for spring, with flowers all over them _ maybe teaming black and white with bright flower prints in skirts, lapels and cuffs in ultra-fitted suits. And of course, the big-brimmed garden-party hat nearly eclipses the shoulders with flowers. More about hats: Solidly sane or simply crazy, they add a fillip to any outfit, and lots of fun to the fashion party. Sailor hats are a favorite at <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feraud </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maryll </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanvin </PERSON> opts for little flower baskets to top her fussily feminine short outfits in a collection based on her `` secret garden.'' With flowers in patterns, appliques and even sleeve shapes in these collections, naturally flowered hats are de rigueur. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> practically made a whole outfit with his gigantic yellow wildflower chapeau covering the model's face, if not her body _ which was clad in a slinging black mini. <PERSON> Kal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> added an original touch to his <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> collection with the dashing multi-layered straw hat fluted in waves like a seashell, but shaped more like a flounced stand-out skirt. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> at Dior branched out into tongue-in-cheek fantasy by pairing a feathery fright wig with all the allure of a jungle `` Hottentot'' to go with a draped zebra-striped dress. And in the devil-may-care vein, wonder boy <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> matched zany hats to some of his fanciful outfits. For a circus look, he topped a puffy-skirted short dress with a towering tube slightly curved for laughs. In a sunny beach-inspired mood, he shaped a straw hat like a whorled sea-snail. With these showy or relatively safe toppers, there are plenty of choices to try on and take home from the hat bar. But make sure you get the quick lift you'd get at a cocktail bar _ rather than a hangover.

 <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Beene </PERSON> believes the jumpsuit could become the unisex look of the future. But his svelte, black version for spring harkens feminine magic. Rising star <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> has mixed up some magic of his own in elegantly draped silk dresses. <PERSON> Beene </PERSON> describes his slinky, black, crepe jumpsuit, with a halter front and a swimsuit back, as `` the new ballgown.'' He tops it with a sharp, cropped jacket in coral, yellow or white. Another enchanting, black jumpsuit is studded with pink moons and stars. The heavenly motif appears again at the waist and neckline of a long, slightly clingy, black gown. Throughout his collection, necklines are slashed into striking geometric shapes, including stars. `` Fashion is both magic and magical,'' observes <PERSON> Beene </PERSON>. `` It's a Snow White kind of magic.'' The designer also favored polka dots, especially in baby-doll dressing dominated by short, sweet circle skirts and petticoats. One version, with an empire waistline, was strapless and sugary in white-and-black dots with curvy piping around the hemline. A strapless, black, bustier dress was zippered in front and back, with a black, full, baby-doll skirt in black-and-white dots. Many skirts landed about four inches above the knees. Beautiful, billowy coats were another of <PERSON> Beene </PERSON>'s crowning glories. A black, street-length, Phantom of the Opera coat swirled like a cape. White, scalloped lace circled its stand-up collar. Swishy, suave, calf-length raincoats were fashioned in green or gray. A short, effervescent, Ultrasuede coat in fuchsia or coral sprouted an uneven hemline. A yellow cotton sheath with a square neck and zip front is splashed with black jonquils; the matching coat had a capelike back. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>'s silk designs, in crepes, taffeta and chiffon, are based on the trim, timeless, princess silhouette. His draping provides la difference. A mint green mini-dress has a foamy cowl that floats down over the shoulders. A gold micro-mini, not for the faint-hearted, resembles a swimsuit, with draping over the bustline and a bustle effect in the back. A short, red, bustier dress looks almost like a jumper over a see-through blouse with balloon sleeves. When the Renaissance mood strikes, m ` lady would be fetching in a pink, strapless, ankle-length gown, slightly flared at the bottom, with spaghetti straps and plunging The long-sleeved bolero-style jacket rises to the midriff. The ensemble is completed with a medieval hat topped with two tall, pink horns and yards of veil.

 Hand-crocheted knits and the most feminine of stretchy laces are some of the richly textured fabrics <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> uses to create her draped and sculpted clothing for spring. The collection is unquestionably one of the most beautiful of the season. The delicate, airy weave of her fabrics _ inspired, Ms. <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> says, by her collection of lacey antique straw hats _ makes her clothing soft and feminine without artificial-looking frills, poufs or trim. `` I want women to feel beautiful in a most luxurious and sophisticated way,'' she says. Ms. <PERSON> Karan </PERSON> does n't design mix-and-match sportswear. A jacket is carefully sculpted to be worn with a certain skirt and camisole to capture the fluid line of a one-piece dress. Long `` scarf jackets'' in navy and cream stretch wool crepe, elegantly draped to one side and gathered there with a satin bow, were worn with soft, fluid <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> shorts and short skirts. Sometimes there was a hint of a lace decollete, twisted V-neck bodysuit or little camisole. Body-revealing wrapped tops also are a favorite of Ms. <PERSON> Karan </PERSON>'s, and she matched them with flowing navy pajama pants worn with elegant high-heel pumps. Ms. <PERSON> Karan </PERSON>, whose designs concentrate on fabric and shape, used understated solid colors _ navy, cream, taupe and mulberry for daytime, with red replacing mulberry for evening. Gold jewelry and buttons, with the dull shine of family heirlooms, provided a touch of brightness. Her collection easily made the transition from daytime to eveningwear, since the basic shapes of her clothing vary little. But, for evening, her fabrics attained a lustrous quality _ most apparent in her clingy lace sweaters with plunging necklines, worn over soft skirts or tucked in and cinched at the waist with satin bands. Dramatic elegance describes an off-the-shoulder, scoop-neck jacket in stretchy scarlet silk, held in place at the waist by a ribbon rose and then cut away to show a hand-crocheted skirt. The `` scarf jacket,'' with its softly draped fabric at the side, reappeared as a stunning long evening gown in navy.

 Although the bite of winter is still nipping at the heels, shops are already preparing for what promises to be one of the shortest summers in fashion history. The spring-summer of 1988 in fact marks the return of the miniskirt with hemlines so short they make <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quant </PERSON>'s version look dowdy. Champions of the new micro-mini are the Italian ready-to-wear designers who propose a variety of styles from ruffled to pleated to draped and puffed. Fabrics range from sexy leather to demure cotton and sensuous silk, but the hemline always hovers closer to the thigh than the knee. For those with scant pocketbooks, the best investment for the summer 1988 Italian style is a pair of good scissors to lop off last year's hemlines. However, the fortunate few with a fat bank account _ and a skinny figure _ have an infinite variety of minis to chose from. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, the `` Numero Uno'' in the classic tailoring of the famed made-in-Italy label, prefers to keep his summer hemlines a discreet several inches above the knee in supersoft draped skirts and culottes. <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, on the other hand, strays from his traditional line to offer the tightest shortest skirt of the season _ a black patent leather number which barely covers the buttocks. <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, who previewed the return of the mini with a daring winter skirt dubbed the `` postage stamp'' for its minute proportions, offers a minidress with wide-hooped skirt and tight-fitting bodice reminiscent of an inverted champagne glass, while <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> proposes gaily polka-dotted evening minidresses. Along with the miniskirt, the Italian designers dreamed up a myriad of sugary sweet party dresses, in pretty floral chintz and ruffled lace, matched with wide-brimmed straw hats complete with floral corsage and demure white gloves _ for the delight of the young, or at least the young at heart. The great risk, in fact, of the new Italian `` moda bambina'' is that it fall into the hands or onto the bodies of the over-aged and over-sized. Byblos is the best place to find this romantic youthful look, with its jeans dresses decorated with lace frills, and its many floral printed mini party dresses with hooped skirt. Another label that favors the party dress is <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON>, designed by extravagant <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON>. His petticoated floral printed minidress with oversized puffed sleeves and matching wide-brimmed hat is so young looking it would be a hit at a birthday party for 3-year-olds. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> also picked up on the party theme in his evening wear, designing gaily printed and ruffled floor length evening gowns, with enticing bodice, and puffed petticoated skirt, reminiscent of a fairytale milkmaid. Fortunately, the Italian designers never forget that they started out a decade ago as the inventors of the tailored classical look, and therefore along with the minis and the party dresses they offer plenty of elegant outfits for summer office and city life _ <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>'s pastel colored linen safari suit, and navy and white striped cashmere pullover; <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>'s ankle-length rose printed shirt waist cinched at the waist by a wide brown belt, and <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>'s feminine plaid blazer and cropped black and white floral printed jacket On the whole, jackets were man-tailored and long, sometimes covering the scanty attire below. The place to look for an overall fashionable spring-summer of 1988 is Armani who, while taking inspiration from the new trends, did not sacrifice elegance and wearability for creativity. The new Armani look is based on a very simple daytime silhouette: a classic polo shirt or the newer fencing blouse, a pair of loose trousers or a gently draped skirt or culotte only several inches above the knee, and either a man-tailored double breasted blazer, or a V-necked jacket, all in super soft fabrics and delicate pastel shades. Summer colors come right out of a box of watercolors: peach apricot and rose, acqua blue and green, cream and beige. Bright fruit shades such as grape, cherry and raspberry, or lemon, orange and lime are cheerful alternatives. High heels are back again, to put even more distance between the hemline and the floor, but there are also plenty of comfortable flat daytime sandals. Italian designer clothes were never cheap, but rising costs in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the falling dollar have made prices soar almost as much as hemlines. An Armani outfit made up of jacket, shirt and trousers or skirt rings up to the shocking figure of over $ 2,5 OO, but compared to $ 600 for a Ferre mini only 10 inches long, it is positively a bargain

 Turning one pair of women's shoes into a fashionable four is not necessarily a magician's trick, according to footwear fashion consultants. It can be done by any woman with a few handmade, European-inspired accessories. The accessories can give a simple pair of pumps at least four different looks, according to <PERSON> Suzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kressel </PERSON>, director of accessory marketing for <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, a New York-based company. The accessories, called `` Shoetooz,'' use fabrics ranging from rich satins and faille to bright tulle and fine leathers. Italian plastics also are used as well as metals such as antique gold and silver. Styles include a wide variety of shapes and sizes, including bows, rosettes, buttons, tassels and geometric patterns, with prices ranging from $ 10 to $ 35, says Ms. <PERSON> Kressel </PERSON>. The classic, leg-slimming pump also has been given a new look by <PERSON> Hush </PERSON> <PERSON> Puppies </PERSON>, a footwear manufacturer specializing in comfortable shoes. According to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, company president, although flat shoes have dominated the fashion scene in the past few seasons, the pump traditionally has been the cornerstone of a woman's wardrobe, due to its versatility, working equally as well with casual, dressy or business clothes. `` Now the classic pump has been updated,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> says. `` We've added some new interest, such as snake skinned patterns, sling-backs, and gold tips. The spectator pump _ with contrasting blue and white or black and white _ will also be a bold look for spring.'' To showcase the classic pump, he adds, the white, pale, or nude leg is making a comeback, stimulated by the new romantic and feminine movement in clothing.

 Sun-worshiping women from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> this summer will wear a blend of stripes, animal patterns and floral designs that celebrate an active lifestyle and physical zest, swimwear industry experts say. Women want suits that `` portray an image of physical fitness, whimsical sensuality, fashion awareness and success,'' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who designs for Los Angeles-based Jag swimwear. `` Our body styling, color and print attitudes are very fashion forward, on top and unafraid,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> added. In other words, the suits are being designed for young women who value success and who cultivate the Body Beautiful. Other lines being offered this year are similarly bold and revealing, including those made by <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> DeWeese </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, all of which have West Coast manufacturing facilities. In coming weeks, cash registers will be ringing from purchases of yardage with texture that feature ribs, puff prints, Lycra, silk, cotton and rubber. All are intended to make a day at the beach a visual as well as a physical exercise. The Anne Cole Collection offers a neoprene wet suit that is a provocative bikini with a hint of scuba diving adventure to it. The cost: $ 75. <PERSON> Jantzen </PERSON> also features a zippered vest suit dubbed the `` Sea Hunt,'' which diver <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> would doubtless appreciate. `` In designing Jag swimwear, the creative ideas come from my own active lifetyle, sporting events, international attitudes, trends and travel,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Still, even those who achieve less than the image of perfection portrayed by the swimsuit models will likely be able to find a suit that works for them. Such outfits are called `` solution suits.'' Prints can camouflage figure faults more than solids. A sheath or skirted suit can hide heavy hips. A maillot made with a girdle in the tummy area offers another solution. Women who buy the DeWeese, <PERSON> Jag </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> products will find retail prices starting around $ 25 and topping about $ 60. <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an international manufacturer, prices a bit higher with many offerings in the $ 80 range. Swimwear, however, is n't limited to the beach anymore. <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> also makes accessories that render swimwear acceptable for evening wear and social events, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> offerings feature maillots, bikinis and thongs, along with swimming minis that can be worn to town and flounced skirts and stretch dresses `` for dancing'til dawn.'' Some of the influence of last year's popular choices can be seen in animal and floral prints, which remain popular. Metallic fabrics are out at <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION>, according to June Wylie of the Los Angeles-based swimwear manufacturer. `` They have been replaced with a subtle hint of foil _ just enough to catch the eye and hold it.'' Stripes are also back on the fashion menu, she said. `` Stripes, stripes, stripes,'' she said. `` Vertical, diagonal, horizontal or interjected with more stripes are the active ingredients of some of the newest patterns,'' said <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> is offering suits in colors that feature rich earthen tones of sienna, taupe or charcoal, gentle pastels of mint, coral, pink lilac and ice blue. Fruit colors are also on the fashion plate, such as cherry, grape, raspberry or apple green, she said. <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> colors include red, jade, yellow, turquoise, pink, bronze, denim and champagne. <ORGANIZATION> Gottex </ORGANIZATION> textures involve weaving techniques that feature puckered, crinkled, seersuckers and metallics. At DeWeese, the company describes its as `` young in spirit, yet well-bred in its silhouettes and level of sophistication.'' `` Nothing is more permanent in fashion than good taste,'' said designer <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Roese </PERSON> in a statement of her philosophy.

 In 35 years at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, the men's clothing store founded by his great-great grandfather, <PERSON> Ashbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> saw the shirt breast pocket come and the back collar button go He survived the store's first sale, its first women's department and the demise of the pull-over dress shirt. He was there the day suits _ stacked on tables for more than a century _ finally were hung from racks. But Wall, the last member of the <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> family to work there, says nothing changed faster than the number of stores. By 1975, the year he retired, there were 16. `` I did n't see how we could keep expanding and keep our image,'' he said in a recent interview. `` We had begun to run out of sophisticated cities.'' Today, <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> has 48 stores around the country, many of them in shopping malls. They've popped up in cities from <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. There are 14 stores, named <PERSON> Burukusu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buradasu </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' main store still is on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and its mainstays still are the button-down cotton shirt and the three-buttoned, natural-shouldered suit coat. But the rapidly growing chain `` is n't the store I knew,'' says Wall, 72. The store that became <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> was founded by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> in 1818 near lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s port district. In 1850 the store, which specialized in ready-made clothing, was renamed <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> by the founder's five sons. It sold <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> his uniforms, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> his capes and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> his pajamas. When <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was assassinated, he was wearing a <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> suit. <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' button-down shirt resulted when company president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> early in the century, noticed that polo players held down their collar points with buttons to keep them from flapping. It was the first of several American introductions: the Shetland sweater -LRB- 1904 -RRB-; the polo coat -LRB- 1910 -RRB-; the lightweight cotton suit -LRB- 1930 -RRB-; the Dacron-and-cotton shirt -LRB- 1953 -RRB-. After <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>'s bought the store following World War II, Ashbel Wall became its link with the past. `` I was there to keep the continuity,'' he explained. `` I was the last one in the family to work there -LRB- so -RRB- I was the arbiter of what was <LOCATION> Brooksy </LOCATION> and what was n't. One of my responsibilities was answering the mail and saying, ` I'm a member of the family, and we're doing things the same as ever.''' Well, almost. For years the pocketless shirt was a <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> trademark, although the company would add a pocket for those who wanted it _ at no extra cost. But after the vest went out of style, more and more customers began asking for pockets, and in the late 1960s the pocket became standard. Now it is the pocketless shirt that must be specially ordered _ at no extra cost.

The specialty store entered the women's apparel market three years ago with the idea that executive women are tired of looking like male clones and want their clothing to be distinguished, but with a soft, feminine touch. `` I think one of the reasons we've been as successful as we have is that we understand this lady is a lady _ she's not a man,'' says <PERSON> Coleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 39, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Alcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. Advertisements for the store's 11 outlets across the country show beautiful, blond women with an impeccably coiffed <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> look. The company's president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON>, 43, bristled at the suggestion that his store has something in common with <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're traditional clothiers. We're in the fashion business,'' he said. For instance, <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> notes that <ORGANIZATION> Alcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> had no hesitations about embracing the short skirt for the fall season. And Ms. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says customer response has been `` tremendous.'' `` We think the knee is quite stylish, quite appropriate,'' she says. Ninety-eight percent of the stores' merchandise, <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> says, is designed by talent inside the company. He and Ms. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> want their apparel to appeal to executive women, `` presidents of country clubs'' and wives of `` very successful men.'' The one common characteristic shared by them all, Ms. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says, is that they are `` successful.'' The store strives for a refined yet efficient atmosphere. Classical music and antique furniture aim to sooth the harried shopper. Merchandise is grouped in complementary color blocks so a woman can put together a total wardrobe without searching for a blouse or jacket to go with a skirt. And ready to help her in her selections are some of the highest paid salespeople _ called `` wardrobe consultants'' _ in the retail business. `` They can make upwards to $ 50,000 a year. ... And the norm is between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 a year,'' <PERSON> Jeffries </PERSON> says. `` Our customer is traditionally a hard-working executive woman who does n't have time to wait unattended for sales help or to check out,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says. <ORGANIZATION> Alcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> is a privately held company whose 1987 sales are expected to exceed $ 50 million.

 One of the great modern classics was born late last century when <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorillard </PERSON> attended the <ORGANIZATION> Tuxedo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional white-tie-and-tails autumn ball wearing a short-jacketed suit and satin lapels. The formal wear, called the tuxedo ever since, came to symbolize the epitome of elegance and style. Immortalized by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> and brought to the heights of sophistication by <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, the tuxedo has changed little since its auspicious beginning. Now, although it was ravaged during the 1970s with ruffles, wide lapels and pastel colors, the basic black `` tux'' is back _ with a few exceptions. The traditional black tuxedo is single vented with notch lapels and natural sloping shoulders, according to <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Screiber </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> A.T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, one of the oldest formal wear establishments. `` People who bought designer tuxedos two or three years ago are coming back and renting because their tuxedos are no longer in style,'' said <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>. He said tuxedos should be worn with a white, studded formal shirt with a turned down collar, and black patent lace-ups or pumps. But this does n't mean there are n't variations. People are experimenting with different colored cummerbunds and ties. Some, mostly the young, are opting for the wing tip collar. Certain accessories also are becoming popular, says <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>. `` More people are requesting white silk scarfs, gloves, spats and even top hats.'' Although all of the big designers make a tuxedo, the bulk sold today come from two major companies: After Six and Lord West. After Six, designed by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>, is more in the classic tradition. The selections from <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, designed by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, have more of a European flair.

 The miniskirt may be back, but it's more formal and refined than the thigh-high hemlines of the 1960s, says <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, Pulitzer Prize novelist and fashion commentator. The more sophisticated minis, she says, may be an expression of women's confidence at work and in the economy. `` When things are good economically, skirts tend to go up. If we're happy and carefree, we begin to act and dress like children. The miniskirt is part of this general phenomenon,'' she says. `` When we were young, we wore very short skirts; children still do. But there's an age beyond which you have to be in absolutely wonderful shape to wear a miniskirt, maybe 40.'' <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> won the fiction Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for the novel `` Foreign Affairs'' and also wrote `` The War Between the Tates.'' She is an English professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here in narrative writing, folklore and children's literature. A native of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, she was raised in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and is the mother of three grown sons. She is also the author of `` The Language of Clothes,'' written in 1981, in which she said that the lacy, baby-doll style of the 1960s made `` grown women look like toddlers with a glandular affliction, or like severely retarded nubile teen-agers.'' The miniskirts, she said, seemed `` ridiculous rather than seductive.'' In the beginning, `` it was said that men would n't be able to concentrate on their work if they had ` beautiful chicks' running around in brightly colored clothes,'' she says. `` Women had to scrape their hair back into buns and wear dark, depressing clothes that hid the figure. `` Those clothes were boring. Women are not used to wearing the same thing every day the way men are; they could n't put up with it. Now that they are confident in their jobs, they can kick up their heels a little and stop wearing such a dreary costume.'' It was consumer demand, not designer contrivance, that brought the miniskirt back, she says, noting that so far the skirts seem more popular away from work than at the office.

 Braces. Suspenders. Straps. By whatever name, those bands over the shoulders that hold up your pants or skirt are holding up as fashion statements, too. `` They have become so popular that most trousers are being manufactured today suspender button-ready,'' says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> menswear. `` As with ties, suspender styles are more exotic,'' he says, `` as opposed to the standard solid blue or black of recent years.''

 Paper hats are old hat, but paper bathing suits? And paper pajamas? Designer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> has created a line of `` paper couture,'' 15 paper designs for resort, holiday and bridal fashions _ all recyclable. The designs _ from jogging apparel and tennis whites to sailor suits and evening dresses _ are made of paper interfacing, a material commonly used for garment linings. Each design in what Ms. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> calls the `` Symbol Signature'' collection carries the paper recycling symbol of three revolving arrows. `` In the tradition of the Polo pony and Guccis Gs, I'd like to see the recycling symbol become the newest symbol of fashion savoir-faire,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, owner of the Los Angeles-based Country Elegance boutique, who introduced paper wedding gowns to the fashion industry two years ago. `` There are many advantages to paper clothes,'' she says. `` They can be personalized with a pen, altered with a pair of scissors and repaired with Scotch tape.''

A shirtwaist, for example, opens halfway down the front for easy `` step-in'' dressing and fastens with a zipper-like strip of Velcro to eliminate buttoning. An `` Elegant Ease'' line has back-opening apparel for women who use wheelchairs. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> say they worked with occupational and physical therapists to develop the clothing. Research, they say, showed many women between the ages of 46 and 65 needed pants that did n't require pulling on Many others had difficulty with buttons or hooks-and-eyes. Their line of clothing includes dresses, undergarments, evening clothes and sportswear.

 Maiden modesty has been out of style for decades. And for religious women, that once meant settling for dowdy clothes. But now, a small fashion industry is growing up around covering up. Far from mousy, the clothes at these boutiques are the best Italian and French imports _ at up to $ 1,000 a dress. `` I buy things that are fashion forward,'' said <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalatsky </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s Den, which caters to Orthodox Jewish women in affluent <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, N.Y. Many Orthodox Jewish women wear sleeves that cover the elbow, skirts that cover the knee, and high necklines. Many of the same dress restrictions apply to Moslem women, said Dr. M.T. <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, Moslem women are more likely to hire dressmakers or make their own clothes, according to <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> couturier with a Moslem clientele. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s Den and other shops like it cull appropriate fashions from top designers' collections. That saves the Orthodox shopper from weeding out what she ca n't wear. Ms. <PERSON> Kalatsky </PERSON> said she also gets manufacturers to run off a batch of clothes with longer hems and sleeves. Or she may order fabric swatches so the customer can fill in a neckline. Since long skirts have been in style for 15 years, Orthodox Jewish women who want to look great have had it pretty easy, said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Novitsky </PERSON>, manager of Kutiel Fashions in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. But now, `` everything coming from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is a mini,'' she said. `` I predict a problem in the coming year.'' Ms. <PERSON> Novitsky </PERSON> pointed out that Orthodox women do shorten their skirts when the styles are shorter. In the 1960s, `` more religious women were walking around with skirts right by their knees.'' But as calf-length caught on, the shorter skirt became unacceptable. Now, she says, the women who shop at <LOCATION> Kutiel </LOCATION> _ including the manager _ could have stepped out of <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION>. `` OK, my leopard hat and bag do help,'' she said.

 GQ and <PERSON> Esquire </PERSON> are unquestionably the leading magazines in the men's fashion and lifestyle field. But publisher <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> sees an affluent buying pie out there and he wants a piece of the market. So he started MGF _ for <ORGANIZATION> Men </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION> to Fashion _ three years ago. It's aimed at the younger end of the `` well-healed'' market, the 18-to-29-year-olds, and <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> says his circulation is up near 200,000 now. A <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> _ who once worked at <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> _ is also the publisher of the rock magazine Circus, now in its 18th year. But, he says, as an independent publisher, he finds it `` dangerous'' to rely on the revenue of one magazine. So, for years, he says, he's been looking for another kind of publication. He hit on MGF after reading a Sunday newspaper story by a feminist who bemoaned the yuppie male generation as `` peacocks only interested in themselves and their clothes.'' As an entrepreneuer, he saw in that not a social statement but a business opportunity: there's a market there. Others see similar opportunity in sharing the magazine market for younger men, including Men's Look and Ebony Man. Like the others, the monthly MGF is not just about clothing styles. It has regular features on grooming and hair style as well as columns on fitness, a `` sex advisor'' and lifestyle articles such as these in the March issue: `` The Truth About Steroids,'' `` Your Power Breakfast'' and `` She's Your Friend _ Can She Be Your Lover?'' <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON>, who serves as fashion editor as well as editor in chief and publisher, personally visits various designers, selected to reflect his reading market, then boils it down to a `` point of view'' aimed at his readership. He calls it `` selective reporting.'' And the men's `` look'' for this spring and summer? `` Loose and comfortable,'' he says, `` with style.'' First, `` the right lightweight suit. Then, open a button or throw on a polo shirt for that dressed-down, casual look. It's not only comfortable for spring. It's a smart-looking way to lounge around.''

 For men, the suit still is the thing to wear, whether it's for a corporate look or a casual one with a T-shirt. Yet, many men do n't know what to look for when buying a suit. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeneman </PERSON>, a private label manufacturer which has recently started its own line of `` power clothing'' suits called DeRigueur, offers this advice: _ When you try on a suit, put everything you normally carry with you _ glasses, pens _ in the pockets Stand normally; do n't correct your posture. Wear shoes you would wear with the suit. _ Shoulders should be wide enough to allow a straight drop along the outside of the sleeve, from the top edge to the cuff They should lie evenly and smoothly. _ Jacket length should be long enough to cover the seat entirely _ The jacket collar should lie smoothly against the back of the neck _ Lapels should lie flat when the jacket is completely buttoned _ Three-eighths of an inch of shirt cuff should show below jacket sleeve _ There should be no pulling on the pants through the hips, no tugged-open pleats, no strain across the pockets _ Trouser hems should fall to the top of the shoe, producing a slight break Most important, says <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeneman </PERSON>: If it does n't fit, do n't buy it. Never have extensive alterations.

 The look in women's hair fashions this spring is natural and decidedly female, according to hairstylists. `` Hair will have a soft natural look; it wo n't be quite as full as in previous seasons,'' says <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, director of style training for Regis Hairstylist salons. `` We will also see a variety of exciting new styles. There wo n't be just one specific look that is this year's hot trend,'' he adds `` The best new looks are close and shapely. Tops will be left long for lots of permed-in texture and movement. New perm wrap methods are essential to create unusual finishes with texturized volume,'' says <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. Xenon, international creative director for the <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> professional division, says, `` Women are finally learning that looking professional does n't mean the same as looking masculine. `` The more subdued feminine fashion looks shown for spring allow hair to make an important, dramatic statement of its own,'' says <PERSON> Xenon </PERSON>, in introducing a collection of perm styles for this spring. `` Hairstyles today are highly sculpted, yet must remain soft and touchable. The only way to achieve this sculpted look without weighing hair down with sticky, brittle sprays and gels is through perming.'' As for length, he says, `` anything goes.'' `` Hair length is not really an issue this spring. The key to this season's most up-to-date looks is volume and softness. Curls are softer and looser; waves have more definition; all hairstyles move and shine. `` Most of my styles involve lifting the hair up and away from the face, emphasizing the individual woman's facial features. After all,'' he says, `` what could be sexier or more feminine than a woman's face?''

 Have you ever reached for a magazine to pass the time in a doctor's waiting room and come up with an election analysis _ of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s victory in 1976? Or gotten interested in a magazine story only to find the conclusion was missing, along with the rest of page 87? Who has n't found outdated or tattered magazines in the doctor's office <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knoxville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is prescribing a package of six new magazines designed to fit the reading habits of people waiting for the doctor. But the idea makes some magazine publishers ill. They object to a key feature of the Whittle package, which asks subscribers to have no more than two magazines from other publishers in their offices. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said the provision lets him charge advertisers more for an uncluttered, relatively exclusive publishing environment. `` I'm taken aback by it,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazines </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Good Housekeeping and Redbook. `` It is putting other publishers in a position where they are not able to sell their product.'' Some advertising agency executives also question Whittle's proposal `` If he believes his editorial product is so great, why is it necessary to eliminate what he refers to as the worn-out, dog-eared and soiled waiting room magazines?'' asks <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostyra </PERSON>, media services director for the advertising agency <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Whittle has heard all the objections and parodies some of them in a series of full-page advertisements that have appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. In one ad, this headline appears over a photo of a torn and smudged magazine page: `` Few things equal the special quality of magazines in a doctor's waiting room.'' In another full-page ad, a mob is shown assaulting a cowering man. `` Few things have brought magazine publishers together the way ` Special Reports' has,'' reads the ad. Special Report is the name for six new Whittle magazines to begin appearing quarterly in 15,000 doctors' waiting rooms in September. The titles are Families, Sports, Fiction, Health, Living, and Personalities. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said each magazine is designed to be read in 27 minutes, which he said is the average time spent in a doctor's waiting room. The magazines are being offered only to three types of doctors: obstetricians-gynecologists, pediatricians and family practitioners. Whittle declines to disclose the subscription price but says it will be below the typical $ 200-300 a year that doctors now spend on magazine subscriptions. But Whittle's proposal goes a lot further than a simple magazine subscription. He said he will provide three to four copies of each of the six titles and a magazine rack to display them. His staff will deliver the magazines in person and return monthly to replace any that have been taken or abused. `` No other company is beginning to provide the level of service and numbers of magazines that we are going to provide,'' he said in an interview. What Whittle asks in return is the assurance that Special Reports be the `` primary magazines'' in the office, with no more than two other titles around. The requirement enables Whittle to offer advertisers exclusivity in their product categories that will help their messages stand out. Special Report magazines will carry 30 pages of ads in every 64-page issue and no competing products _ only one coffee advertiser per issue, for instance. The minimum ad purchase is one page each quarter for a year in all six magazines, a total of 24 ad pages. The price: $ 1.2 million. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said category exclusivity and the expectation that the magazines will reach over 70 percent of all the mothers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who have two or more children make his magazines worth the price for some advertisers. He said the company already has sold 20 of the 30 available advertisements for the first two years, but declined to identify the buyers. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spender, describes itself as `` very interested'' in the magazines. `` We are continuing to explore it in depth, but have not yet signed any agreements,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said. Rival publishers say readers may be bored by the Whittle magazines. `` Who would want to pick up a generic quarterly when you can read the current issue of People, Time or <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s?'' asks <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woman-McCall </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which also publishes Working Mother. But <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said he has recruited some of the finest editors in the country, led by editor-in-chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rukeyser </PERSON>, the former managing editor of Fortune and founding editor of Money. Rivals have warned they may take legal action over the issue of limiting other magazines in waiting rooms that take Whittle's service <ORGANIZATION> Rodale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Prevention and Children magazines, has written 40,000 pediatricians, warning that <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>'s proposal raises legal issues that could result in `` a waiting room battle, one likely to be settled in court, one that could only cause unfavorable publicity for doctors in the program,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Rodale </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneback </PERSON> But <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said he is not trying to force doctors into anything. If doctors who take his service keep more than two other magazines in their waiting rooms, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> says he simply will remove the Special Reports. `` What it gets down to is, what does the doctor prefer?,'' <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dollar Down As Pound Surges On; Gold Firmer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against all major currencies in early European trading today as the British pound continued a weeklong surge with the Conservative government split on whether to rein in sterling. Gold prices rose. Some traders said the pound was helping to depress the dollar. The pound jumped more than half a cent to $ 1.8590, compared with $ 1.8535 late Friday. The pound has risen 8 cents from a week ago. Sterling has been rising on expectations the government will announce substantial tax cuts in its annual spring budget Tuesday, and was boosted further by the government split. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> last week rejected state intervention to depress the pound, either by selling sterling or lowering interest rates _ thus overruling Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. A strong pound hurts British exports. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> believes lowering interest rates to make the pound less attractive to foreign investors will encourage borrowing and fuel inflation. After years of low-deficit budgets, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is heading for a balanced budget, or even a surplus of revenue over expenditure, for the first time in nearly 20 years. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 127.23 yen, down 0.57 yen from Friday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar slipped further to 126.55 yen. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> dealers said the dollar was depressed partly by pessimistic expectations for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> January trade figures to be released Thursday. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6575 West German marks, down from 1.6615; 1.3665 Swiss francs, down from 1.3720; 5.6325 French francs, down from 5.6515; 1.8624 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1.228.40 Italian lire, down from 1.232.55; and 1.2552 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2553 Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 441.80 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 440.50. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 441.90. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the noon bid price was $ 441.85 dollars, up from $ 441 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a $ 444.81 bid, up $ 1.27 from Saturday's closing price. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday at a bid price of $ 6.23 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.36 late Friday.

 Stocks closed lower and the dollar fell further against the yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today as traders' expectations for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for January grew more pessimistic. After opening at 127.35 yen, the dollar closed at 127.23 yen, down 0.57 yen from its close of 127.80 yen on Friday, when it fell 0.40 yen. The dollar traded in a narrow range between 127.20 yen and 127.37 yen today. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues closed at 25,433.51 points, down 110.22 points, or 0.43 percent, from Friday's close. Volume in the first section was 950 million shares, nearly half that of Friday's session. An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the market was turning its attention toward the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures for January, due to be released Thursday. `` It is hard to say how much impact the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures are having, but compared with the end of last week we're seeing a trend toward a stronger yen,'' the dealer said. Other dealers mentioned speculation that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit would be larger than previously expected. Traders in the stock market also were waiting for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, said an analyst with a major brokerage. `` Trading was not so heavy in the first section, aside from some heavy industrials, steel, and electricals,'' said the analyst, who requested anonymity. `` We are following what is happening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but the market is still strong, and what we are seeing here are adjustments,'' said a dealer, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan for retaliatory trade policies comes face to face with its long-threatened demise this week following its sponsor's poor showing on Super Tuesday Lawmakers who previously had held off on a decision now have decided to tackle the issue as they step up efforts to reach a compromise on legislation to sharpen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> edge in world markets. `` I expect the trade conference to finish its work by the end of this month and we'll get it on the president's desk some time in April,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee weighing rival versions of the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill had been hesitant to tamper with the plan that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman, has made a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Majority Democrats had sought to avoid anything that might trip up <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, whose plan is part of the House version of the trade bill but not the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration calls it veto bait and Japanese businessmen expressed elation last week when <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> carried only one of the 20 states _ his own _ where there was Super Tuesday primary and caucus voting. After that disappointing showing, Democratic chairmen decided to go ahead with action on the issue this week, congressional sources said. The so-called <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment would require the president to reduce `` excess and unwarranted'' surpluses run by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and a few other countries in trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If negotiations failed, the president would be required to use import curbs to lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate. The president could waive such action if he found it contrary to the national economic interest or if the offending country were wrestling with serious debt. But critics say the plan is a long step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees, returning from a one-week recess, planned to take up the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> proposal along with related issues of Japanese trade barriers at a closed caucus today, an aide to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member confirmed. `` Up to this point, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side has been making all the concessions and there's no question but what, come Monday, they'll be asking the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to give up <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>,'' said the aide, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees have been meeting separately and thus far the negotiations have been a ping-pong match of offers and counter offers. On its face, the senators' move to drop the plan will not amount to anything all that unusual, since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never passed the measure in the first place. It also will take some heat off of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s fellow Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who do n't want to be seen as lowering the boom on him. The House is expected to make a counter offer that most likely will be couched as an effort to rescue the main thrust of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plan. The politics involved in the issue became apparent last month. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said Feb. 21 that the `` <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> provision will be dropped We're going to dump it because it's bad policy.'' But two days later, Ways and Means Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., issued a statement saying that `` Mr. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s amendment has not been scuttled or jettisoned. He said it would be part of any eventual compromise. The key difference between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions is that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s proposal focuses on trade surpluses while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill calls on the president to retaliate against foreign barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. In tackling the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> controversy, the conferees are moving into one of the toughest issues remaining to be resolved. But it is not the only one. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees holding out for a five-year import ban on <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> products are deadlocked with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counterparts, who propose to allow the president wide latitude to discipline the Japanese company for selling submarine silencing equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The administration does not want the outright ban, neither side has shown much inclination to budge and even the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees say they are divided. There have been no meetings of a conference subcommittee weighing a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision that would require companies to give employees advance warning of plant closings and mass layoffs. The measure is not part of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill and also has been described as potential veto bait. There also have been no meetings thus far on a highly controversial amendment to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that would require disclosure of foreign ownership of property and land in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It's under huge attack from these international companies and foreign lobbyists as well as the White House that do n't want to see any disclosure of foreign ownership at all,'' says Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the sponsor of the measure. He said last week the provision probably has a 50-50 chance of getting to the president's desk

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says it will not launch a special study of a widely used herbicide suspected of causing cancer among farmers because other research has not confirmed the suspicion. A major commercial user, however, said it wo n't put the chemical back in its lineup until the cancer picture is clarified, and a scientist with an environmental group called the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` outrageous.'' The herbicide is 2,4-D, short for dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. A 1986 study said it was the fourth most widely used pesticide in the nation, with more than 39 million pounds of active ingredient sold the previous year. The great bulk of that is believed to be used for broadleaf weed control in wheat fields, though 2,4-D also is widely used on highway rights of way, on lawns and in forests. Following several scientific reports associating certain cancers with farming or exposure to various _ and sometimes unspecified _ herbicides, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 found that farmers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> who used 2,4-D more than 20 times a year, mixing their own formulations, had an eight times greater chance than normal of getting a specific cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. Home and garden users did not face concentrations large enough to cause concern, the study said. The herbicide aroused suspicion because it can be contaminated with small amounts of chemicals related to the dioxins, though there are no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reports, and only one abroad, of contamination with the most toxic form of dioxin. The contaminants of 2,4-D generally have only about 1 percent of the cancer-causing power of the most toxic dioxin. In all the controversy over dioxin, a cancer called soft-tissue sarcoma has been at the center of the issue _ and this cancer sometimes was found in the early 2,4-D reports. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> frequently puts suspicious pesticides into what it calls `` special review,'' a way of bringing the chemical to the head of the line. The agency may call for additional studies by the manufacturer and the reviews may end up with new use restrictions or an outright ban. In this case, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to begin such a review. Spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> confirmed trade press reports of the decision, describing the decision as a `` tough call.'' Animal studies, he said, `` do not suggest that it's a carcinogen,'' and `` I think there are quite a few -LRB- human -RRB- epidemiology studies'' that also fail to confirm the cancer-causing ability of 2,4-D. It is extremely rare for a chemical to cause cancer in humans but not in laboratory animals. The best example is arsenic. Officials to whom <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> referred more detailed questions did not immediately return telephone calls. The agency plans a news conference on Thursday to discuss its decision. One study of farm and forest workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> found elevated incidence of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and another cancer called multiple myeloma, but did not examine exposure to pesticides. A followup study, however, found no excess risk of cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals of the 2,4-D class. <ORGANIZATION> Chemlawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stopped using 2,4-D after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> results were announced. The company acted `` out of concern for our employees,'' of whom 2,500 to 3,000 probably were using 2,4-D on 80 days a year, said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardymon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It has arranged a study of employees by the institute, and will not decide whether to resume use of 2,4-D until results are reported, probably late next year, though <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` probably is right,'' said <PERSON> Hardymon </PERSON>. `` I think it's outrageous,'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, staff scientist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION>, said of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. She was particularly critical of the weight given to animal studies that showed no effect. `` We only do animal studies when we do n't have human studies,'' but in this case a good study of humans _ the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> farmers _ was outweighed by animal studies, she said. She said `` 2,4,5-T was banned mostly because of birth defects -LRB- among humans -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> ... and that is not anywhere near as hard to refute as the study <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> did.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today that <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has sweetened its friendly takeover bid, while <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced an extension until midnight Friday of its competing $ 6.18 billion tender offer. Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said its board of directors was meeting here today to consider a proposal from <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> `` to revise and improve the terms upon which <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s would acquire <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sluzewski </PERSON> said he could not provide details of the revision. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> currently has a definitive $ 6.1 billion agreement to acquire <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it extended its hostile offer to buy 70.5 million of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock at $ 75 a share from Tuesday until Friday to take pressure off a federal judge who was scheduled to hear arguments today on the takeover battle. The extension gives <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> more time to work on a sweetened deal. Shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s move was announced, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> urged its shareholders to hold onto their stock. On Sunday, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> had `` reluctantly'' advised stockholders to tender their shares under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s two-tier buyout offer although it was against merging with the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> developer. The unusual recommendation had been intended to ensure that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shareholders get the higher price offered under the first stage of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 75 a share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock while the remaining 20 percent would be acquired later for $ 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the deal an aggregate value of $ 68 per share. In early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock rose $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 67.37 -LCB-. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board said Sunday shareholders should tender their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> `` to insure that they are not relegated to the $ 44 back end'' in the event the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bid were successful and their shares were not tendered by the deadline. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> noted that shareholders could withdraw shares tendered to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> deadline were extended. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> has sought a federal court injunction to extend <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday expiration <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> contended <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s current offer, which was amended from an earlier $ 68 per share bid for all Federated shares, essentially is a new offer and under federal law must remain open past its scheduled expiration. A hearing was set for today on the dispute, and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also planned to ask the court to strike down <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill,'' or shareholder-rights plan, which makes an unfriendly takeover prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 74.50 per share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock in an bid that expires April 4. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> plans to swap shares in a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for the remaining 20 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said its board met Friday and unanimously reaffirmed that the definitive merger agreement with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> was superior to the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bid. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also said Sunday its directors and corporate management have insisted their stock options and restricted shares be converted to cash on the same basis as other shareholders in the Macy-Federated merger agreement. A filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> revealed last week that some 500 <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> executives would receive all cash for their stock in the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> acquisition, while other shareholders would get cash for only 80 percent of their shares. `` Senior management has taken this steop to avoid any possible implication that they would be treated better than the company's stockholders generally,'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a news release <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> owns department store chains including <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> has nearly 100 department and specialty stores, while <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said today it expects to obtain all the necessary financing to complete a buyout by the March 18 expiration date

 The number of oil and gas rigs working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decreased by 32 this week to total 946, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced. The total reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number rigs producing oil. The previous week, the count had decreased by five to 978. `` In a normal year, the low comes in late March or early April, and then begins a gradual increase from that point,'' said <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerridge </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> economist who compiles the count. `` It is not unusual for it to be coming down in March.'' <PERSON> Kerridge </PERSON> said companies usually accelerate their exploration spending as the year progresses. A year ago, the rig count stood at 761, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Houston-based <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched industry index of drilling activity. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which merged this year with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981 _ the height of the oil boom. But as oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, the count fell to 663, the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among the major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> lost 14 rigs, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lost seven, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> lost five, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> each lost three, and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> lost one apiece. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> gained three rigs, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> gained two and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gained one. The states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> showed no change.

 The stock market showed little change in quiet trading today as traders looked ahead to a busy and potentially volatile week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.97 to 2,039.95 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 582 up, 693 down and 466 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 41.01 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said traders were reluctant to take big positions in advance of the government's report Thursday on the nation's trade balance for January. The trade deficit narrowed in the last two months of 1987, but some analysts expect the January data to show a modest increase in the gap between exports and imports. This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. The past couple of witching hours have been relatively uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders. Nevertheless, analysts say uncertainty about how it will go this time has lent an added element of uncertainty to a marketplace still haunted by memories of the crash last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, up 7 -LCB- at 23 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> made a $ 21-a-share offer to acquire the company. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LCB- to 14 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> withdrew a $ 20-a-share takeover bid that <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> had opposed.

<HEAD>Two Billion New Jobs by 2030 Would Provide Full Employment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Close to two billion new jobs would have to be created by 2030 if the goal of full employment were to be attained worldwide, according to a survey published Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Citing data from the <ORGANIZATION> ILO </ORGANIZATION>'s new statistical yearbook, the survey suggested that this goal was out of reach at current levels of creating new employment. It said that globally an average 47 million new jobs are needed each year over the next four decades to cope with the population growth and absorb the `` armies of unemployed and underemployed.'' The yearbook, covering data from almost 100 nations, said women and young people continue to fare worst, but that the women's share of the workforce increased in many parts of the world. However, in some developed countries, including <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, jobless rates of women were more than double than those of men. The picture looked grimmest for young people. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, more than half of all teenagers and almost half of those between 20 and 25 were unmployed in 1986, and in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> the rates were 27.5 and 16 percent. No statistics were available for African countries where the problem is believed to be most serious in the Third World. The statistics list a decline of unemployment in 31 countries between 1985 and 1986. Improvement was most marked in Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries although they still have some of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Rates dropped from 12.1 percent to 8.7 percent in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>; from 21.8 percent to 18.9 percent in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>; from 11.8 percent to 8.2 percent in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>; and from 14 percent to 10.3 percent in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The trend was also downward in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, from 7.1 to 6.9 percent. The hardest hit European country was <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, but the rate also declined slightly from 21.9 percent to 21.5 percent. By contrast, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s rate was up from 17.8 percent to 18.2 percent. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, with a rate of 0.8 percent, ranked at the bottom of the survey. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, at 2 percent, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at 2.8 percent, also reported almost full employment.

The bid tops recent offers from rival <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> senior management. Under the approved tender offer, <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> and unnamed private investors have agreed to pay $ 61.50 for each of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' 15.5 million shares outstanding, or around $ 953.24 million. The deal is subject to a majority of the shares being tendered and the necessary financing being obtained. <PERSON> Odyssey </PERSON> said it would finance the deal through a $ 600 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.A. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 570 million of subordinated debt and preferred stock and a $ 100 million equity investment. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the offer was approved by a committee of outside directors formed last month to consider a leveraged buyout from a group led by the fifth generation member of the family that founded <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in 1813.

 <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its board rejected as inadequate a sweetened $ 450 million bid from <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and authorized the sale of a <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> subsidiary as a move to enchance shareholder value. Last week <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based cement and energy company, increased its tender offer for all of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s outstanding common stock to $ 35 per share from its previous offer of $ 31 per share. The initial offer valued the company at about $ 391 million. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> called the latest bid `` inadequate and not in the best interests'' of the company and its shareholders. `` The board of directors of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> continues to believe that remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the long-range term,'' the company said in a statement. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s board authorized the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's oil and gas subsidiary. The company said it is `` continuing to explore and investigate the variety of ... transactions intended to enhance securityholder values, other than a significant acquisition by the company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> said its tender offer was conditional upon the valid tender of a majority of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> common stock, the invalidation of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense and the acquisition of sufficient financing. <ORGANIZATION> Southdown </ORGANIZATION> produces and sells cement and ready-mixed concrete and is active in oil and gas production. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, produces building materials and is involved in oil and gas exploration and production, mainly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

 American electronics companies are starved for computer chips. Japanese chip makers are raking in windfall profits. And nobody seems quite sure what to do. This is the way of the world in the electronics industry, circa March 1988. It did n't have to be this way. The current worldwide shortage in computer chips is a classic manifestation of the Law of Unintended Consequences, one that has resulted in higher prices of electronic products and even delays in the introduction of some new computers. One big reason for the shortage is unobjectionable: Booming sales of personal computers and the retooling for a new generation of memory chips have combined to produce a cyclical squeeze on production capacity. But another reason for the shortage is that a 1986 chip agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has backfired in a way that should have been predictable. The accord, intended to benefit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip makers, was supposed to keep the Japanese from `` dumping'' chips at unfairly low prices while giving the Americans better access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge market. What actually came about was the creation of a de facto semiconductor cartel _ a legalized form of collusion that had the effect of setting prices above market levels and carving up markets. The Japanese did raise prices of memory chips, mainly by limiting production, but the main beneficiaries were just two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and tiny <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> are the only American companies still selling dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, and they are earning a windfall. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are paying more for chips than their foreign rivals pay. The consequences of that over the long term are disquieting. As for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to the Japanese market, it is not happening. It was reported in January that foreigners' share of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s market had fallen every month since June. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Americans are bumping their heads against a concrete ceiling. For one thing, the biggest consumers of chips in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are also the biggest producers. It is unlikely they will buy from Americans when they can take chips right off their own fabrication lines, although pressure on them should be continued. Most worrisome in the long run is that the high prices Japanese chip makers are fetching under the accord is giving them even more money to pour into their world-leading research and development. In exactly the same way that Japanese automakers responded to `` voluntary'' restraints by moving upscale with cars like the Honda Acura, Japanese chip makers are beginning to move upscale with more complex, expensive chips that have been the domain of the Americans. So what needs to be done? The main job, obviously, is to rebuild the American chip industry so it can compete with the Japanese without the need for a de facto cartel. The 1986 accord has already been legally challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> seems to be a step in the right direction. The organization, to be based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is financed by government and industry and will work to improve manufacturing techniques, which are considered the Achilles' heel of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip makers. A bigger problem is that many of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' leading chip makers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are only mid-sized companies that lack the deep pockets to compete with Japanese giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip buyers such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry a financial shot in the arm by buying the chip makers, but they have shown little interest in the volatile and expensive business More mergers of chip companies almost surely lie ahead. The federal government may even serve as matchmaker in some cases. But two of the most worthwhile steps to help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip business _ and thus the electronics business _ have nothing to do with integrated circuits per se. Step one would be to lower the cost of borrowing for the capital-intensive industry by cutting the federal budget deficit. Step two would be to improve the quality of American technical education, on which the industry depends. Those are long-term steps, to be sure. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not get where it is by concentrating on the short term.

<HEAD>Standard &amp; Poor's Changing its 500-Stock Index</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will restructure its widely followed index of 500 issues traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, effective April 6. S & amp; P's 500 Composite Stock Price Index will no longer contain a fixed number of industrial, utility, financial and transportation companies. The composite index currently includes four sector indices with a set number of stocks: 400 Industrials, 40 Utilities, 40 Financials and 20 Transportation companies. The investment research company said it will continue to calculate sector indices, but they will be referred to as the S & amp; P Industrial Index, the Utilities Index, the Financial Index and the Transportation Index. The composite index will still contain a total of 500 companies. Although this is the first structural change in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index since 1976, market analysts said it should n't make a significant difference for stock traders. The index, which represents more than $ 2 trillion in market value, is used as the basis for many index-linked investment funds. S & amp; P said the revamping is designed to respond to economic changes. The change `` reflects a major shift toward a more service-oriented <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, illustrated by the increasing number of highly-capitalized companies in the financial services industry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P Executive Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrialis </PERSON>. He said the change will allow <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P to be more flexible in choosing new companies for the index when openings occur and in switching companies between sectors as their businesses change. Under the current system, when a company is removed from the 500-share index, usually due to a merger or acquisition, it is replaced by another company from the same sector. Now, if a transportation company were dropped, for example, it could be replaced with an industrial, utility or financial company. S & amp; P also announced that effective April 6, <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will be transferred from its composite index to its financial index. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, divested itself in recent years of its container business and has made several acquisitions in the financial services area _ including the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Phibro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has shifted its main focus from commodities trading to financial services.

<HEAD>Arab Oil Experts Convene in Baghdad, Most Ministers Absent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> opened here Monday with many key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> oil ministers staying away from the missile-threatened <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. The absence of influential oil ministers made it unlikely, in the view of experts, that significant action could be taken to deal with the current imbalance between oil prices and production. In addition to debating price and production, the conference will consider some 50 papers on a variety of energy-related subjects. Sources said emphasis will be given to the petrochemical industry. One paper to be discussed makes the point that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries produce 22.1 percent of the world's oil but less than 3 percent of the world's petrochemicals. Another paper prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the Arab world has 57.3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and 17.2 percent of the world's proven gas reserves with major potential for increasing reserves of both fuels with new technology <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Chalabi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and his Saudi counterpart, <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, were the only oil ministers from major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> oil-exporting countries present among 550 delegates to the four-day conference. Though oil ministers of major Arab oil-producers gave personal or professional reasons for their absences, sources suggested the recent missile attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on each others' capitals may have contributed to ministerial cancellations. Seven Arab nations are among 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Ten Arab nations belong to the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting States, a sponsor of the conference along with the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers missing were from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A paper before the conference notes that Arab oil income from oil was $ 178 billion in 1981 and $ 52 in 1986. The oil cartel is currently facing deteriorating oil prices as production exceeds demand. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to prop up its official price of $ 18 per barrel. But member nations have been forced to give discounts to match market prices several dollars lower. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers are divided on whether to lower production quotas in order to defend the official price or to lower the price to defend their share of the market against non-OPEC producers.

 Stock prices marked time in quiet trading today as traders looked ahead to a potentially volatile week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.49 to 2,036.47 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 619 up, 841 down and 439 unchanged. Analysts said traders were reluctant to take big positions in advance of the government's report Thursday on the nation's trade balance for January. The trade deficit narrowed in the last two months of 1987, but some analysts expect the January data to show a modest increase in the gap between exports and imports. This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. The past couple of witching hours have been relatively uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders. Nevertheless, analysts say uncertainty about how it will go this time has lent an added element of uncertainty to a marketplace still haunted by memories of the crash last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Grolier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, up 8 -LRB- at 24. <ORGANIZATION> Hachette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> made a $ 21-a-share offer to acquire the company. <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> climbed 5 \ to 61 The company agreed to be acquired for $ 61.50 a share by an investor group. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -LRB- to 15 -LRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> withdrew a $ 20-a-share takeover bid that <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> had opposed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>'s second foray into the gold industry fell short Monday when the group, controlled by oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, withdrew its $ 1.88 billion cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> released a statement saying it retracted its offer to obtain the entire equity interest in <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>, a leading gold producer, with a negotiated transaction for a price of $ 20 per share in cash <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batchelder </PERSON> said the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> had rejected <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s bid. But he offered no explanation for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s move. The partnership made a cash offer on Feb. 29 for the 93 million outstanding common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> already controlled about 3.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. The Mesa statement said its offer was rejected March 7 by the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> as `` inadequate and not in the best interests of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> and its shareholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> had 1987 earnings of $ 146.4 million, two-thirds coming from <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of its interests in an Australian mining operation. The company's stock traded between $ 18 and $ 24 a share before the Oct. 19 stock market plunge. When <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> general partner, announced his offer, <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> stock shot up $ 3.50 to about $ 18.50 per share. Late in Monday's session, it stood at $ 15.12 -LCB- per share, down $ 1.12 -LCB- on the New York Stock Excange. `` The Street did n't seem to be that excited about his going after <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> investment firm in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. Wall Street analysts said they did not perceive <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> as a good buy. `` Obviously, he did or he would n't have gone after them,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> took the bid seriously. `` You always take him seriously,'' <PERSON> Stumbo </PERSON> said, adding he did not know if <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s withdrawal was the end of its takeover efforts. <ORGANIZATION> Homestake </ORGANIZATION> holds interests in oil and natural gas and mines uranium, silver and gold, as does <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another major gold producer targeted in an earlier, unsuccessful hostile takeover bid by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> was approached last year by <ORGANIZATION> Ivanhoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a group led by <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, which made a $ 2 billion hostile bid for control of the company. A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court blocked the move in October when it upheld a `` market sweep'' in which <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, grabbed enough shares in a two-day buying spree to raise its holdings to nearly 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> and thwart the hostile bid <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' reputation as a corporate raider was made with high-profile bids for several major oil companies in the early 1980s, including <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> launched hostile takeover attempts, then pocketed millions of dollars in profits when some of the target companies either were bought out by a higher bidder or repurchased their own stock

 <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is considering offering <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> a cash infusion of at least $ 1 billion to help persuade <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to sell <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> a majority interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, according to a published report. A <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined comment on the report carried in Monday's editions of the Wall Street Journal. Officials at Husky, based in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, did not return phone calls. The Journal said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, co-chairman of Husky, said in an interview he remains very interested in acquiring the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> unit and will step up his efforts in a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> added that Husky would be willing to pay $ 2.4 billion to $ 2.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 78 percent interest in the Toronto-based unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the Journal said. The estimated purchase price does not include the possible $ 1 billion cash infusion from Husky, the Journal said. It was not immediately clear what form a cash infusion might take. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> told the Journal he hopes to present <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> a `` mutually attractive plan'' under which the two Canadian companies would merge under Husky's control. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> would have to sell enough of its interest to give Husky a stake of at least 51 percent. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said his recent phone messages have not been answered by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is planning to sell about $ 3 billion in assets as part of its plan to emerge from Chapter 11 protection by late next month. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law last April to forestall enforcement of a $ 10.3 billion damages judgment for interfering with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> settled the dispute in December by agreeing to pay <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion.

 A flurry of buying just before the close enabled stock prices to post a gain in a quiet session today. Analysts said traders were reluctant to take big positions in advance of the government's report Thursday on the nation's trade balance for January. The trade deficit narrowed in the last two months of 1987, but some analysts expect the January data to show a modest increase in the gap between exports and imports. This week's trade report will come just ahead of a quarterly `` triple witching hour'' involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. The past couple of witching hours have been relatively uneventful with the adoption of new procedures designed to spread out the impact of last-minute maneuvering by computer program traders. Nevertheless, analysts say uncertainty about how it will go this time has lent an added element of uncertainty to a marketplace still haunted by memories of the crash last fall.

 Oil prices fell sharply Monday in response to reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest producer, had rejected calls for new restrictions on production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for April delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark crude, lost 70 cents to settle at $ 15.59 per 42-gallon barrel.

In addition, officials of non-OPEC producers met last week to discuss similar concerns. `` The Saudis believe that if current quotas are maintained, inventories are going to come down gradually,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Saudis' apparent rejection of new quotas, attributed to officials attending an Arab Energy Conference in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, also dimmed hopes that key members of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel would convene an emergency pricing meeting any time soon. `` Action is going to be taken, but not necessarily the kind that's going to right the world in a week,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. As the mood on prices turned bearish, near-term contracts for refined products also turned downward. Wholesale gasoline for April delivery lost 1.23 cents to 44.36 cents per gallon. Wholesale heating oil fall 1.35 cents to 43.34 cents per gallon. Analysts said the slide in prices was accelerated by technical factors as traders dumped contracts purchased in the midst of the rally late last week. `` Everyone remains very, very nervous and unsure of the -LRB- market's -RRB- direction,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Redoglio </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>.

 Internal documents indicate that <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may have misled doctors and a federal regulatory agency about safety characteristics of its Copper-7 contraceptive, according to an attorney representing a woman who claims the device made her sterile. Wall Street reacted Monday by knocking the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, down $ 3.12 -LCB- a share to $ 83.37 -LCB-. According to the documents, <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> apparently hid complaints about the Copper-7 from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the attorney said. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> task force recommended that a federal grand jury investigate whether any laws were broken by <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s allegedly misleading reports on animal studies for a number of products, including the Copper-7. No charges were filed. The Searle documents, produced for a trial set to start May 16 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, became public last week on order of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>. The judge rejected <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s arguments that the memorandums be kept confidential to protect trade secrets. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> attorney who represent <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, a Melrose woman who claims to have been made infertile by the Copper-7, said: `` These documents can be characterized as the tip of the iceberg. Once all the documents are disclosed -LRB- to the public -RRB-, they will collectively establish without a doubt that the Copper-7 causes -LRB- infection -RRB- and <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew about it, but did not disclose it to doctors or to women.'' Nationally, there have been 17 trials involving <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s Copper-7, 14 of them decided in the company's favor <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s case `` will be the first case tried against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> where the jury will be presented with evidence from <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s files showing what <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew about the hazards of the IUD, when they knew about them and what they did about them _ which was to conceal the information,'' <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, an attorney for <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, said, `` We are confident when a jury hears all the evidence, reviews all the documents and, most importantly, hears from the doctors that they will conclude the Copper-7 is a good IUD that does not cause infection.'' He said that documents not yet released and defense testimony will show that the company did not mislead anyone. A major issue in the suit will be whether the Copper-7 tail string was a single strand of polypropylene incapable of transporting infection-causing bacteria into the uterus, as <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> contends, or if it was made up of many tiny strands that could act as a tunnel for bacteria, as <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> contends. One of the Searle documents quotes a company official saying for the first time that the Copper-7 string is a `` bundle of fused micro-filaments.'' The Copper-7 was a popular intrauterine device from 1974 to 1988, when <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> withdrew it from the market citing litigation costs. Many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women continue to use Copper-7 IUDs and <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> recently resumed manufacturing the device in order to fill foreign orders.

 The dollar turned in a mixed performance against other major currencies Monday as traders bided their time in advance of Thursday's report on the January merchandise trade deficit. Gold prices edged higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 441.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 441.25 an ounce late Friday. Traders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the dollar's immediate future was closely tied to the British pound, which has gained 10 cents against the dollar in the past month. Traders were cautious about the dollar-sterling rate on the eve of Tuesday's British budget statement. Also in the offing were a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Tuesday on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' fourth-quarter balance in the current account, the broadest measure of trade, and Thursday's merchandise trade figures. Currency traders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have largely been reacting to developments overseas in the last two weeks, ever since the big run-up in the British pound, said <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Udagawa </PERSON>, chief trader for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Now it's going to be a calm before the storm, before the trade figures,'' said <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer for the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound edged upward to $ 1.8575 from $ 1.8535 Friday. But later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound finished the trading day at $ 1.8540, down from $ 1.8562 late Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 127.23 Japanese yen, down from 127.80 on Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 126.85 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar sank to 126.79 yen from 127.29 yen late Friday. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.6629 West German marks, up from 1.6602; 1.3717 Swiss francs, up from 1.3696; 1.2572 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2571; 5.6395 French francs, down from 5.6460; and 1,231.25 Italian lire, up from 1,231. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.6645 West German marks, up from 1.6615; 1.3693 Swiss francs, down from 1.3720; 5.6375 French francs, down from 5.6515; 1.8645 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,227.87 Italian lire, down from 1,232.55; and 1.2577 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2553. Gold bullion prices gained about 50 cents in light trading. The late gold price in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> center, was $ 441 a troy ounce bid, up from $ 440.50 late Friday. The late <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> bid price was $ 441.50, up from $ 441.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Skyrocket On Private Firm's Acreage Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices soared as much as 13 -LCB- cents a bushel Monday after a private crop analyst predicted only a slight increase in soybean planting this year. Grain futures also closed higher. On other markets, crude oil futures tumbled well below $ 16 a barrel; livestock and meat futures advanced sharply; precious metals posted slight gains; and stock-index futures advanced. Prices for delivery of new-crop soybeans _ those to be harvested this fall as opposed to those already in storage _ posted the greatest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction talk about estimates issued Monday morning by <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private analytical firm based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Sparks reportedly pegged 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean plantings at 57.5 million acres, just slightly above last year's 57.4 million acres The report followed an estimate of about 60 million acres made last week by <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large commodities trading firm. Earlier trade estimates have been as high as 64 million acres. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will release its first 1988 crop acreage estimates on March 31. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> would not comment on the figures, which it supplies only to its subscribers. `` That's not the gospel, but it's the closest thing we've got for the time being,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the reported <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> estimate. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Luth </PERSON>, Chicago-based soybean analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the Sparks estimate merely gave the soybean market an excuse to reclaim the losses it sustained last week. `` You were oversold, you were in a hole,'' <PERSON> Luth </PERSON> said. `` With an excuse to rally, that's exactly what the market did.'' <PERSON> Luth </PERSON> said he expected 1988 soybean planting to total 58.4 million acres. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> also reportedly predicted 1988 corn plantings at 66.8 million acres compared to last year's 65.7 million. The estimate was seen as slightly bullish for corn prices. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 2.95 \ a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 1.98 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $ 1.90 a bushel; soybeans were 7 -LCB- cents to 13 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 6.14 -RCB- Oil prices fell sharply to below $ 16 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to reports that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest producer, had rejected calls for new restrictions on production. Crude prices had moved above $ 16 late last week after members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> called for a meeting of the cartel's pricing committee to stabilize market prices. Prices for future delivery of refined products also tumbled. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 63 cents to 70 cents lower with April at $ 15.59 cents a barrel; heating oil was 1.30 cents to 1.38 cents lower with April at 43.34 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.23 cents to 1.33 cents lower with April at 44.36 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures posted sharp gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to stronger demand for cattle and tighter supplies of hogs, resulting in higher cash prices for both. Weather worries also helped boost the livestock futures, analysts said. A winter storm moving out of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> could slow the movement of animals to market in the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .70 cent to 1.18 cents higher with April at 74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .38 cent to 1.42 cents higher with March at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 1.50 cents higher with April at 45.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.40 cents to 1.90 cents higher with March at 53.57 cents a pound Silver futures advanced slightly while gold finished nearly unchanged on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled unchanged to 50 cents higher with April at $ 443.10 a troy ounce; silver was 5.9 cents to 6.2 cents higher with March at $ 6.24 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures gained on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .90 point higher at 266.40.

 Oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Monday the petroleum industry will recover soon, but never to the heights reached during its boom days in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parnership </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, said oil should reach at least $ 18 a barrel by the end of the year, far below its highs near $ 40 a barrel in 1982. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> told delegates to the 111th <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Southwestern Cattle Raisers convention that the state needs to continue its trend of economic diversification. `` Sometime, oil production in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wo n't be too important. Taxes from the oil industry are consistently going down,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. `` To believe that the oil industry is going to lead the state of the doldrums we're in I do n't believe it will be the case,'' he said. `` I do believe the industry will get better over a period of time, but it will never be the leader that we had been in the past.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the oil and gas rig count would never reach its peak of nearly 5,000 in 1981. `` I do n't believe in my lifetime that I will see 2,000 rigs operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said that consumers should not fear the long lines at the pumps such as those during the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and 1974. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is going to provide the floor price for you. Just give them a little time and they'll get their act in order and they'll give you an $ 18 floor,'' he said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he opposed an oil import fee because it would spark government control.

<HEAD>First City Optimistic About Closing On Bank Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said Monday he is confident debt holders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will surrender their notes to the bank for less than face value. On March 4, more than 71 percent of the Houston-based bank holding company's 37 million shareholders approved a $ 1.5 billion federal bailout plan. The plan _ which would be the second largest government bank bailout _ calls for $ 970 million in federal assistance, a $ 500 million infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, and a spinoff of $ 1.79 billion in book value of poorly performing assets. First City, the fourth-largest bank firm in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, grew quickly during the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil boom, but was hammered by energy and real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company posted a $ 1.1 billion loss. Under a buyout plan that was made a condition of the bailout, holders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s debt securities would be paid less than the face value of their notes, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, director of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The amounts offered to note holders ranged from 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar, he said. But <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who would head the bank under the plan, told federal regulators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this weekend that not enough of the note holders have agreed to sell at those prices. The agreement provides that 90 percent of the debt holders turn over their notes by a 4 p.m. CST Tuesday deadline. During a Monday afternoon news conference in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> would not say how many debt holders had submitted their notes, but expressed confidence the deal can be closed by month's end. `` There's a high degree of confidence and enthusiasm as presently structured,'' said <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, who was wearing a `` Yes We Can! First City'' button on his lapel. `` I would ask the other debt holders who have not yet tendered to cooperate with us and submit their securities. We're prepared to close if conditions are fully satisfied,'' he added. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> said debt holders are getting more than if the bank were liquidated. `` The offer on the table is basically the offer until Tuesday afternoon,'' he said. `` There is no intent on anybody's part to make any material changes in the monetary terms of the offering.'' Last week, First City bonds were trading well above the prices being offered under the bailout plan. Analysts said this indicated that some investors were gambling that federal regulators would come up with a higher price for the First City debt. The investors are betting that the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, in its eagerness to wrap up the <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> deal, will either sweeten the offer or reduce the percentage of shares that need to be tendered. Still other analysts said last week that the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> could refuse to raise the offer for fear of setting a precedent for future bank bailouts. Other options available to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, the analysts said, include canceling the <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> deal and reopening bidding for the bank, or a move by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to itself take over <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, as it did with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> has assets of $ 11 billion and operates 59 banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker Releases American Standard Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday disclosed previously confidential information received from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that showed the takeover target expected sales and earnings to rise substantially by 1992. American Standard had shared the information as part of its negotiating strategy with <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a tool and appliance company that has been pursuing the plumbing and air conditioning maker since late January. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> has an outstanding offer of $ 73 a share, or $ 2.27 billion, to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>. It was n't clear whether the information would influence <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s next move. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday it was considering other bids from undisclosed suitors, including one worth $ 75 a share or $ 2.35 billion, and gave <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> until Wednesday to make another offer. As quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, the information received from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> included its secret five-year plan with sales and cash flow figures and the basic economic assumptions underlying them. They showed <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> expected sales to rise from $ 3.8 billion this year to more than $ 4.7 billion by the end of 1992, and earnings to double to $ 304 million. Both companies said the disclosure was required by federal securities laws because it could have a bearing on whether <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Decker changed its position in the takeover battle. But securities analysts said it was highly unusual that the information was released. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> is involved in a `` contentious battle,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who follows the company for <PERSON> Legg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` If the information works to discourage another bidder, that works in <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>'s interest,'' he said. If the returns look crummy, it could discourage someone else.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said `` I've never heard of that before. Confidential means confidential where I was brought up. `` If it is not unique, it's nearly unique,'' said <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>. `` We -LRB- analysts -RRB- ca n't even get five-year forecasts.''

<HEAD>British Stock Prices Close Higher Ahead Of Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices closed slightly higher in thin trading Monday in what traders said was cautious optimism ahead of Tuesday's release of the British budget. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 7.9 points at 1,819.5. The index had been up by 9.0 points at mid-afternoon after a Wall Street slightly higher than Friday's close Volume fell to 337.1 million shares from 688.2 million on Friday. Traders said many participants stayed on the sidelines ahead of Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>'s budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday. Economists are forecasting personal tax cuts amounting to 3 billion to 4 billion pounds _ about $ 5.5 billion to $ 7.4 billion at current exxchange rates _ and a fiscal 1989 budget that is balanced or slightly in surplus. Also boosting shares were better-than-expected results from <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, the giant pharmaceuticals concern, traders said. <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> announced its pre-tax profit rose 5.6 percent to 397 million pounds in the six months ended Dec. 31, exceeding market expectations. <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> finished up 27 pence at 10.82 pounds a share.

<HEAD>Media General Again Spurns Sugarman Bid, Files Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspaper and television station operator <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it sued unwanted suitor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, the Los Angeles-based investor and TV producer, accusing him of making statements designed to create speculation in Media General's stock. The suit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where Media General is based, seeks an injunction barring <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> from such actions and requiring <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> to sell the 10 percent of the company's stock he has acquired. The suit also seeks unspecified monetary damages. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> said its board had `` carefully considered'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>'s $ 61.50 per share, or $ 1.58 billion, offer for the 90 percent of the company he does n't already own and decided not to pursue it. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> was out of the office and not available for comment, a receptionist said. The suit accuses <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> of making `` inaccurate and incomplete'' statements to the press and in <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filings ` designed to create speculation concerning <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> stock and to help him in a possible proxy contest.'' The suit also claims <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> has, in effect, begun seeking proxies through his statements in the press without filing required <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> documents in advance. Media General's stock closed Monday at $ 47.25, down 37 -LCB- cents. The suit is the latest salvo in two-week-old tug of war between <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and the family of Media General's chairman, <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, which controls a majority of the company's voting power. If <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> succeeds in putting his proposal before shareholders, the company said, the <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> family will vote against it. The <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> family owns 71 percent of the company's Class B common stock. Although there are only 559,168 Class B shares, they have the voting power to elect seven of the company's 10 directors. Media General has 28 million Class A shares, which have one vote each and elect three directors. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>, who owns 10 percent of the company's Class A stock and none of the Class B, has argued that the disproportionate voting rule does n't apply if a holder of more than 10 percent of the company's stock proposes a merger. Media General says its counsel disagrees. Media General, based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, owns a number of daily newspapers, including the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times-Dispatch and News Leader, the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal and the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, plus 32 weeklies in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a 40 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that owns 18 dailies and four weeklies in eight states. It also owns television stations, including WCBD-TV in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, WJKS-TV in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and WXFL-TV in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> is making the takeover offer through two companies he controls _ <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of successful televison programs such as `` The Dating Game'' and `` The Gong Show,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday agreed to a sweetened friendly merger with <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which upped its initial bid by $ 200 million in cash to $ 6.3 billion, giving it an edge over hostile competitor <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Under terms of the amended merger agreement unanimously approved by the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> will offer $ 77.35 a share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock, up from $ 74.50 per share for the same portion in its original offer. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> plans to swap shares in a new company _ <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> - </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ and issue convertible debt securities for the remaining 20 percent of The offer expires on April 4. Meanwhile, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> indicated it had no immediate intention of revising its rival bid. The company late Monday extended its $ 6.18 billion tender offer through Friday in advance of a court hearing over suits filed by both sides to challenge each other's bids. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> indicated at the lengthy evening hearing that he would not rule before Wednesday either on <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> request to force <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to extend its tender offer past Friday or on <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense. Sand said he was seeking an opinion from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s latest tender offer _ which was revised from a previous, lower bid _ constitutes a brand-new offer that must remain open past its scheduled expiration. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> hopes that by forcing <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to extend its offer it will ease the pressure on <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stockholders to accept the Canadian company's bid. The judge said he would not get the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> opinion before Wednesday and would not rule on either suit before then. However, Sand stated that both buyout offers would have to remain in effect for at least three business days after he ruled on the poison pill issue, effectively extending <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer through next week. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock closed unchanged at $ 66 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In consideration for the sweetened offer from <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> a `` lockup'' option to purchase its <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s - <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s Wilshire and <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> retail divisions if the merger is <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said the divisions would sell for at least $ 800 million and $ 150 million, respectively. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has valued those divisions at a total of about $ 1.25 billion. Additionally, <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s board `` sole discretion'' over whether to maintain its `` poison pill,'' or shareholder-rights plan, which makes unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive. Under its previous agreement, Cincinnati-based <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would have rescinded the plan in a merger with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>. In recommending shareholders tender their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> called the new offer `` substantially more favorable to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stockholders than <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s previous offer and the coercive <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> two-tier offer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> on Monday extended its hostile offer to buy 70.5 million of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock, or 80 percent, at $ 75 a share from Tuesday until Friday to take pressure off the federal judge who was to preside over the courtroom battle. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said the remaining 20 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock would be acquired later for $ 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger, giving the deal an aggregate value of $ 68 per share. Shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s move was announced, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> urged its shareholders to hold onto their stock, reversing an unusual recommendation issued Sunday, when <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> `` reluctantly'' advised shareholders to tender their shares. Although <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is opposed to merging with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, the retailer intended to make sure its shareholders got the higher price offered in the first stage of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s two-tier buyout bid. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said later Monday that its board again might advise shareholders to tender to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> `` to avoid the risk of being relegated'' to the $ 44-a-share `` backend.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> were to succeed in its bid, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> vowed to go to court, and urged shareholders to do the same rather than `` accepting the grossly inadequate price which <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has proposed for its backend merger.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> owns department store chains including <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has indicated that if successful in acquiring <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> it planned to sell <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s to <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 1.5 billion. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> has nearly 100 department and specialty stores, while <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to obtain all the necessary financing to complete its buyout by the March 18 expiration date, but <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> repeatedly has challenged that claim

 A <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> advertisement designed to catch readers' attention has caught some flak from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Consumer Affairs Department. The department said Monday it had cited the airline for a March 10 ad in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that it claims gave the false impression that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was involved with the airline's promotion. The ad in question stated: `` Fly <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to be out of the country on April 15 and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> will allow you an automatic filing extension.'' <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aponte </PERSON>, commissioner of Consumer Affairs, said the ad falsely implied a sponsorship by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and falsely asserted that consumers must leave the country in order to get the automatic extension to file. <PERSON> Aponte </PERSON> also said the ad failed to give important information concerning the filing of extensions. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters, said an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> official indicated last week there were no problems with the ad and that it was straightforward and accurate. `` We're mostly very puzzled that the department would insinuate itself into an issue where there is no argument,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has stated that it has no problems whatsoever with the advertisement.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the consumer affairs department, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was cited Friday and sent a notice via overnight mail to its headquarters. Continental was directed to send a representative to the department on March 25 and pay fines of up to $ 500 for each violation. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said no one at the airline's headquarters had seen the notice, but the airline's representatives would attempt to clear up the issue with the consumer affairs department.
