 Fire gutted a packed <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> social club Sunday afternoon, killing seven people and injuring more than 30, and firefighters' efforts were hampered by screaming people trying to get to relatives, authorities said. `` It was sheer panic,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>. The inside of the basement club was burned out and `` it looked like people tried to claw out all of the walls,'' he said. Fire marshals were testing for the presence of flammable liquids, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Fire Department. The origin was considered suspicious because of the fire spread so quickly, he said. The streets were filled with screaming people who tried to pull equipment from firefighters and get to their friends, <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> said. `` There were people running around crazy ...,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisonas </PERSON>. `` When we went to go do our job, people were trying to fight the tools away from us. It was crazy. They wanted to pull us one way and then another way trying to get us to the people trapped in the basement.'' Firefighters said five bodies were found in the club, some still in chairs. Another person died shortly after the fire at a hospital and the seventh died about eight hours later at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman said. Most of the injured, including six firefighters and two <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> technicians, were suffering from smoke inhalation and were taken to hospitals. <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> described the club as about 50 feet by 75 feet with 7-foot ceilings. Between 60 and 100 people were packed inside. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who toured the blaze aftermath, described the club as a `` rabbit warren.'' `` If people were running for their lives, they'd run down blind alleys and be trapped,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who described the space as confined and made up of small, partitioned cubicles. `` It's clear that it should have never been opened in the first place,'' he said of the club. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a deputy fire chief, said the private bar known to neighbors as `` the hole'' was illegal because bars in basements are prohibited and the exits were inadequate. A resident of the area, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Govia </PERSON>, 25, said the club operated 24 hours a day. `` Police often raided the place,'' he said. Authorities said they have trouble keeping illegal clubs closed because there are hundreds in the city. The fire was reported about 12:30 p.m. and firefighters were `` met by hysterical civilians streaming up the staircase,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. `` One firefighter told me he literally had to fight his way down the stairs,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Most escaped through the club's front door and narrow staircase, but others were able to break through a wall near the back. A second door on the side of the club was locked, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. Eighteen engine companies, nine ladder units and about 150 firefighters brought the five-alarm blaze under control about 3:15 p.m., <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abakr </PERSON> <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> removes his shoes before wading through the knee-deep fetid water left behind by the worst rains on record in this desert capital. Each step across what used to be a dusty dirt road unleashes an overpowering stench. The vast expanse of water is contaminated with excrement from overflowing pit latrines and from dogs, goats and donkeys living in the village. <PERSON> Idris </PERSON>' village of <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, a shantytown of about 50,000 on <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s southeastern fringe, was among the areas hardest hit by the deluge Aug. 4-5. `` We are struggling with life here now,'' said <PERSON> Idris </PERSON>, 48. `` We are without water, without food, without homes, without transport, without anything.'' The storm dumped 8.4 inches of rain in 14 hours, six times the amount that fell in all of 1987. For the past 30 years, annual rainfall has not exceeded 4.3 inches. At least 58 people died, most as their mud huts collapsed on them. Up to 1.5 million people _ more than a third of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s nearly 4 million inhabitants _ were left homeless and more than 150,000 dwellings were destroyed, according to government figures Most vulnerable were the people living in <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> and 22 other squatter camps around <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The illegal settlements hold 500,000 to 700,000 people who fled <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southern civil war and widespread drought. The vast camps of mud huts and burlap-covered shacks are desperately poor and occupy the worst land. The Moslem-dominated government, at war with the Christian and animist south, long has tried to discourage further settlement in the squatter areas. It denies the areas any social services and forbids the displaced people living there from digging wells. Official neglect threatened to leave most of the displaced people beyond the reach of international relief after the storm. The government initially refused aid but ultimately relented in the face of the sheer magnitude of the disaster and the threat of epidemics sweeping from the camps. Many relief workers still worry the unplanned areas will receive less than their fair share of government aid. `` There will be a natural built-in bias towards planned areas,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wannop </PERSON>, resident representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> development program which is helping coordinate non-government relief. Emergency aid has yet to reach most of those affected by the flood, many of whom live in areas isolated by stagnant lakes which have nowhere to drain. Nearly all the mud huts in <LOCATION> Marzuk </LOCATION>, an unplanned area of about 15,000 people in <LOCATION> Omdurman </LOCATION> across the Nile river from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, were destroyed or damaged by the rains. The people said they needed plastic sheeting and tents. `` They are very important because the children now are sleeping outside,'' said <PERSON> Abdullahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kody </PERSON>, a resident. `` Once I had two rooms,'' <PERSON> Kody </PERSON> said, pointing to a mound of hardening mud. `` Unfortunately, they have fallen down.'' <PERSON> Kody </PERSON>, <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> and others interviewed nearly two weeks after the disaster said they received no help from anyone and were desperately in need of food, shelter, and medicine. Health officials are predicitng deadly epidemics of water-borne diseases as people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced to drink from the pools left behind by the rainstorm. Thousands already have developed diarrhea. Malaria and typhoid also are on the rise, and cholera is an imminent risk. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a world health organization expert on diarrheal diseases an immunization, predicted 400,000 people, mostly children, will get sick and at least 4,000 will die. Without treatment, as many as 40,000 will perish, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> estimated. But he said emergency health clinics established in response to the disaster should forestall the worst. Diarrhea kills the young and the weak primarily through dehydration and is treatable with a simple rehydrating mixture of salt, sugar and water. But lack of fresh water supplies make even this basic therapy difficult. Sudanese authorities blame insufficient supplies for delays in granting relief. More than 2,000 tons of tents, blankets, medicine, plastic sheeting, food and other items have poured into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but officials have said it is about a tenth of what is needed. Disorganization and the dilapidated infrastructure of this North African nation of 23 million also have hampererd the relief operation. The rains knocked out telephones, disrupting coordination between the army-run operation and non-governmental agencies. The downpour also created mud bogs of roads already strewn with potholes from years of neglect. Another threat comes from the swollen <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION>, which already has swamped some island villages and is brimming near street level in the capital. Officials are not sure when or whether the river might overflow into the city. A pair of British cartographers working with government surveyors has begun work on a contour map which will help determine how much higher the Nile would have to rise before spilling into <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s streets. In the meantime, relief efforts will continue. And people like <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Geragandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koko </PERSON>, who lives in a settlement built on a garbage pile in north <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, will do what they must to find food and shelter. `` Previously there was drought and we got through that,'' he said. `` We hope to get through this too.''

 Two American activists who addressed a student rally last week were arrested and ordered expelled for taking part in radical political meetings, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said today. The two were identified as <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 31, a secretary in the history department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON>, 37, a <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, computer salesman. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular officer said Ms. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON> were arrested late Saturday leaving a meeting with other activitists. Both had tourist visas that prohibited them from any political activity, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The two were held overnight by <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Immigration authorities and ordered to leave the country `` for activities inconsistent with their visa status.'' There were no available flights Sunday, so <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the two spent Sunday night at the airport and would leave today. Both Ms. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON> spoke to a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 15 for some 3,000 students assembled to march to the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for talks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula.

<DATELINE>SANTA MARIA DEL ORO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration law went into effect last year, this town in <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> cattle country 500 miles south of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, feared for its future. For nearly half a century, it had supplied Mexicans who worked legally or illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sent home the dollars that helped keep the town going. But the catastrophe <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oro </ORGANIZATION> braced for 14 months ago has n't happened. Thousands of dollars still pour in every day, in money orders sent by residents' relatives working, most of them illegally, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> had feared the flow of dollars would dry up and, worse, hundreds of young men would come home looking for jobs that do n't exist. `` We would have seen at least some economic affects of the law by now, but everything is totally normal,'' <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> says now. `` The dollar continues being the most important source of income in this region,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, assistant manager of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internacional </ORGANIZATION>, the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar checks. `` Some people returned because of fear before they knew what was going to happen with the law. But now things are back to normal.'' One young man in town said, however, he's waiting to see what happens with the law _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Immigration Control and Reform Act _ before he attempts his first crossing. `` If it were n't for the law I'd already be in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, 18, who just graduated from a technical school here. He said two of his brothers already there had applied for amnesty under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law and fear they'll lose out if they harbor him as an illegal alien. `` If my brothers will let me, I'll go in spite of the law,'' said <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>. `` Here you work so hard and you do n't make much.'' <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Oro </PERSON> has supplied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor market with a steady stream of workers since World War II. Many residents went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as farm workers under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bracero program of 1942, said Mayor <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON>. By now, some have gained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship or legal residency. By the time the program was dropped in 1964, many local residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning dollars. Besides, said <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON>, the local gold and mining operations were winding down and there was n't much left to do here but work in the fields or raise cattle. The only major employer around these days is a lumber company, which has about 300 workers. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, the municipal clerk, estimates that more than 30 percent of the town's 14,000 people still go back and forth to jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding farms and ranches with relatives working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is as high or even higher. <PERSON> Carreon </PERSON> said the steady flow of dollars _ as much as $ 60,000 a week _ has helped <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oro </LOCATION> weather <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 6-year-old economic crisis. Indeed, by Mexican standards <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Oro </PERSON> is well off. The main streets are filled with late-model <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican pickup trucks, many bearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license plates. There are no beggars on the streets. Many of the homes and businesses were financed with dollars. Residents and public officials here say the law has helped those who hve been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a long time and wanted to stay there. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> returned several years ago and bought a butcher shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. His brother, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> butcher, stayed and has applied for amnesty, the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet certain requirements to seek legal residency. `` He feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house -LRB- in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB- he'll return,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. Illegal aliens caught in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> most often are deported immediately. For others who did n't qualify for amnesty under the law or just did n't bother to apply, it's business as usual: a sundown trek across the border. `` We'll stay as long as there's work. When there's not we'll come back crying,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 29, who has worked in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an undocumented worker for a decade `` Right now the work is there waiting for us,'' said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, one of three brothers working without documents at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> construction company. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, home on vacation, said the $ 21 an hour he earns makes the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile. Similar work in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> probably would pay him about $ 12 a day. `` Right now it -LRB- the law -RRB- has n't affected us at all,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' 18-year-old brother who began working illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when he was 14. The toughest provision of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law went into effect this past June 1, making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire undocumented workers. The law calls for stiff fines and even jail sentences for violators. Agricultural workers now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been given an extension to Dec. 1 to get their papers in order or leave. Although crossing the border without legal documents is the risky part, those who've worked in the same job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since before 1982 do n't have to show employers their documents.

 As the smoke clears in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with a U.N.-sponsored truce, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are counting the cost of a conflict that killed an estimated 1 million people but ended with no victor. Peace talks scheduled to start Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are likely to be long and tough. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are ancient enemies, and eight years of war have only deepened old hatreds. Both countries, bled by the war, face mammoth tasks in rebuilding their economies despite the oil wealth they used to bankroll their military machines. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also faces the prospect of political turmoil as hardliners such as Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, a vociferous critic of `` defeatist'' diplomatic efforts to end the war; and more pragmatic leaders, particularly Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, battle for supremacy. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is widely seen as the man who engineered <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s unconditional acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution last month when he realized <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military machine was weakening after a string of battlefield defeats this year. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s decision, widely seen as the speaker's biggest political gamble, although the ailing patriarch stressed that for him, ending the war was `` worse than drinking poison.'' So far, no senior <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader has publicly challenged that decision, which most Iranians have welcomed after eight years of appalling human loss. But <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also has made clear he seeks to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation, faces an increasingly strong array of radicals led by <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> and the prosecutor-general, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoeinihia </PERSON>, leader of the militants who seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in November 1979, who oppose his pragmatist policies They consider his efforts to end a war he clearly believed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could never win flies in the face of the revolution's aim of spreading Islamic fundamentalism. Analysts say the internal struggle for supremacy after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, which has been swelling over the last two years as the patriarch's health deteriorated, has only been intensified by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the On the ground, the two belligerents wound up virtually where they started in September 1980, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the map unchanged after one of the longest conventional wars this century. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, whose 1980 invasion is seen by military analysts a major blunder, has emerged at least for now more solidly entrenched in power in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which spent as much as $ 10 billion a year on its war effort, is as much as $ 85 billion in debt, according to Western economists. That makes it one of the world's biggest debtor nations. The war cost <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> an estimated $ 400 billion. Although it still has about $ 5 billion in foreign reserves, its economy is in tatters, its industry, particularly its oil installations, pounded by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s powerful air force. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, whose hatred of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> turned the war into a bloody vendetta, remains the unchallenged authority in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But his surprise decision last month to accept the cease-fire, despite his exhortations to `` fight to the last drop of blood'' to topple the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader, has dented the 88-year-old religious patriarch's credibility. The Iraqis, armed with superior weaponry and technology, won something simply by surviving <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s human-wave offensives and wearing down the numerically superior Iranians, although <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used outlawed chemical weapons and hammered <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> cities with bombers and missiles. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, virtually friendless and starved of the arsenal of high-tech weaponry the Iraqis employed, can claim that it repelled the invaders and fought them to a standstill. The war undoubtedly helped cement <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution. Opponents of the cleric-dominated <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> regime charge that the fundamentalists deliberately perpetuated the conflict to consolidate the infant republic and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s stern brand of Islam. With an end to the war now a possibility, the Arab countries of the oil-rich gulf who were caught in the crossfire, and the rest of the Moslem world, are heaving a collective sigh of relief. But an end to the war will have strategic repercussions far beyond the gulf. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fears that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has participated to some extent in every Arab-Israeli war over the last four decades, eventually will turn its combat-hardened military machine again on the Jewish state. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said last month that although he did not see any danger of an imminent <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attack, the military buildup by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states spawned by the gulf war could be used against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. With the gulf war out of the way, the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states are expected to refocus their attention on efforts to solve the older <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. If <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his supporters, such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, succeed in out-maneuvering their hard-line opponents in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with the West are likely to improve. That, in turn, has raised hopes that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can be persuaded to use its influence with pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to free foreign hostages, including nine Americans.

<TEXT>
 Five years after dissident leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was killed, the slaying remains unsolved and his goal of a peaceful, stable democracy unfulfilled in the turbulent country now governed by his widow. On Aug. 21, 1983, the senator stepped from a <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and into Philippine history, gunned down moments after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for leadership of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The killing outraged the nation and emboldened a fragmented opposition, paving the way for the uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency on Feb. 25, 1986. Now, statues of `` Ninoy,'' the senator's nickname, stand in major cities, and the airport where he died bears his name. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said repeatedly that if it were not for his death, she never would have risen to power. But the trial of 40 defendants charged in the assassination drags on nearly 16 months after it began, bogged down in a complex legal system. In September 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voided acquittals handed down by a Marcos-era tribunal and ordered a retrial. The slow pace of the trial typifies the unfinished agenda of an administration made possible by the Aquino slaying. The political turbulence that made such a killing possible haunts the country. For many, the lofty hopes that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ouster alone would restore stability and prosperity have given way to frustration. `` Five years after <PERSON> Ninoy </PERSON>'s death, the <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> government has become the government it warned us against,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiros </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, a frequent critic of the administration. Critics in the freewheeling <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> press often ignore Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s accomplishments, preferring instead to hold her to the idealistic promises of justice, domestic peace and social reform she espoused. Despite the insurgency and right-wing coup plots, her administration drafted a new constitution, restored a bicameral legislature and held national and regional elections in its first two years. The administration reversed three years of economic decline and posted a 5.5 percent growth in the gross national product in its first full year. But for millions of Filipinos, more than 60 percent of whom live in poverty, the slow pace of change has done little to improve their daily lives. Inflation in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area, triggered by increases in prices of food and fuel, is approaching 10 percent. Allegations of continuing corruption have been raised not only by the press but by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, the country's best known cleric and an Aquino supporter. Communist rebels still wield power in rural areas, and urban guerrillas have escalated street assassinations in the capital itself. Right-wing `` death squads'' have retaliated with their own attacks against labor activists and suspected leftists. `` If the principal element of -LRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s -RRB- death was violence, it is only fitting that the people who were shocked by the incident and who felt sorry for the late senator should now shun violence and work to strengthen the rule of law,'' said The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Bulletin in an editorial Sunday. `` Violence still stalks the land, because many do not respect the rule of law.'' Growing disaffection prompted Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> this month to accuse the administration of incompetence, failing to stem the rebellion and tolerating corruption on the scale of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Laurel called on Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to resign and call new elections. Although Laurel's allegations were similar to those of some of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s supporters, his charges won little public support, mostly because of the vice president's reputation as a political opportunist. `` But if -LRB- Laurel's -RRB- purpose was to jolt <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into waking up from her dream presidency and facing the nightmare it has become for the Filipino people, then it certainly deserves a fair and just assessment,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mata </PERSON> in The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s strongest supporters frequently dismiss criticism as attempts by her opponents to undermine her government. Pro-Aquino columnists claim the latest round of criticism is part of a right-wing plot to tarnish her reputation among the public. `` Under the Aquino regime, blame is immediately being heaped on faceless, nameless people who are ` out to destabilize the government,''' wrote columnist <PERSON> Ninez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacho-Olivarez </PERSON> in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. `` It is the insecure and paranoid who see goblins at every turn.'' Meanwhile, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> herself has become more isolated from the Philippine press. She rarely gives press conferences or interviews. Recently, the presidential palace banned `` ambush interviews,'' where reporters would shout questions at the president as she walked to her office every morning.

 A strong earthquake hit the Himalayan kingdom of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and parts of eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Sunday morning, triggering landslides and collapsing buildings. First reports said 100 people may have died. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geology </ORGANIZATION> said the earthquake struck at 4:54 a.m. -LRB- 7:09 p.m. EDT Saturday -RRB- and measured 5.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The department said the quake was centered near <LOCATION> Udayapur </LOCATION>, a town near the Indian-Nepalese border and 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s capital. Officials said the temblor lasted about 40 seconds. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Seismologoical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> said the quake measured 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nepal </ORGANIZATION> said at least 27 people were killed in the towns of <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> when they were buried by collapsing houses. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that in addition to 100 feared dead in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, 1,000 people were injured in the Indian states of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sikkim </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. A Nepalese journalist in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION>, 130 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, said by telephone that `` 20 people have already died. A large number of injured were being taken to local hospitals and a rescue operation is under way. Men of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nepal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, police, social workers and other local inhabitants are taking part in the rescue operation.'' The journalist added that `` 90 percent of the house of <LOCATION> Vijapur </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> collapsed.'' Police reported seven people died in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, an ancient town seven miles east of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, while 20 others suffered injuries. The quake was also felt in the Indian capital of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, but there was no report of any casualties. One hard-hit Indian city was <LOCATION> Dharbhanga </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, where 14 children were believed killed when their school hostel collapsed. Dharbhanga, with a population of 200,000, is 550 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Several homes in the residential areas of <LOCATION> Dharbhanga </LOCATION> have collapsed, killing an unspecified number of people. The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated areas while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

 A strong earthquake triggered landslides and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said. Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the Himalayan region since 1950. More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the eastern Indian state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, officials said. In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, authorities said at least 137 people were dead. Officials in both countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received reports from remote areas which were hit harder. `` The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' said V.K. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, deputy secretary in the <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> government. The temblor also jolted parts of northern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and people roused from their sleep ran screaming from their homes as objects tumbled from shelves and tables. `` My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. <PERSON> Rudra </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> capital. `` My dogs began barking and I rushed out of the house.'' At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered landslides and house collapses in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and the surrounding states of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION>, all heavily populated, largely agricultural areas. The quake also was felt in <LOCATION> Sikkim </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>, located in the <LOCATION> Himalayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> foothills </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Upadhyaya </PERSON>, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of houses collapsed from the quake's impact. `` Most of them -LRB- were -RRB- buried alive under collapsed houses,'' said <PERSON> Indra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON>, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bazar </LOCATION>, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border. <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON> said rescue operations were being hampered by the monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September. Both countries were rushing emergency medical teams to the area. The Red Cross of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> issued urgent appeals for blood donations. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, communications with <PERSON> Darbhanga </PERSON>, which appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted. The <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at least 17 children. It said more bodies were feared buried under the debris. The quake damaged most of the houses in <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION>, the news agency said, quoting P.K. <PERSON> Patnaik </PERSON>, the top civil administrator in the district. Deaths were also reported in the neighboring towns of <PERSON> Munger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keoti </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Narpatnagar </LOCATION>. The tremor also was felt in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. There were no immediate reports of casualties but residents were quoted as saying windows of several homes vibrated and doors rattled. The <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said the quake hit at 4:40 a.m. -LRB- 7:10 p.m. EDT Saturday -RRB- and was centered 40 to 50 miles northeast of the town of <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state, along the India-Nepal border. Observatory Director H.N. <PERSON> Srivastava </PERSON> said the quake measured 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. <PERSON> Srivastava </PERSON> said the quake lasted about one minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour. Seismologists warned aftershocks could continue for days. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> said its initial seismograph readings placed the center of the quake 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Geological Survey monitors in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, recorded the earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage. Earthquakes are common in the Himalayan region. On Aug. 6 a quake of magnitude 7.3 shook the states of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manipur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>. Four people were killed. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst earthquake was in 1950, when at least 30,000 people were killed in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state.

<HEAD>Midways Open in Heat and Drought with Reeling Livestock, Melting
Ice Cream</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reeling livestock, sizzling sidewalks, ice cream through a straw _ these are a few of the added detractions at <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> state fairs in a summer of killing heat and devastating drought. The fairs still feature Ferris wheels and funhouses, midway crowds of farmers in coveralls, girls in summer dresses, swarms of eager kids _ and traditional summer fare like corn on the cob, butterfly porkchop sandwiches, cotton candy and snow cones. But it's not the same. `` You do n't feel like eating,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 66, of <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` You want something, but you do n't.'' `` And the ice cream melts so fast,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Vi </PERSON>. The parched, hot summer that has turned city lawns brown and urbanites crabby has been a disaster for the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, where growers grimly contemplate shriveled fields in autumn colors and deep cuts in projected grain harvests. At the fairgrounds, it makes for smaller produce and livestock _ and even some casualties. On Tuesday, when the temperature hit 102 degrees in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, `` there were four fatals in the poultry division, and they were chickens,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. The owners, he noted, had left their entries in cars `` with the windows rolled up.'' By Thursday, five rabbits, two hogs and eight chickens died from the 97-degree heat, and livestock exhibitors were taking extra precautions to keep their animals comfortable in fairground barns. `` They're packing some down with ice, they're putting ice in front of fans to blow cool air,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. `` They're coming up with some ingenious ways to handle the heat stress.'' Although state fairs in the heartland traditionally draw millions of people each year, attendance is down somewhat this summer in some states. Fairgoers cheer or challenge in contests ranging from horse-racing to horseshoes, from husband-calling to hog-calling. They relax with rock music and symphonies; they scrutinize blue-ribbon displays of produce or livestock or home crafts; they ride the rides or line up to try the midway games of skill for pink pandas or funny hats; they inspect displays of new farm machinery. Some forget their troubles _ for the moment. `` It is a time that you can just go and forget all about the corn ... or other headaches that you have,'' said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON>, manager of a company that grows seed corn. Trimble plays drums and his farmer father, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON>, plays trumpet with a band of strolling players _ in clown gear _ at the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> fairgrounds every year. `` People kind of want to get away from the farm. It's been a tough year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, board president for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> fair. At the 18-day <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, which drew 3.5 million last year, attendance was down 7 percent for the first 12 days. Free tickets went out to some drought-stricken farmers to squelch rumors of cancellation. Missouri State Fair director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> said rain would help the state reach its goal of 350,000 visitors to the 11-day fair that ends Aug. 28 at <LOCATION> Sedalia </LOCATION> _ with air-conditioning for indoor activities. Relentless hot weather `` could hurt us, but it always seems to rain during the fair,'' <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> said. Officials of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Fair, which begins its 140th run Friday, said entries were down only slightly. `` We've set aside an area with a large tent and nice cool water and lemonade,'' said fair manager <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>. `` It will be a little oasis.'' Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> were optimistic about attendance as the fair began its 11-day run Thursday. <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, working in 104-degree heat Wednesday to prepare the fairgrounds, said that while this summer was `` a little bit extreme, I do n't remember setting up ... and not being covered with sweat.'' Spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> recalled a 108-degree reading at <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s 1983 fair The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> State Fair, which ended Aug. 14 at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allis </LOCATION>, drew 821,819 people _ down nearly 6 percent from last year. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> State Fair, which began Thursday, has 14 acres of air-conditioned space, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who predicted that teen-agers would be outdoors on the midway, whatever the weather. `` I do n't think they know how hot it is,'' she said. `` We wo n't tell them that. The too-hot, too-dry growing season was a disappointment for some produce exhibitors, who ruefully displayed unusually small contenders. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Misich </PERSON> of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said the potatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions are the smallest from his garden he's shown in 10 years at the fair. `` This is sure disappointing _ you're not a-kiddin','' he said. Flowers also suffered. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, dahlia entries were down 50 percent, said fair spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. `` Those flowers were not out there blooming,'' she said. `` We did have a lot of ribbons left over.''

 A Mercedes packed with explosives blew up Sunday near a Syrian army checkpoint in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, wounding 18 people and damaging cars and buildings, police said. No group immediately claimed of responsibility for the bombing in the seaside <LOCATION> Raouche </LOCATION> district, which came during a confrontation between pro-Syrian forces and hard-line pro-Israel Christians over the election of a new president. The cream-colored Mercedes, packed with an estimated 88 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, detonated at 8:40 a.m. only six feet from the checkpoint opposite a fish restaurant, police said. It was not known whether the bomb was detonated by remote control or a timing device. Police said three Syrian soldiers at the sandbagged checkpoint were among the casualties. Most of the other wounded were Lebanese civilians, including women and children. At least eight cars parked nearby were destroyed. The restaurant's glass front was blown in and windows in several neighboring buildings were shattered. Hours later, police said another car rigged with two rockets was safely defused in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> district. The car was parked in front of a bakery about 50 yards from a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> checkpoint. Police said the 107mm rockets were equipped with a timing device but did not say when they were set to go off. Police said the Merecedes that exploded was parked Saturday evening near the restaurant, atop a cliff overlooking the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on a winding hilltop road popular with morning strollers. Several unexploded hand grenades and a mortar shell were found in the wreckage of the car, police said. `` Had they exploded, it would have been a real disaster,'' said a police officer at the scene who spoke on condition of anonymity. Nervous Syrian troops armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles sealed off the blast scene, firing in the air to make room for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> ambulances rushing victims to hospitals. Glass shards from the Mayfair Casino and a string of oceanside fish restaurants littered a radius of 150 yards around the blast scene. `` I heard a powerful explosion that hurled me several meters. Pieces of glass rained on me,'' said a 28-year-old casino employee who declined to be named. The car bombing was the 11th in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 103 people have been killed and 353 wounded in the 10 previous car bombings. The attacks have been a byproduct of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives since it broke out in 1975. Fears of of a new outbreak of violence have been fueled by a presidential election deadlock that threatens to create a power vacuum after President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term in office expires Sept. 23. Christian hardliners backed by the Lebanese Forces, the nation's main civil war militia, prevented the election of Syrian-backed warlord <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> Thursday by boycotting the election session in parliament, blocking a quorum for a vote

<TEXT>
 While the Republicans almost certainly will be blessed with a buoyant economy through Election Day, inflation and rising interest rates could shove the country into a recession as early as next spring, some economists are warning. A few analysts are forecasting a downturn for next year, and many who are n't say it will take luck to avoid a recession. Ironically, one of the things that has them worried is that economic growth has been so robust lately. A boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales has helped push the nation's unemployment rate down to 14-year lows The gross national product has expanded at an annual rate of 3.1 percent during the first six months of the year and there are indications that the economy may be growing even faster in the current July-September quarter. This rapid growth in demand is beginning to push up against supply restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating rates in many industries. This often translates into rising inflationary pressures as workers demand higher wages and businesses boost product prices. To nip inflation before it gets out of hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> since late March has been pushing up interest rates to dampen demand. Earlier this month, it boosted its discount rate one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. An increase in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send of its inflation-fighting intentions. That is what worries economists. Most recessions in this country are brought on by a credit squeeze. While the central bank does n't set out to create a downturn, it often finds it difficult to walk the fine line between dampening demand to cool inflationary pressures and tightening so much that a new recession is triggered `` The famous soft-landing for the economy has proven very difficult to manage in the past,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> said he believed the current expansion, now in its peacetime record 69th month, will head into a new slump by the end of next year. Economists at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> said in their latest forecast that growth could stall by next summer as higher interest rates and a loss of export momentum take their toll. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said next spring will be the beginning of the danger time for the economy, given the six to nine month lag between increases in interest rates and their greatest impact on borrowing. `` We are forecasting that we will be able to avoid a recession next year and just have a slowdown, but the risk of a recession is certainly there if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> gets carried away with tightening,'' he said. Under some optimistic scenarios, the expansion will moderate as higher interest rates cut into consumer and business demand, but strong export sales will provide a boost to manufacturing and prevent a recession. Another theory sees inflation rising at a faster clip, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to take stronger action which will send such key interest-rate sensitive sectors as housing into a tailspin, with the weakness then spreading to the rest of the economy. With mortgage rates climbing lately, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> has already complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit tightening threatened to make the housing industry a `` sacrificial lamb.'' While the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration expressed its disappointment at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s recent discount rate hike, economists said the credit tightening so far should not cause any appreciable slowdown before the Nov. 8 election, good news for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who hopes continued signs of prosperity will translate into votes. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he believed interest rates would keep rising until next February, when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would reverse course after seeing signs that its tightening was having the desired effect of slowing GNP growth. `` We have a fairly rosey scenario in which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> lucks out,'' he said. Economists who are not ready to write the obituary for the expansion say the current recovery from the 1981-82 downturn has proven remarkably resilient and may have a couple of more years of life. `` This expansion has had nine lives,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has rebounded from a flood of imports in the mid-1980s, high real interest rates and the loss of $ 1 trillion of wealth during the 1987 stock market collapse.''

<HEAD>Third World Needs $90 Billion for Roads, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Third World countries need $ 43 billion worth of repairs to their roads, including many of their key thoroughfares, because over the last decade they failed to spend $ 12 billion or less to maintain them, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> says in a report. The largest sum _ $ 11 billion _ is needed in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, followed by $ 9.3 billion in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and another $ 9.3 billion in the poorer countries of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The bank's experts said they were talking about a third of all paved roads outside of towns and a quarter of the unpaved roads in 85 countries. They found that 40 percent of the paved roads will need repair in the next 10 years, at a cost of another $ 40 billion. In 1984, the most recent year for which the report gives figures, the countries concerned put out $ 6.5 billion for repair and maintenance. `` But if these countries do not improve the management of roads, the eventual cost of restoration could easily increase two - to threefold, and the cost to users could rise even more,'' the report warned <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest single source of loans to help poor countries raise their living standards. It has lent about $ 15.5 billion for roads since it was founded at the end of World War II. Routine maintenance can cost as little as $ 480 a mile, while rebuilding can cost more than $ 480,000 a mile, the report said. The experts found the hard core of the problem in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They took 61 Third World countries all over the world and found that 16 of them had budgets too small to pay for the roads they need. Of those 16, there were 11 where citizens' incomes have been declining. Nine of the 11 are south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. They found a different problem in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Many of their roads were built long ago in ways that do not suit today's traffic, and should simply be replaced, the report said.

 It's beginning to look like a daily habit _ a man in a white tuxedo hops out of a limousine and spends a couple of minutes handing out $ 50 bills to passersby before being driven off.

<HEAD>Cheers To All-Day Drinking In British Pubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bartender's dreaded cry of `` last orders'' will not ring out in English pubs Monday afternoon for the first time since World War I. Instead, thanks to new laws that permit all-day drinking, pubs that open at 11 a.m. can continue serving beer and spirits until closing time at 11 p.m. `` We're hoping for a big crowd,'' said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, assistant manager of the Hog In The Pound pub near the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> shopping district. `` We're stacked up -LRB- with beer -RRB-. We've taken on a couple of extra people, just in case.'' Other pub owners who have lost trade to fast-food restaurants will expand their lunch menus. One even plans to sell tea and scones. Under the old system, pubs were forced to close from 3 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. The bartender's warning at 2:50 p.m. created a rush for one last pint, and 10 minutes later, to the cry of `` time, gentlemen, please,'' the fun was over. The government imposed the rule in 1915 to curb drinking by munitions workers. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> went to all-day drinking in 1977, but the restriction held in the 68,000 English and Welsh pubs until Monday. The British <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> opposes the extended hours, fearing increased alcohol-related illness and drunken-driving accidents. But no increase in alcohol abuse or surge in consumption was detected in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet minister responsible for liquor laws, likened the old restriction to a `` corset, a straitjacket, which has no particular rhyme or reason.'' Parliament agreed, and voted overwhelmingly in April to do away with the 2 -LCB- - hour afternoon dry period on Monday through Saturday, which has frustrated Britons and tourists alike A controversial amendment slipped in by the unelected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> extends opening times by one hour on Sunday, which has always had shorter drinking hours. Sunday hours were noon to 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. They are now noon to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Next to TV-gazing, dropping into the neighborhood pub is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most popular leisure activity, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunjohn </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, representing most of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 117 breweries The pub is where neighbors, still more men than women, congregate to play darts, work the slot machines and argue about soccer and politics. It's also the original fast-food outlet. In addition to a smorgasbord of beer, from light lagers to strong, dark ales, and other alcohol, pubs serve traditional English food like steak-and-kidney pie and bangers and mash. But pub attendance has been falling since 1979, when a recession hit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s heavy industries and cut blue-collar spending power, <PERSON> Dunjohn </PERSON> said. Faced with competition from fast-food chains and wine bars, which arrived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the same period, the beer market has gone flat. Beer consumption fell to 190 pints per capita a year in 1986 from 208 pints in 1976, although measured in terms of pure alcohol, consumption rose to 9.2 liters in 1986 from six liters in 1966. Pub managers and breweries, which own or have exclusive sales agreements with thousands of pubs, hope the new hours will revitalize business. Pubs will expand their food service to meet the afternoon trade, predicted <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, marketing manager for brewers <ORGANIZATION> Ind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates more than 700 pubs in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The British <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> expects 50,000 new jobs will be created in pubs and the catering trade. The <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> pub near <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> plans to serve full cream teas _ scones, <LOCATION> strawberry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> jam </LOCATION>, the works _ every afternoon. `` As far as I can see, the house -LRB- pub -RRB- will be more of a coffee shop in the afternoon than a drinking house,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who manages the pub with his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. `` I do n't think the average British person, after the initial shock, is going to be affected. It's more of a touristy thing.'' Only those pubs in busy tourist or commercial areas are expected to take advantage of the new hours, while those in residential areas will continue to close in the afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 13,000 pub managers, had feared increased overhead costs would push up beer prices if all pubs had to open in the afternoon. Beer prices have risen three to four pence -LRB- 5 cents -RRB- recently, but the breweries insist it's not because of the new hours. The going price for a pint of beer is 85 pence -LRB- $ 1.50 -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 The hills of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are alive again with the sounds of polkas, waltzes and military marches as town bands make a comeback in once-abandoned band shells and gazebos. Retired musicians, teen-agers and middle-age mothers who have n't played an instrument since high school are jumping on the bandwagon `` You have no idea how much fun it is,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Voisin </PERSON>, a former first trumpet of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and a third-generation town band musician. His grandfather conducted the municipal band in the French city of Angers. The legacy continues. <PERSON> Voisin </PERSON>'s 15-year-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, sits behind him in the <PERSON> Great </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> band shell that was built last year to replace the 1904 bandstand that had disappeared from its spot in front of Town Hall in the 1940s. `` Every once in a while I'll do a solo or a particularily difficult piece and I'll feel a little pat on my back, as if to say, ` Good job, Grandpa,''' he said. Band shells sprung up in parks across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1800s, but fell victim to radio, movie theaters and television sets in the middle of this century. Several band shells were destroyed; others simply were abandoned. One of the few towns that managed to keep the tradition going despite the lure of other pasttimes was <LOCATION> Shelburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, which boasts the second-oldest continuously operating town band in the nation. The band has played every summer since its founding in 1835. Its secretary, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Donelson </PERSON>, believes the band may be the oldest. The 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Shelburne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> includes one player with at least a half-century of service and three players with more than 40 years in the group. Among the players are a farmer, a retired fire chief, a college music professor and a few high school students. The band even has uniforms, a luxury among most bands. The 40-member Montague Community Band provides shirts but asks that musicians bring their own chairs. Mrs. <PERSON> Donelson </PERSON>, 54, said she took up the saxophone she had left behind in high school and joined the band as soon as her children grew up. `` I did n't have time when I was raising a family,'' she said. Her husband, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, 55, has beat the bass drum for the group every summer since 1952. A carpenter, he designed and built the town band shell in 1970. `` I do it for the fun of it,'' he said. `` If I did it for the money, I'd be done years ago.'' Like all town bands, the <LOCATION> Shelburne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> band depends mostly on the generosity of the board of selectmen to keep going, but it also raises money by charging fees for marching in other communities. The 50-member <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> celebrated its 99th year on Aug. 14 by marching a few blocks from its headquarters, the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where it was started by five men. The band has missed only a few summers, during World War II, since its beginning and has never had trouble recruiting, members say. `` We have no dues and no auditions,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Motyka </PERSON>, a 37-year veteran of the group, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegram </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had a fellow once who really had no musical ability, so we let him crash the cymbals.''

<TEXT>
 The retreat of Contra rebels and supporters to remote Honduran base camps threatens the survival of the insurgency to oust <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. The action also reverses months of political and military advances. Officials at the rebel camps said more than 14,000 Contra troops and civilians crossed the <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> border in the past four months into <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION> in the steep Honduran mountains. Rebel officers estimate that no more than 2,000 fighters remain in the northern Nicaraguan hills. The rebels blame the withdrawal on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which on Feb. 29 cut off military aid _ a bargaining chip, they say, for discussions to end the war that began in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has voted to grant only non-lethal aid distributed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` Our forces ca n't stay in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ surrounded by Sandinista troops _ without bullets in their rifles,'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the rebel commander and member of the Contra political directorate, said recently. `` Military aid must be a threat to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> to continue negotiating. We need to convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> we enter from a position of strength.'' Thousands of troops, many in new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> uniforms, wait at the base camps, occasionally falling into formation. They buoy each other's morale, playing baseball and checkers on homemade boards with toothpaste caps. Makeshift tents of wood stakes covered with plastic or ponchos dot the hillsides. The population of the refugee camps swelled from 8,000 at the start of 1987 to more than 13,000 at the end of June. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> claims that up to 200,000 Nicaraguans live illegally in its territory. At one of the camps, new arrivals, their clothes tattered from more than a month of walking, worked under the tropical sun to clear the brush. Many of the civilians said they followed the troops because they would suffer Sandinista repression without Contra protection. `` If we had aid, all our troops would be inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' said a 37-year-old Contra official whose nom de guerre is Commander <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` It will take a long time to get back to where we were.'' The first Contras came from the ranks of the national guard under dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, who was ousted in a 1979 revolutionary war that brought the Sandinisatas to power. A dozen rebels received training in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in 1981 and others were taught by CIA-contracted Argentine instructors at Honduran base camps. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was also held responsible for air drops of weapons, food and other supplies. The Contras' reputation as an unsavory band of ragtag thugs whose troops murdered civilians and kidnapped youths began changing in 1986. Peasants and young people joined their ranks, which swelled above 10,000. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 100 million military and humanitarian aid package in June 1986. By the following spring, the rebels, well-armed and many trained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, moved out of their Honduran base camps into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas accused the Contras of forcing recruitment and of a record number of human rights abuses. Asked about the abuses, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> acknowledged: `` There are still revenge killings by both sides, but it's not a policy of our organization.'' The rebels had their greatest battlefield and political gains against the Soviet-backed Sandinista government in 1987. They became more popular when the government drew increasing criticism for the failing economy, mandatory recruitment and repression. But the rebel advances of last year suffered setbacks in recent months. In a surprise move three weeks after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid ended Feb. 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contra civilian directorate signed an agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the war. The cease-fire plan prohibited the fighters from receiving any militery aid, but allowed non-lethal supplies to be distributed inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by a neutral international organization. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, citing the pact, withheld further military aid and in March allocated $ 15.5 million for supplies ranging from food to uniforms and $ 17.7 million for medical aid to child war victims. The supplies were to be distributed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. At about the same time, deep divisions emerged among the rebels. Some Contra commanders who signed the peace plan charged commander-in-chief <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> with corruption and called for a barracks uprising. The dissidents were purged and the troops rallied around <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who opposed the cease-fire. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a former colonel in <ORGANIZATION> Somoza </ORGANIZATION>'s national guard, was elected in July to the seven-member Contra political directorate and was said to have resigned his post as the military commander-in-chief. However, he clearly remains in control. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who recently visited the camps, listened as soldiers complained about the diet of rice and beans. Many of the ew arrivals are to start military training in September, while some of the civilians and fighters will head for nearby refugee camps run by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. But rebel officials said thousands of other fighters and civilians were expected to cross the border into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> soon. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, a Honduran farmer who allows the Contras to use his land, said `` incredible numbers'' of rebels had entered in recent days. `` Nicargua will soon be empty,'' said <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> called the cutoff of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid `` a tragedy for Central America'' and said he will seek support from other governments or private donors. Commander <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON>, 29, a company leader who has been fighting for seven years, said: `` I did n't want to come back here. We still have some bullets but we needed clothes, boots and food.'' `` We're willing to fight until the last drop of blood. We want liberty in our country,'' said the officer.

 Death may be a constant but the rituals change with the times, as a museum dedicated to dying and bereavement illustrates. Old embalming tools, a 1917 Ford Model-T hearse that doubled as an ambulance, intricately braided wreaths of human hair and a 1,500-pound glass casket are some of the memorabilia in <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s funeral museum, one of a handful in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If we can teach a little to a student, and help families understand the history, that death is natural ... this helps them understand there's a heritage to this process. The whole funeral process is a part of growing, of letting go,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> is president of National Selected Morticians, a 965-member trade group. A third-generation funeral director and antique enthusiast, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> inherited some displays from his father and grandfather. After he bought a large collection in 1986, there was no longer room to show them off at his business. The museum opened last year next to <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s funeral home. The 1,200 visitors have included mourners who stopped by after a funeral, tourists who have stumbled upon it and students from local high schools or community colleges. `` A lot of times, people sitting here will see the museum and we'll open it for them. It answers a lot of questions,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Plescia </PERSON>, grief counselor at Hunter's. Learning funeral history is a good way to brace for the future, said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Halporn </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thanatology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that studies dying, death and grieving. `` This is a death-denying culture. So when it happens, the pain is almost double. People without experience tend to want to eliminate everything _ no funeral. But each part of the ritual has significance,'' she said. `` When these rituals are established and practiced, it starts the bereavement process going in a healthy way,'' <PERSON> Halporn </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> career guidance teacher <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> agrees. She has taken <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students considering allied health careers on field trips to <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s for years. `` As weird as it sounds, it really is a good learning experience. Part of managing a career is understanding death. It's a good thing, because kids at this age have no experience with death,'' she says For <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the museum reflects the changes in American culture. `` The way funerals changed mirrors the way families changed.'' At the turn of the century funerals were still family reunions. Morticians visited homes to prepare the body, often laid out in parlors, and built made-to-measure coffins. `` On the day of the funeral, he would come again with his coffin and put the body in it and go to the church,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. As people moved to cities, wakes moved out of houses and funeral homes were born. Coffins used to be tapered on the ends and their inner metal liners were soldered. They are no longer tapered and now have self-sealing rubber gaskets. During the Victorian era, wreaths were fashioned from hair, generally that of the deceased, and a family might weave a huge multi-hued wreath over several generations. Hearses once regularly doubled as ambulances, a practice that ended with regulations that ambulances be painted white. That was hardly appropriate for a funeral vehicle, <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said, stroking his gleaming black Model-T, which won first prize _ as an ambulance _ at the <ORGANIZATION> Antique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 1982 show. Not all industry innovations caught on, like the solid glass casket on display. `` You take the 1,500 pounds and add another 175 pounds and we put that in a Model-T hearse and you've just flattened the tires,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. `` It's like one giant <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> bottle.'' Other funeral museums around the nation include a small display owned by <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beggs </PERSON> and Sons Funeral Home of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, and a traveling museum run by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s museum also houses a collection of 1900-era anatomy books for student morticians, yellowing funeral bills and complete issues of the trade journal `` The Casket'' dating back to 1892. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> sees industry changes ahead, such as more cremations, people paying for funerals in advance and the terminally ill opting to die in their own beds instead of in hospitals. `` The death pattern is changing,'' he said. `` We go to homes more often than we did five years ago.''

 A mother who won a two-year fight to enroll her 6-year-old AIDS-afflicted daughter in school finds her victory bittersweet. `` This is the closest <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> has been to a classroom. But I ca n't send her to school to sit in a cage,'' <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said.

Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is appealing a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> allowing <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> to start school Aug. 29, provided she remains behind a glass partition, isolated from other children in the classroom. Her attorney expects it to become a landmark case. `` The issues in this case involve critically important national policy,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, who is taking the case to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It's going to have long-lasting precedential effects.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, who is retarded, may attend <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a school for disabled children. But the judge spelled out restrictions. In the classroom, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> must stay isolated inside a specially built glass booth until she is toilet-trained and stops sucking her fingers. Other children may play with her only if their parents sign consent forms. The enclosure, located toward the back of the room, must be 8-by-10 feet with a large plexiglass window and sound system. It's to have a toilet and desk An aide would be assigned to <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> full time. <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school officials fought attempts to admit <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> to the classroom. They feared she might transmit to others the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids. However, the judge wrote, no AIDS cases have been proved to have been transmitted through exposure to urine, feces or saliva even though the virus that causes the disease has been found in these bodily secretions. AIDS, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. For the past year, a teacher has come to <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s home an hour a day; school officials wanted to continue that method of instruction. But Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> insisted that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> needed to be with other children. In her Aug. 8 ruling, Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said she was trying to address the concerns of both sides. Even though Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> says she wo n't send <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> to school next week, school officials are building an $ 8,000 glass enclosure. The plumbing is already finished. When Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> first heard the judge's ruling she started to cry. `` I was angry and confused,'' she said in an interview last week. `` I said to myself, ` There's no way I'm going to do that, see her behind a cage watching other children and wanting to get out and play with them.' Then there was the confusion, the fear. I thought is this the only way we're going to be able to do it?'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> quoted pediatric and psychological experts as saying the classroom restrictions would be harmful to <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> and could put even more stress on her weak immune system. <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> school board member and former teacher <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> called the booth `` cruel.'' `` If we did this in any other school setting for any other reason, the courts would have us there for child abuse,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> after she responded to a radio appeal in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> for a baby living at a hospital. Doctors believe that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, born prematurely, was exposed to AIDS when she had multiple transfusions as an infant. She has been on the AIDS-fighting drug AZT for the past year and her mother says she has improved noticeably over the last several months. The child's homebound teacher confirms that. `` She was deprived of family and we became that. She was deprived of health and we gave her the best medical attention we could,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> says. `` Now, I do n't want her deprived of an education. She needs more than an hour a week to progress. And she needs friends.''

<HEAD>Anniversary Rekindles Interest in Hatfiled-McCoy Feud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One hundred years after the Hatfield-McCoy feud ended, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is embroiled in a polite debate on the propriety of cashing in on the bloodshed. Guides at Chief Logan State Park led three-hour tours of Feudin' Country during a weeklong festival that ended Sunday The show included films, slide shows, music and souvenirs. `` This part of the state does n't have high mountains and waterfalls, but we do have the most interesting history,'' said <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, a park ranger who leads the tours. `` It's not something to be proud of, but it is history.'' `` I guess things had to be settled one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, 66, who went on one of the tours last week. `` That's life, honey To know what went on years ago.'' At least 14 people died in the feud that pitted the <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> clan of <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, against the <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> clan of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, part of which is now <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> No one knows what prompted the bloodshed. Speculation centers on a stolen hog and a Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two members of the families. Whatever set it off, it took the intervention of the governors of two states to bring peace in 1888. The tour covers five cemeteries, two dilapidated houses, one battle site and some papaw bushes at the site where three <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> brothers were slain by the Hatfields. Only one <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> cemetery is included, and some Kentuckians have half-jokingly accused the guides of slanting the tour toward <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. State officials say they left out <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> sites because they were too far away. While many revel in the homespun notoriety, some historians contend that reviving the Hatfield-McCoy feud perpetuates ugly stereotypes of Appalachians. `` To me, it's very sad for this to be a commercial thing. It's playing on a stereotype which I do n't like,'' said <PERSON> Altina </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, a former history professor at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> whose book, `` Feud: Hatfields, McCoys and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, 1860-1900,'' recently was published by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> press `` On the other hand, it's sort of coming to terms with history,'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. The publicity, which pops up frequently in national magazines and newspapers, may hurt the area more than help it, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Eller </PERSON>, director of the Appalachian Center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's probably been few other things in Appalachian history that have reflected more of the negative stereotype as the Hatfield-McCoy feud,'' <PERSON> Eller </PERSON> said. `` The national imagery is that they were backwoods, isolated mountain farmers. In reality, they were very important families who competed for land access that would lead to economic development.'' The tours in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are spurring some interest in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> wants to arrange similar tours. Sites would include the remnants of the house where the stolen hog trial was held; the place where a <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> supporter was hanged; and the grave of <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, patriarch of the <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> clan. `` Since it is an internationally known part of our heritage, we need to capitalize on it,'' said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venters </PERSON>, the council's president `` It's something that the present generation wants to know more about.'' <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge-Executive <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> is n't so sure. `` The Hatfield-McCoy feud is one thing that most people are aware of. I guess people hold on to that as one thing that might grow into a significant tourist industry,'' he said. But `` it certainly might not promote the type of image we want.''

 With the cause of their deaths still shrouded in mystery, the bodies of Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> were returned from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Sunday with full military honors and tributes from two Cabinet members. As grieving family members watched the flag-draped coffins which pallbearers carried past a 19-man military cordon, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> `` two of our best'' and said the nation is `` better and safer'' because of their sacrifice. `` As professionals and patriots, they were committed to the inseparable principles needed for success: a readiness to engage with others diplomatically to reach agreement and a readiness to apply strength in the interests of a safer world,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The 15-minute ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, occurred four days after the Pakistani C-130 aircraft in which they were flying crashed 330 miles south of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, claiming the lives of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and 29 others. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> delayed a long-planned vacation to travel to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for the funeral service Saturday for <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, perhaps the closest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally in the Islamic world. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told mourners at the airbase outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> `` paid the ultimate price'' for the defense of his country and `` helped make the world a safer place for all of us.'' <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> was one of the most experienced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats on southwest <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> was the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense official in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> refused to speculate on the cause of the crash because investigators, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts flown to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, are just beginning their work. But acting Pakistani President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said Saturday his government suspects sabotage. `` Judging from the circumstances of the tragedy ... enemies of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are actively posing a threat to the security of our country,'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. During his 11-year rule, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> acquired many enemies because of his authoritarian rule, and there were at least two abortive military coups seeking his ouster. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said a Soviet-trained and organized <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> intelligence service has to be `` among the suspects'' because of its alleged role in carrying out terrorist acts in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The official noted <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s strong support for Afghan rebels fighting the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The airport ceremony took place in the shadow of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet that returned the remains of <LOCATION> Wassom </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, both of whom had served in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for a little more than a year. Dozens of government officials and family members were on hand for the solemn homecoming, the first of its kind involving a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador since the February 1979 death of the ambassador <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubs </PERSON>, who died in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON> were in the front line of the struggle for values that Americans hold dear. `` Arnie and <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> went halfway around the world to join the fight for these great causes, not just for others but for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` If we do not work to shape a world in freedom, peace, prosperity and justice, then here at home those principles will be endangered and could be lost.'' <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, walked hand in hand with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as they left the plane. In addition to his parents and a brother, <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON>, 45, also is survived by <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, a 19-year old daughter by a previous marriage. <PERSON> Wassom </PERSON>, 49, is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, and two children, <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON>. A funeral service will be held Monday at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meyer </LOCATION>, a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> post, with burial in Arlington National Cemetery.

 The Olympic Games do n't open until next month, but illustrator <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> has already won some artistic gold medals. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service chose designs submitted by <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> for both the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympic commemoratives. The summer stamp, which depicts a male gymnast, was issued Friday at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, whose realistic depictions have graced the covers of Time, Sports Illustrated and dozens of other magazines, has been chosen by the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> Olympic Committee as the official artist of the summer games. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, 49, was commissioned to finish 12 paintings before he leaves for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> next month. He will paint about 20 more for a museum that will commemorate the games. A golfer and sometime-tennis player, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> says he's not an athlete, but his studio in a renovated century-old two-story building in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' arts district is trimmed with old baseballs, hats and other sports paraphernalia. `` Sports is a subject matter I like to do,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said, calling the Olympics assignment a career highlight. `` It's fun. It's exciting and timely.'' Timely but not dated. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> believes well done art is timeless. `` I do n't want to get caught doing finish-line illustrations,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said of the typical sporting event depiction. `` The crux for any painter or illustrator is not being satisfied with the first or most obvious solution,'' he said. The challenge, he continued, is to portray the human spirit of the games, how athletes respond to enormous pressure, for instance. `` Many of the athletes train four years for just one shot. It's an incredible event Sure, there are some who are just glad they made it to the Olympics, but for so many they're there for only one thing: a gold medal.'' An art graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> earned an advanced degree at the Art Center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Unsure of his ability to break into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> design industry, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> settled in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for several years after school. Later, after spending five years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> returned with his family to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. He said he's lucky to be able to live where he wants and work on a `` national scale.'' Forbes paints with a simple realism he says is influenced by the American artists <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eakins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> <PERSON> Homer </PERSON>, among others. The <ORGANIZATION> KOC </ORGANIZATION> commission was something of a coincidence. When the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, honored <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> as its sports artist of the year in 1987, he shared the graduate school's spotlight with <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Ha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. A few weeks after that meeting, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> he'd been chosen the committee's official artist and invited him to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for a week to make preparations. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' first 12 paintings, based on that visit, will be part of a calendar the <ORGANIZATION> KOC </ORGANIZATION> will sell during the Olympics, which begin September 17. In all, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> will create an original work depicting each Olympic event as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.

 <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>, a philosopher and self-proclaimed `` dandy'' who announced last year he was suffering from AIDS, has died at the age of 61, hospital officials said. `` Nothing in the world would have made me talk publicly about my homosexuality,'' if he had not contracted AIDS, <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> said recently. Officials at <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> hospital would not disclose the details of the illness that led to <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>'s death Saturday morning. In an interview on French television, <PERSON> Aron </PERSON> said he felt an obligation to break the `` taboo'' surrounding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system. AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. `` The silence about this illness must be broken,'' he said. `` The intellectual, whose duty is to truth, can recount better than others the great stakes for society that surround this illness.'' <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>, a nephew of the late French philosopher <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Aron </PERSON>, taught philosphy at the universities of <LOCATION> Tourcoing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lille </LOCATION>, wrote books on the sociology of the 19th century, published novels, produced plays and wrote for the newspapers <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Matin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON>. He said that `` dandyism'' was the perfect word to describe his approach to life. `` Dandyism is the apotheosis of the different,'' he said in an interview with the magazine <PERSON> Nouvel </PERSON> <PERSON> Observateur </PERSON>. `` It is the tragedy of the dandy, whose solution is in death.''

<HEAD>Diplomat: Up To 3,000 Killed In Ethnic Violence In Burundi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ethnic clashes in northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> last week left about 3,000 people dead and sent at least 16,000 fleeing across the border to escape the bloodbath, a diplomat said Sunday. `` The facts are very, very sketchy because of the remoteness of the area and the nature of the thing itself,'' said the diplomat, who is based in the tiny Central African country and who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` But there has been no major violence since the first 24 hours.'' Previous reports said that several thousand people were killed, but the diplomat was the first official to give a specific figure. The earlier reports also said that only 7,000 Burundians fled their country. The fighting began Aug. 14 between the Hutu, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s majority tribe, and the <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>, the minority tribe that controls the military and rules the country. `` The majority of the victims were Tutsi,'' said the diplomat, who was reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Bujumbura </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> capital. One media report, quoting an anonymous source, said 24,000 were killed, but the diplomat called that figure `` extremely exaggerated.'' By Friday, at least 16,000 Burundians _ Hutu and <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> _ had fled into neighboring <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, the diplomat said. A 7 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was clamped on <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. Meetings of more than five people and travel between towns were banned. The government blamed the trouble on outsiders. `` We suspect that some former Hutu refugees infiltrated the country from from foreign countries. They incited the Hutu population and called on them to massacre the Tutsi population,'' <PERSON> Astere </PERSON> <PERSON> Nzisabira </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, said last week. The two tribes are longtime enemies. After an abortive coup attempt in 1972 in the former <LOCATION> Belguim </LOCATION> colony, the Tutsis responded by massacring 100,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, with nearly 5 million people crammed into an area about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, is one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most densely populated countries. Eighty-four percent of its people are Hutu, while 15 percent are Tutsis. In the northern area where last week's violence occurred, the Hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population. Most of the killings occurred near two communes known as Marangara and Ntega. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> is mostly rural and people reside in such communes. `` It's mostly hillsides covered with houses,'' the diplomat said of the area. Peace was restored to the region within a day after the army moved in, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hutu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an exiled opposition group, charged in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> that the Tutsi-dominated military had massacred thousands of <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON>. But the diplomatic source said there was no evidence of that. Ethnic struggles have plagued <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> Belguim </LOCATION> in 1962. For generations, the tall, lanky Tutsi held the short, stocky <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> in feudal serfdom. In 1976, Col. <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> mounted a bloodless coup that ousted <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Micombero </PERSON>, who had sanctioned the Hutu slaughter four years earlier. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Micombero </PERSON>, was a Tutsi. <PERSON> Bagaza </PERSON> was overthrown in a bloodless coup Sept. 4, by Maj. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Buyoya </PERSON>, a Tutsi who pledged to resolve ethnic differences.

<HEAD>Government Seeks To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> JOHANNESBURG </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ The government plans to push ahead with tough new measures that would strengthen residential segregation, despite critics who say the proposals are `` straight out of the darkest ages of apartheid.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> meet Monday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to debate a bill aimed at tightening enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which segregates all neighborhoods by race. Black activists, white businessmen and even the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> have condemned the measure, saying it entrenches apartheid and would force the evictions of thousands of blacks living peacefully, but illegally, in `` whites only'' areas. The proposed Group Areas Amendment Bill would make it easier to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race group. `` It is a wicked, wicked, bill,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will drive decent people out of their homes.'' The bill calls for hiring inspectors to check for violations of the law. The maximum fine for property owners who allow a person to live outside his group area would increase from about $ 165 to $ 4,100. The maximum prison sentence would be increased from two years to five years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has a surplus of housing in white neighborhoods, but a severe shortage in black areas. Thousands of non-whites have been moving into white areas such as <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> in recent years. The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old Group Areas Act, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated neighborhoods. The issue of segregated neighborhoods is one of the hottest topics in the campaign for nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26, and the bill is seen as an accommodation to right-wing whites. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said last week he believes segregated housing is favored by 80 percent of whites, 70 percent of Asians and people of mixed race and a majority of blacks. `` It is rubbish to say 70 percent of our people would support the -LRB- Group Areas -RRB- Act,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is this country's most dangerous liability It is about time he stepped down to make way for a person of greater vision and perception.'' Lawmakers also will address legislation that would allow creation of the first legal multiracial neighborhoods. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would have veto power over any plans to create such `` open area.'' Other housing-related bills on the agenda seek to toughen existing laws against black slum areas and squatter settlements. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has as many as 7 million squatters among its 35 million population, according to some estimates. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is confronted by ... bills straight out of the darkest ages of apartheid,'' said the independent Sunday Times, the country's largest Sunday newspaper. `` Authorities will be armed with powers to summarily evict thousands, perhaps millions of people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial. `` Why must the legal process be distorted, property seized, witch hunters licensed and countless people be rendered homeless?'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s traffic court system are pressured to maintain high conviction rates and to give police officers special guidance to make successful cases, a newspaper reported Sunday. The system, run by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, operates `` in a fashion that is unfair, both in face and appearance, to the average motorist,'' according to an 11-month investigation conducted by the state <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cases are not necessarily decided on the facts, but rather on a preconceived idea of how many should be guilty,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the former state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judge who led the inquiry. Among the findings of the study were that administrative law judges are pressed to be tough on motorists and to give police officers preferential treatment. The deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vehicles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, told the newspaper that the bar association report `` completely distorted the record.'' `` Bits and pieces of information were put together and they leaped to conclusions not supported by the record and not supported by a fair and competent review of the system,'' he said. The bar association report said supervisors pressure judges to set higher fines and increase convictions. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> officials track the percentage of guilty and innocent verdicts and average fines, and judges are required to review their monthly records with their bosses. The report also says judges are `` virtual advocates for the police'' who routinely ask the officers leading questions to help them make their cases.

<HEAD>Doctors Will Have Smoking Check-off On Death Certificates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oregon will add a section to state death certificates next year asking doctors to comment on the role tobacco played in the deaths of their patients. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant-Worley </PERSON>, the state Health Division's chief research analyst, said last week that the 1989 death certificates will ask, `` Did tobacco use contribute to the death?'' Doctors will be able to check boxes marked `` yes,'' `` no,'' `` probably'' or `` unknown.'' <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> is the first state in the nation to add such a section to its death certificates, <PERSON> Grant-Worley </PERSON> said. The information will be used in ongoing studies of the link between smoking and death rates, she said. Oregon's research began in 1987, and while doctors were encouraged to report smoking-related deaths, the state provided no reminder on the forms. In the past, the state sent letters to doctors asking about tobacco use if lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis or heart disease were reported on the death certificate without mention of smoking. `` We know that cigarette smoking kills,'' said <PERSON> Bonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Groshong </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe this will give us stronger ammunition to take to the public to convince them.'' Health Division statistics gathered since 1987 from the voluntary participation of doctors indicate that tobacco use contributed to 70 percent to 82 percent of respiratory disease deaths in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Before 1987, smoking was listed on fewer than 5 percent of the death certificates that listed the respiratory diseases as the cause of death. Researchers say the deaths of about one in seven men and one in 10 women in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were caused by lung cancer or other respiratory diseases in 1987. State health officials hope the statistics eventually will help lawmakers and health groups to plan programs to cut the smoking rate and identify those at risk for respiratory diseases. `` They'll probably find that cigarettes are responsible for a tremendous number of deaths in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parosa </PERSON>, a Salem lung specialist. Oregon has one of the highest rates of respiratory disease in the nation. The state's 1987 lung cancer death rate was 59.7 per 100,000 population _ 9.1 percent higher than the estimated national rate.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> charged Sunday that Iraqi troops violated a cease-fire hours after it started by firing shots near a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer team in the central sector of the front. Shipping sources in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> said two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> patrol craft, one described as a speedboat, were patrolling the strategic Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gateway to the gulf, and the Shatt <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, which marks the southern boundary between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It was the first report of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> craft on patrol since the cease-fire took effect early Saturday morning after eight years of hostilities that claimed an estimated 1 million lives. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said 10 `` small-caliber bullets'' were fired by the Iraqis in the Naftshahr sector 3 -LCB- hours after the cease-fire began. The agency did not mention any casualties, but it said the gunfire occurred in the presence of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is monitoring the truce. On Saturday, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said an Iranian sniper infiltrated an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ground position and killed a private. It did not say whether the soldier was captured. It said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not retaliate for the incident, which allegedly took place in the <LOCATION> Saif </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saad </LOCATION> sector of the front line, a disputed border area 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday quoted an unidentified official in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> as denying the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> claims. `` Not a single bullet has been fired at <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> positions'' since the cease-fire took effect, the official was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> sent a message to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> asking the world body to try to ensure that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stopped intercepting Iraqi merchant ships, the Iraqi agency said. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> was referring to the interception Saturday of an Iranian merchant ship, the <PERSON> Khawla </PERSON>, in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said an Iranian helicopter gunship and a warship shadowed the vessel. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> declared Sunday it would intercept ships suspected of carrying war material to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> until a comprehensive peace treaty had been signed. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abiyaneh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had the right under international law to intercept and search ships suspected of carrying war-related materials until a peace treaty has been signed with <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Although both sides have accepted the cease-fire, they are still technically in a state of war. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, meanwhile, said Sunday <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would unilaterally release 70 handicapped prisoners of war as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was ready to take them. Iraqi and Iranian negotiators meet face-to-face in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Thursday to work on a comprehensive peace settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` cut his way through rejoicing crowds in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'' during mass celebrations by flag-waving countrymen Saturday to mark the halt in hostilities. The Iraqi government declared Sunday, normally a working day in the Moslem world, a national holiday to celebrate <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s `` decisive victory ... and the first step toward a comprehensive peace.'' In another development, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Golamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would repair vital oil facilities battered in the war at `` maximum speed'' as soon as the cease-fire `` proves durable,'' says. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said Saturday <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would go ahead with major oil industry projects to boost exports, refining capacity and exploration and to expand its energy industry.

<HEAD>In-House Training Programs Said Biggest Source of Skilled Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employers of technical and other skilled workers look to in-house training programs more than any other source for filling their manpower needs, according to a survey by private trade schools released Sunday. More than 70 percent of the 400 businesses questioned rated in-house training programs as an important source of skilled employees, according to the survey commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Technical Schools. Sixty percent of the employers listed four-year colleges and universities as important sources of skilled labor, followed by 50 percent who listed private trade schools and 45 percent who cited vocational high schools. Two-year public vocational schools such as community colleges were listed by 44 percent of the businesses as an important source of skilled labor while union apprenticeship programs were listed by only 26 percent of the employers. The telephone survey was limited to computer programming and service companies, auto repair shops, radio, television and appliance repair firms, and physicians' and dentists' offices. All are most likely to hire skilled and technical workers, the association said. While 62 percent of the surveyed companies said they have graduates of private trade and technical schools on their payrolls, only 50 percent said they actively recruit them. Only 14 percent said they actually contract with such schools to train workers for them. Medical and dental offices said they were most satisfied by the performance of trade school graduates, followed by radio, TV and appliance repair shops and computer-related businesses. Auto repair shops were the least satisfied, with only 16 percent listing trade school graduates on their payrolls as excellent performers. Auto repair shops tended more than the other employer groups to rely most on in-house training programs. Only 46 percent of the surveyed companies said students graduating from private trade schools had a better chance of getting a high-paying job than graduates of public vocational schools. `` In general, employers are satisfied with the job we do,'' said association chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said he was concerned that one-third of the respondents agreed with a statement that private schools appear more interested in making a profit than training students, and that many exist only to take advantage of federal grants and loans. `` Obviously some bad publicity from a small percentage of schools has hurt our image,'' he said. `` Schools are profitable because they train well and their graduates get jobs. Our incentive is to make more students succeed because then we succeed. The two go hand-in-hand.''

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cabinet on Sunday shortened <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s work week from six days to five, granting public workers a two-day weekend for the first time, a government spokesman said. The plan, part of a long-term wage agreement, will affect about 400,000 public sector employees, including teachers, government and health workers, a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Public workers constitute approximately one-third of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s labor force. `` We do not expect financial gain from this, but if the whole world has discovered the secret of a five-day week, there must be a good reason,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>. Israeli workers currently work a 45-hour week, with full days Sunday through Thursday and a half-day on Friday. Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath. The week will gradually be reduced to 42 -LCB- hours, spread over five days, and then to 40 hours, <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> said. The plan will be implemented in stages and is expected to be fully in effect by the end of 1989, he said. <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> did not say when the first phase would begin. Public transportation, businesses and restaurants are closed in most Israeli cities on the Sabbath. The two-day weekend will give people a chance to shop, eat out, go to movies and travel on Fridays. Many private businesses have already instituted a five-day work week, and others are expected to follow suit.

 Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Styron </PERSON> was awarded the prestigious <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Medal </PERSON> for his lifetime achievements Sunday, but told the audience he was n't sure such honors should be necessary. `` Are prizes necessary or even desirable?'' the author of `` Sophie's Choice'' asked the crowd of 800 at the 450-acre MacDowell artists' colony. `` Should n't the satisfaction of one's work be sufficient reward? <PERSON> Styron </PERSON>, who joins 28 previous medalists including <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Keeffe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Updike </PERSON>, noted that his American literary ancestors never had to deal with the egos and competition involved in prize winning. `` No medals for <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON>, no medals for -LRB- <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, no medals for -LRB- Walt -RRB- <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>. No medals, no prizes, no annual publisher's award, no seal of approval, no fellowships or grants,'' <PERSON> Styron </PERSON> said. Yet <PERSON> Styron </PERSON>, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for `` The Confessions of Nat Turner'' and the American Book Award for `` <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON>'s Choice,'' said he found the medal `` one of the purest awards for artistic achievement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' because it was judged by <PERSON> Updike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> and other prominent authors. Previous award winners `` represent the brightest constellation of talent that could be assembled in the late half of this century,'' <PERSON> Styron </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Styron </PERSON> said he is continuing work on a novel about the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and on a non-fiction work based on his recent visit to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Styron </PERSON>'s previous works have taken on larger issues such as racism and the Holocaust, but he called the war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> a shameful conflict, and said he was shocked there was `` almost no passion or feeling on the part of American writers to try to find a solution to it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> MacDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION> provides private studios to painters, sculptors, musicians and other artists. It was founded by the widow of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDowell </PERSON>, a composer who died in 1908.

 A Soviet rocket crashed in northeastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Sunday morning after lighting up the sky from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> as it fell out of orbit, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. No injuries or damage were reported. The craft, which plummeted to Earth at about 1 a.m. EDT, was launched by the Soviets on Aug. 18 to carry a <ORGANIZATION> Gorizont </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite into orbit, said Maj. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Space Command, speaking from <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. He said the rocket was probably an SL12, one of the Soviets' workhorse models `` It's not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit,'' he said. `` There's nothing to keep it there.'' The craft was tracked by officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where about 7,200 space vehicles are constantly being surveilled. An average of one space vehicle reenters the Earth's atmosphere each day, he said. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said the rocket had `` no connection whatsoever'' to the Cosmos 1900, an out-of-control, nuclear-powered <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy satellite that has been falling out of orbit for several months. Cosmos 1900, launched last Dec. 12, is now expected to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in late September or early October, <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> provided no further details about the craft's condition when it reached the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> or the precise location where it came down. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where downed satellites plummet to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` I do understand it was pretty spectacular,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. He said the downing of the craft, which he referred to as a `` non-nuclear Soviet rocket body,'' was expected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. `` It was predicted it would come down, it came down as predicted and it came down where it was predicted,'' he said. <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON> said officials do not try to recover parts of such rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon reentry. `` That spectacular light show that they provide folks with is the rocket body burning up,'' he said. Two other federal agencies, questioned earlier Sunday about reports that a Soviet satellite had crashed in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> area, said they had no direct evidence of such an event. Lt. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said his agency had heard that members of the public had reported seeing something crash in the area of the Great Lakes. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had not recovered debris or even searched for any. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawes </PERSON>, a duty officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had not tracked a falling object.

<HEAD>British Diplomat Sees Imprisoned Briton in Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> permitted a British diplomat on Sunday to visit a Briton imprisoned in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for nearly two years without trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. Diplomat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, who went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Aug. 12 following a thaw in relations between the two countries, found <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> `` in good health and reasonably cheerful,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said. They met for 30 minutes, and the diplomat gave the prisoner some `` creature comforts,'' including cheese and pickles from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON>, who <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> says was a tourist, was detained by the Iranians in September 1986 for allegedly firing a gun near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Iranian authorities said he had infiltrated into their country from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He has not been charged, and the Iranians barred consular access to him until Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> had also been given an indication that he will be able to see <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a second Briton held without trial by the Iranians. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a businessman who lived in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for more than 20 years, was accused of spying in November 1985. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has complained that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was initially charged with overstaying his visa and that the spying charge came later. He and Nicola are held at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s maximum-security Evin Prison. Permission to see <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> was given at a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> representatives earlier Sunday. <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to examine the possibility of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> resuming a full-time diplomatic presence there. A recent, gradual easing of strain between the two countries has also raised hopes for release of three Britons, including <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, who are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists. Eighteen foreigners are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans.

 Three men and a women fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Sunday by swimming across a river to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, narrowly avoiding a patrol boat and clambering up a river bank to safety, news reports and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said the woman in the group injured a foot in the early evening swim of about 260 feet across <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The others were uninjured. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television showed video footage of the escapees swimming the last 10 feet to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> bank just as the East German patrol boat approached a few yards away. <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said the film was taken by a Briton who happened to be on the western bank at the time. The report did not provide the names of the escapees or of the person taping the scene. The Wall separating communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is located on the eastern side of the river at the spot where the escape took place. However, the western bank of the river is the actual border, with the water in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory. A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said East German border guards did not shoot or otherwise attempt to stop the escapees. No shots were fired from the patrol boat. Police said they did not know how the four got past the Wall, which is 10 feet high in most sections. The three western sectors of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is the Soviet sector of the city, which is located 110 miles east of the West German border.

 Troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and pushed them out of a central park Sunday when the protesters began chanting `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'' in memory of the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 20 years ago. Several dozen people, some shouting `` Fascists!'' at police, were taken away, but the exact number was not known. No injuries were reported among the 500 demonstrators and onlookers or the 500 national guard soldiers and police. The protest was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an unsanctioned political party that Soviet officials have denounced as illegal. About 100 demonstrators staged a second rally later Sunday along the Arbat shopping mall, said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuyev </PERSON>. He said police chased them and arrested an unspecified number who resisted. Soviet television carried a report on the nightly news program `` Vremya'' showing a relatively quiet scene in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The announcer said few residents of the Czechoslovak capital heeded calls to demonstrate on the anniversary. There was no mention of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> demonstrations. But reporters in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said an estimated 10,000 people marched through the city shouting `` Freedom!'' and `` Russians go home!'' They said the march began after a rally in Wenceslas Square. Police did not interfere for about 30 minutes but then blocked the marchers. At least five people were reported detained. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, termed the first demonstration in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a `` planned provocative gathering'' and denounced the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> as a group of anti-socialist agitators. It said the activists were given a written warning from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> authorities that they were banned from holding a public rally. The crackdown was in keeping with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s steadfast defense of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of Aug. 20-21, 1968, although some Soviets have suggested the `` Prague Spring'' reforms crushed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> resemble those now being tried in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the first protest, busloads of uniformed police and troops surrounded the park across from <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and shouted over loudspeakers: `` Leave the designated area or you will be detained.'' The crowd responded by chanting the name of the Czechoslovak capital. The well-organized police action prevented display of any banners or placards. People who tried to unfurl slogans were seized by the troops, who grew in force during the late-afternoon action to eventually number 500. Those speaking out were grabbed by groups of police, soldiers, plainclothes agents and volunteers and carried roughly to buses that were parked around the park's perimeter. What began at 4 p.m. as an orderly gathering turned into a melee as the soldiers in gray uniforms and berets linked arms and charged the crowd to force it out of the park. The human cordons swept protesters, journalists and bystanders alike into surrounding streets and bushes. Several pairs of smashed eyeglasses lay on steps and walkways after the demonstrators were forced out. `` Fascists! Fascists! Shame on you!'' activists shouted as police grabbed those who tried to address the crowd and carried them onto waiting buses. `` Is this what you call ` glasnost?''' one woman shouted out in English, referring to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for more openness and democracy. The woman identified herself only as an American tourist. Most of the demonstrators returned within a few minutes and began chanting `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' and `` Shame on the occupiers.'' When they refused to disperse, more soldiers were summoned and the mass of demonstrators was forced onto busy Gorky Street, which separates the park area from <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` This is a nightmare. They grabbed me by the hair and threw me in the bus,'' <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazaryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> told reporters after convincing the soldiers she had only been a bystander. `` They're fascists. When a plainclothesman shouted at her and a companion that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was an illegal organization, <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Babasyan </PERSON> shouted back: `` I'm not a member of any union, but we have a right to walk around.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency on Friday denounced the `` Prague Spring'' reforms as anti-socialist activity that attempted to `` tear <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> away from the socialist community.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dismissed comparisons between the liberalization orchestrated by then-Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and those now championed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The news agency called such comparisons the result of Western propaganda and defended the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion ago as the correct action of concerned friends and neighbors. But a Soviet historian writing for the journal Arguments and Facts noted this month that the reform program crushed by Soviet tanks 20 years ago had the same aims as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort for perestroika, or rebuilding. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, said at a news conference last week that the main difference between the two reform movements was `` 20 years.'' But he held to the standard Kremlin defense of its action as a necessary move to protect the gains of socialist revolution.

 Gusty winds spread fires to at least 350,000 acres in Yellowstone National Park, while 1,100 soldiers were trained Sunday to reinforce firefighters battling a 110,000-acre fire advancing toward two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> communities. The 60 mph winds that whipped the fires into 100-foot walls of flame and 30,000-foot columns of smoke Saturday calmed down somewhat by Sunday but were expected to reach about 25 mph, park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. `` We have an intense fire situation in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. About 3,000 firefighters have been fighting fires for several weeks in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Eighteen instructors from the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> trained troops at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to relieve civilian firefighters and free expert crews for more complex work, fire officials said. The soldiers were to board Army transport planes Monday morning for flights to <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, where they will be assigned to the Clover-Mist fire in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarver </PERSON>, a civilian installation operations officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base south of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. The winds in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> forced evacuation and closure of the park's south entrance as well as the <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> area, which contains a hotel, campground and housing for park staff. Several stretches of road inside the park, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Norris </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and Madison campgrounds, also remained closed Sunday. On Sunday, several hundred residents of Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, two communities in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, considered evacuating because the 100,000-acre fire was within six miles of their homes, said <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Grizzly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> in Silver Gate. `` Some residents are packing and we have alerted elderly people,'' he said. Most of the residents, mostly summer people, will stay and fight, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> added. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters battled blazes across the state that totalled more than 115,000 acres, the worst fires in the state since 1984 when more than 250,000 acres were charred. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters brought under control a 1,237-acre brush fire on the rocky north slope of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on Saturday, while a 300-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was contained, officials said. Hot, dry winds Sunday plagued 200 firefighters in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, where a 320-acre fire burned in inaccessible terrain 11 miles north of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, about 1,900 firefighters encircled about 80 percent of the pesky 35,200-acre Warm Springs fire in the <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> about 10 miles southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> of the Department of State Lands. The fire, which has burned 10 homes and cabins since it started Aug. 9, did not threaten any structures, <PERSON> Knepps </PERSON> said. National Guard transport planes from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will continue to drop retardant on the fire, he said, while crews try to finish encircling fire lines. But the Hellroaring Creek fire, in the inaccessible Absarokee-Beartooth Wilderness Area 170 miles southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, tripled to about 33,000 acres, said <ORGANIZATION> Gallatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>. A fire on the northeast side of the Absarokee-Beartooth, in the <ORGANIZATION> Custer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, flared in up to 70 mph winds Saturday to roughly 15,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> drainage, said spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON>. The Stillwater fire is to the north of Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, adding to residents' fears. Trails into the area were closed and recreationists were warned by rangers to leave, <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON> said. However, officials in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> said they were optimistic because of cooler temperatures and dying winds. Hundreds of other firefighters fought a dozen smaller blazes. Two new fires in the <LOCATION> Bridger-Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> and Grand Teton National Park in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> spread to more than 7,500 acres, forcing the evacuation of about 40 students from the summer <ORGANIZATION> Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and guests from several ranches. Officials also closed the Rockefeller Junior Memorial Parkway linking <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and Grand Teton, said fire information officer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zufelt </PERSON>.

An emaciated <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who according to his doctor lost 33 -LCB- pounds or 19 percent of his body weight, was assisted to the Mass with his arms draped around the necks of two other sons, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attended with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>, and both appeared shocked at <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s condition. Also attending were three of Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. The senator dramatically shared a Roman Catholic Communion that ended <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s first major fast 20 years ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began a three-day fast of his own to support the boycott called to protest use of certain pesticides on table grapes. Thousands of union supporters, including movie stars and politicians, attended the Mass held outdoors under a giant white tent in near 100-degree heat. After he sat in a wooden rocker, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> leaned over to his 96-year-old mother, who was crying, and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 61, kept up the water-only fast, his longest, despite doctors' advice that he was endangering his health. He conducted a 25-day fast in 1968 and a 24-day fast in 1972. Since he began the fast July 17, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union president suffered from escalating bouts of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and cramps. Doctors caring for <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> were concerned last week that he would n't have the strength to sustain the fast until Sunday. His doctors worried about his early dehydration and elevated levels of uric acid, which can lead to kidney failure. Doctors reported on Aug. 13 that <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> had consumed all of his body fat and that he was beginning to burn muscle tissue. After the Mass, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> was taken from the union compound in this community 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to an undisclosed location where he will have a liquid diet, including light broth and non-citrus juices for a week to 10 days, said one of his physicians, Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>. `` Recovery will be long and slow,'' she said, adding that <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, a vegetarian, began the fast in good health and remained mentally sharp throughout. The mass was <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s first public appearance since Aug. 11, when he ceased attending nightly community meetings. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> began this fast to emphasize his demand for a ban on five pesticides used on table grapes. The union claims the materials cause cancer in field workers and pose other serious health risks. Grape growers and grocers blasted <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> and the union for unduly frightening consumers about the safety of table grapes in an effort to fight a political battle. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> raised the pesticide issue in 1986, and called for Captan, Dinoseb, <LOCATION> Phosdrin </LOCATION>, methyl bromide and Parathion to be taken off the market. In the early days of this fast, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> held union meetings, visited with union delegations, meditated, prayed and went on a daily walk. As his strength waned, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> steadily scaled back his activities. He spent increasing amounts of time bedridden in a small bare room in the union's retirement village, and his staff entered the room only at his request.

 Israeli soldiers fatally shot two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers Sunday and 12 other Arabs were wounded during bloody clashes in the occupied lands, hospital officials said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police announced the arrest of four men in connection with a bomb attack that wounded 25 Israelis near a crowded sidewalk cafe in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Palestinians observed a general strike Sunday to mark the 19th anniversary of an arson fire that ravaged a mosque in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In the village of Tubas in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and killed 17-year-old <PERSON> Rajah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON> during a clash, according to officials at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said the army put a curfew on the Bureij refugee camp after 18-year-old <PERSON> Nael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> was shot to death during a clash with soldiers. The deaths brought to 251 the number of Palestinians killed since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Haviv </PERSON> said he is certain terrorists staged a Saturday night hand grenade attack in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. He announced the arrest of four men from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> suspected in the attack, which wounded 25 Israelis in a crowded shopping mall in the northeastern port city. <PERSON> Haviv </PERSON> said eight others were being detained for questioning. Fifteen more Arabs were questioned and freed overnight, he said. Among the casualties of the attack were two children. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, 8, lost both feet, and his brother, <PERSON> Yonathan </PERSON>, 2, was wounded in the abdomen, said officials at <LOCATION> Rambam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. Five other family members, including a 5-year-old sister, were slightly injured. The boys' father, <PERSON> Maryan </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>: `` I do n't know who threw -LRB- the bomb -RRB-, Jews or Arabs, but whoever threw it is below any level of humanity because whether there's a political problem or not, he directed the grenade, and I saw this, toward my children.'' <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurel </PERSON> said the attack appeared aimed at harming Jewish-Arab ties in a city that has become a symbol of coexistence. `` They will not succeed in their goal of upsetting Jewish-Arab relations,'' <PERSON> Gurel </PERSON> said in a statement. <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s population of 243,000 includes 20,000 Arabs who hold Israeli citizenship and many of whom live in mixed neighborhoods with Jews. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Palestinians shuttered stores and stayed home from work in a dozen major cities in a strike called by Moslem fundamentalists. The strike marks the 19th anniversary of the arson fire that ravaged the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, one of Islam's holiest sites. The fire was started by an Australian sheepshearer who was later deported. Hospital officials said 12 Palestinians were admitted Sunday to a hospital in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city with a population of 120,000. At least nine were shot during clashes with troops, but three from the Askar refugee camp on the city's outskirts were shot by unidentified men in civilian clothes, an Arab reporter said. The army said it knew of only three men being wounded. Troops maintained curfews on three refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and three in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> news reports said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspapers reported that an Israeli officer deliberately shot and killed a Palestinian inmate during a riot at the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> prison on Aug. 16. The army denied the report. The prison in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> houses about 2,500 inmates, most of whom have been sentenced to six months in prison without trial. The army said two prisoners were fatally shot when troops opened fire to stop stone-throwers. The newspaper quoted witnesses as saying a soldier shot <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the chest at point-blank range when the prisoner refused an order and then defiantly told the soldier, `` Go ahead, shoot me.''

 Someone broke into and ransacked an optometrist's office, then left a note chiding the eye doctor for being short-sighted and leaving the door unlocked, police said Sunday. `` You're pretty dumb to leave your back door open. Please in the future, do n't leave it open,'' the handwritten note said. `` In a world like today's, you ca n't trust anyone. So do n't be dumb.'' The Panorama City office was ransacked between 5 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday, when a janitor discovered the break-in, Sgt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> said. Some pairs of glasses were thrown around the office, and someone had drawn on posters with felt-tip markers, he said. Police did n't yet know if anything had been stolen. The address of the office was not released because the proprietor had not been notified.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is preparing to launch a surveillance satellite into low Earth orbit, giving it a potential advantage in any military confrontation with its neighbors in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Citing unidentified intelligence sources, the magazine said the Israelis plan first to launch an experimental satellite designed to last less than a month. If successful, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> then would put up a satellite with a life-span of about two years. The magazine said Israeli defense officials are divided over whether to launch the satellite as soon as possible, or to wait and avoid adding fuel to the region's arms race. The Israeli inner cabinet is expected to make a decision within the next few weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said. Last summer, the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> magazine reported that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had test-fired a medium-range missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The Time report said a second purpose of the launch was to test <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ability to launch a surveillance satellite.

 CHICAG0 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday he has `` no hesitancy'' about keeping <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate and declared he's ready to `` take the heat'' on the controversy over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military service. `` I've remained cool in this crisis because I've been there before,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a pool of reporters accompanying him on Air Force Two to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked to reporters soon after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for meetings with high-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides on his campaign plans. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has come under harsh criticism for using his wealthy family's influence to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rather than be drafted at the height of the Vietnam War. `` I want him out campaigning,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator appeals to young people and to women voters. Flying here from a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphatically denied there had been any consideration given in his campaign organization to asking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to step aside _ and said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had offered no such withdrawal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would return to the campaign trail in his own right `` as soon as he can get squared away ... he had n't even had a chance to get his staff together'' when the military controversy developed. `` He's been thrown into a hornet's nest, but, you know, I've been there,'' the vice president said `` I've got to take the heat. I made the decision. The buck stops right here. `` I have no hesitancy about it.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had donned an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cap and greeted citizen soldiers while saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had served Guard with `` pride and honor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he could not understand why news organizations are raising so many questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, adding, `` I do n't see that there's an enormous demand from the public to know his high school grades.'' As for reports that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had assistance in joining the guard from an employee of his grandfather's newspaper, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I had help from my dad, and I expect <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did. Is it that unusual that a parent would help his son?'' `` Some people burned their draft cards. Some went to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Some in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> turned in their medals. We could damage an entire generation here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> parted on the campaign trail at <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, the vice president told a crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` will be a good advocate of the things we believe.'' For the first time since the pair started joint appearances in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not comment publicly to the large throng of reporters that has been covering the campaign outings in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. On his arrival at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> wing of the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped out of his limousine and made a point of greeting men and women members of a Guard unit. He said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was `` a very honorable service'' and said that others `` ought not try to be making something wrong out of serving in that way.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jumped off a tractor-drawn tram on the grounds on the fairgrounds and went over to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> exhibit, and climbed up on a platform. He peered into the barrel of an unarmed TOW antitank missile launcher. Encouraged by people in the crowd, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> playfully aimed the weapon towards the platform holding the reporters and photographers. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has criticized the aggressive attempt by traveling reporters to ferret out <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s motives in joining the Guard. `` In him, we have a man, 41 years old, who did serve in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> with pride and honor,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He'll do well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, when asked how the senator would fare on the campaign trail. `` I do n't know that he has to learn anything -LRB- about campaigning -RRB-. He's got to get his act together, get the schedules going. This -LRB- the controversy -RRB- hit him out of a clear blue sky.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said campaign manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> along with `` a lot of our people'' to help <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> prepare for his solo campaign outings. `` It's a question of where he's going to go, how he's going to campaign and he'll do very, very well,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Campaign officials said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> likely would hit the trail beginning Wednesday, although they did not say where he would go. They did say it was possible <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be reunited with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> later in the week. Meanwhile, press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> sought to minimize increasing press scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s admission to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, in view of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s mediocre undergraduate grades `` The senator has widely conceded that he did not cut a wide academic swath, but he did want to go to law school,'' she said. `` He may have gotten in because he went down and talked ... and convinced -LRB- school officials -RRB- ... of the seriousness of his purpose and his motivation.'' Sitting at a picnic table while munching on a variety of ethnic foods, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed off questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s academic record. `` Do n't take a look at my lackluster performance,'' he told reporters who hovered nearby. `` I refuse to release my high school transcripts because I failed chemistry. I do n't want anyone to know that. ... I want to be a president that chemists can look up to.''

<HEAD>Advocates: Groups Erred In Planning Shelter System For Homeless</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan that led to the establishment of many of the nation's emergency shelters for homeless people was `` a major mistake'' and helped swell the ranks of the nation's homeless in recent years, experts said Sunday. The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates there are between 2 million and 3 million homeless people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Women and children make up about 60 percent. The homeless should have access to more affordable housing and assistance to ease dependency on crowded, understaffed shelters, according to those who participated in a seminar at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Social Problems. `` The three-tiered plan was a major mistake,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Task Force for the Homeless. `` It was much too conservative and allowed for a service institution that blames the victim.'' The plan was drawn up and embraced nationally by advocacy groups for the homeless in recent years. It called for providing crisis services in emergency shelters, helping homeless people re-establish their lives and supplying low-income housing for those who can live independently, said <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION>. But that wo n't work because many homeless people have turned the temporary shelters into `` a permanent living situation,'' she said. `` Shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of homelessness, their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless condition by keeping many in a transient state,'' she said. Social workers should move away from shelter-oriented services and toward serving as many people as possible at a low cost, Ms. <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said. Recruiting new businesses to improve employment chances and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws would be a good start, she added.

 `` The Last Emperor'' opened Sunday in the Chinese capital to packed theaters but moviegoers gave a muted reaction to the film about the end of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pre-communist royal dynasty. One woman, waiting for a bus after the movie, said, `` The beginning was good, very riveting, but the last part was too serious.'' She also said the scenes of a communist re-education camp were not realistic but did not elaborate. She declined to give her name. The film about the life of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last emperor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, will have its official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> premier Sept. 27. Italian director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, the film's two producers and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lone </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, will be invited to attend. Two <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> theaters on Sunday began showing a 10-day special run. The Chinese audiences, often noisy during movies, were usually quiet. But scenes of zealous Red Guards marching alleged counter-revolutionaries through the streets during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution drew chatter and laughter. Some viewers joined in the singing and chanting. The 49-cent ticket price, three times the usual cost, did not seem to affect sales for Sunday's showings. Most moviegoers who were questioned said they came to see why the film won nine Oscars, including the award for best picture, at the Academy Awards in April. After the showing, `` Pretty good'' and `` OK'' were typical comments. A few people said they went to see actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, who played the empress. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> is a Chinese actress who went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981. One man complained that `` using a foreign actor to depict <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> was hardly fitting.'' A college student praised the film as historically accurate and said he wanted to see it a second time. `` The Last Emperor,'' which opened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December, was to be released in Chinese theaters in June but that date was postponed. The <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve all foreign films shown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the time was needed to dub the film into Chinese. But there was speculation that officials might be unhappy with the film's treatment of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> history and that cuts were being made. The bureau denied that. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zongyue </PERSON>, an editor for <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who has seen both the original movie and the Chinese version several times, said minor cuts were made generally of scenes deemed unsuitable for children. Capital Theater Manager <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangyin </PERSON> said the responses of moviegoers were mixed. Some viewers said they wanted to see `` Last Emperor'' again, but others said it was n't nearly as good as a 30-part Chinese television series on <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, also called `` The Last Emperor'' and nationally broadcast earlier this year.

Baton-swinging police fired tear gas and charged the protesters with dogs about two hours after a chanting, clapping crowd began marching through the city. The march had dwindled to about 1,000 people when police moved in, beating at least two people and dragging others away. Waving Czechoslovak flags, the crowd began a march in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> after a rally where hundreds signed a petition calling for democracy, human rights, the abolition of censorship and the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Many chanted the name of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who as <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader instituted the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring'' reforms before Soviet-led troops invaded on Aug. 20-21, 1968. At least five people were detained at different sites Sunday, including prominent activist Jan Urban. It was not known if Urban, a member of a human rights group called Charter 77, was released. The crowd that left Wenceslas square was joined by thousands of onlookers and the march swelled to about 10,000. Police made no move to disperse the crowd until it had thinned and protesters tried to return to the square. Police charged and dispersed the crowd, but no reports of injuries were available. Reporters saw helmeted police beating at least two people and two others were dragged away after shouting `` Dubcek'' and `` Freedom.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a brief dispatch that `` groups of people attempted disturbing actions'' in Wenceslas Square. It was `` peaceful at the beginning. More prounounced attempts at provocation were recorded ... after the crowd moved to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and during a march through the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. ` The considerate and decisive action of the police prevented riots.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an estimated 500 demonstrators gathered in a central park. When they began chanting `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' police charged and dispersed the crowd. Several dozen people were taken away but the number of arrests was not known. About 100 demonstrators staged a second rally along <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Arbat shopping mall, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuyev </PERSON>, a member of an unsanctioned political party called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> He said police arrested an unspecified number of protesters. Before the march in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, a group calling itself Independent Peace Initiative earlier met in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and drew up a 10-point petition. Peace campaigner <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> read it as hundreds loudly applauded each point. <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> said the petition would be sent to Czechoslovak state, government and party leaders and the state-run media. At one point, a policeman passed through the tightly packed crowd and grabbed copies of the signed petitions. The crowd jeered and yelled `` Shame.'' Reporters saw police spraying mace into the face of at least one citizen. Earlier on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, 200 people walked behind two representatives of the Charter 77 movement, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanturkova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON>, who tried to lay flowers by the statue of King Wenceslas. Uniformed police pushed back the two activists and others who tried to lay flowers in memory of countrymen killed in street violence after the invasion. Plainclothes men swiftly gathered up flowers thrown at the monument as the crowd sang the Czech and Slovak national anthems and applauded. Miss <PERSON> Kanturkova </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Hradilek </PERSON> came to the square in place of three group spokesmen detained Saturday as they walked to the Soviet Embassy with an appeal to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to tell the truth about the 1968 invasion. A French reporter said one of the three, <PERSON> Bohumir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janat </PERSON>, told him that he and group member <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> were released late Saturday after a few hours in detention. An informed source said the third man, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, was freed Sunday in his home town of <LOCATION> Gottwaldov </LOCATION>. After the anthem singing, police detained at least two people and a third wearing a Czechoslovak flag on his jacket was seized an hour later. Outside a radio station, police checked the documents of eight people who tried to lay flowers there and detained at least one. One man whose documents were checked, <PERSON> Vlastimil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kula </PERSON>, 37, said he went to the square because `` it is the 20th anniversary of the act the nation ca n't agree with.'' When Aug. 21 dawned 20 years ago, this nation's 15.5 million people woke up stunned to realize that their communist allies had invaded to crush what official media call the danger of counterrevolution and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s cautious communist leadership, installed to crush some of the very innovations now favored in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, recently embarked upon carefully controlled economic reform and has allowed independent groups and cultural activists more leeway. But Sunday's heavy police presence indicated the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership will not tolerate renewed protests against the invasion. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reiterated Friday that the invasion was justified.

 An estimated 2,500 demonstrators held a peaceful rally Sunday inside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s City Hall to protest labor laws scheduled to go into effect next month. The rally, attended mainly by black workers and union leaders, was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the nation's largest labor federation. It called the rally to oppose the Labor Relations Amendment Bill that will take effect Sept. 1. Union leaders say the measure will make it more difficult to have legal strikes and gives employers greater legal powers to settle labor disputes. Some employer organizations also have expressed reservations about the bill, saying it could lead to more labor-management confrontations. Millions of black workers stayed away from their jobs for three days in June when the bill was being considered by the white-controlled government. Meanwhile, police said Sunday that five blacks were killed in townships around the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>. It said police fired on a group of blacks stoning a private house in <LOCATION> Hammersdale </LOCATION> township and three men were killed. A man was killed in the same area by a group of blacks and a man was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Mphumalanga </LOCATION> township, according to the brief police report. It gave no further details.

 The man who bought the lakefront home of former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is remodeling the $ 685,000 house and is hopeful its notoriety will die down. `` It's just a house and it happens to be a little famous,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said of the 10,266-square-foot house. A lot of curious people still stroll down his driveway to look at the house that once belonged to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was forced from the ministry in a sex and money scandal. Little evidence of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' taste will be left once the redecoration is complete, <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said.

The four-bedroom, five-bathrom home has a 36-foot-long swimming pool, a boat dock, a marble foyer, an exercise room and a music room. Some of the furniture and appliances were included in the sale, <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said, and he will keep most of the appliances, but the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' furniture is just not his taste. `` I looked at the house and it was just what I wanted,'' he said. `` I am going to make it into a very upbeat <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> look.''

 British troops prayed Sunday for eight fellow soldiers killed by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb, and authorities seized bomb-making equipment in the basement of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s largest hospital. Members of the First Battalion of the Light Infantry and their families remembered the dead at a private service at the army barracks in the town of <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, near where the bomb went off Friday 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Soldiers also prayed at the Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> barracks in <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the eight dead soldiers trained. Local residents placed two simple wreaths on a fence post near the bombing site. Meanwhile, 27 soldiers injured in Friday's blast remained in the hospital Sunday. Six were in serious condition, the army said. Two of the injured troops were in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where police and British soldiers seized the equipment used for making bombs, four handguns and ammunition in a basement Sunday. No explosives were found, and patients had not been in danger, said a city police official on condition on anonymity. Security forces have not linked the arms cache to a particular group, the spokesman said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up its bombing campaign against <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities in recent months. Friday's blast came 11 weeks after an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed six soldiers in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Friday's attack was the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s deadliest since 1982. It brought to 26 the number of British military deaths in the summer terror blitz. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. In Friday's attack, seven soldiers, ages 18 to 21, died when a bomb in a parked car blew up the unmarked bus carrying them back to their barracks from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where they had just arrived from furlough in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. An eighth died Saturday of his injuries.

 Actress <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was airlifted to a hospital in this western <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> city Sunday after her heartbeat became irregular. Miss <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 87, was visiting her son, actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, in Crested Butte, a <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> resort town about 10,000 feet above sea level, when she began feeling ill, a doctor said. `` I really feel it was just the altitude that was bothering her. But she was sent to Grand Junction to confirm whether or not she had a heart attack,'' Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullius </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` She had an irregular heartbeat and it could be secondary to altitude. `` We just flew her to Grand Junction.

The doctor said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was conscious and not in pain when he treated her. The silver-haired actress ended her theater career in 1971, after 66 years, because of allergies to dust that aggravated her chronic asthmatic bronchitis, but continued to work before the camera and was active in causes, including the rights of the aged.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday she would not resign but would continue governing this factious country because she had a covenant with the Filipino people and a `` contract with God.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made no direct reference to the Aug. 13 demand by Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> that she step down and call new presidential elections. But she told about 2,000 people at ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the slaying of her husband, opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, that forces bent on destabilizing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> were working against her. `` Every step we have taken toward progress has been challenged, particularly at this time of the year, by those determined to see this nation fail,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` But you and I shall not let it ...'' she added. `` For my mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.'' She added: `` For my mandate is with this nation, not with is enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.'' In a letter to the president, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> had accused her administration of incompetence and of failing to stem the 19-year Communist rebellion. Laurel offered to resign if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> did, but added that if she refused, he would remain vice president and join the opposition. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has so far not responded to Laurel in writing. Last week, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> met with opposition leaders to discuss forming a unified opposition party. But his call for a new election has failed to gain the support of major politicians. The next presidential election is set for May 1992. Laurel and opposition leaders have charged that the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration is rife with corruption. They have compared it to the final years in office of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was toppled by a civilian-military uprising on Feb. 25, 1986. The revolt culminated a wave of public outrage sparked by the Aug. 21, 1983, assassination of her husband. He was murdered while leaving a jet under military escort.

^Bush Says He'll Take the Heat Over Quayle Controversy</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday he'll `` take the heat'' over the controversy surrounding running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military service, a flap that one senior Republican predicted will linger for a while. Democrats claimed it all showed their ticket has more stature. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a pool of reporters as he flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has `` been thrown into a hornet's nest, but, you know, I've been there. I've got to take the heat. I made the decision. The buck stops right here.'' The vice president said he had `` no hesitancy'' about keeping <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the ticket despite the controversy over the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator using his wealthy family's influence to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. After arriving at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> airport Sunday afternoon <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopped out of his limousine and greeted men and women members of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit. He said theirs was `` a very honorable service'' and that others `` ought not try to be making something wrong out of serving in that way.'' A little later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaped off a tram on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> and walked over to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> exhibit, peering down the barrel of an unloaded antitank missile launcher before playfully turning the weapon on reporters. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said he and other campaign officials are `` convinced that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did absolutely nothing improper'' by seeking membership in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War. A day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself had called the issue a `` tempest in a teapot.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television show `` Face The Nation,'' said a review of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s background after questions were raised disclosed nothing new. He said taking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> off the ticket `` was never considered.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared together in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> early Sunday before the vice president went off to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a couple of days of private time to chart the course of a campaign born less than a week ago at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> taking Sunday off at home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was relaxing at his <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> farm. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, one of those <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> passed over in his vice presidential selection process, said Sunday he spoke with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> flap Saturday evening and `` he believes it's pretty much behind them.'' What does <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> think? `` I think it's going to last awhile,'' replied <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to the question put by an interviewer on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press.'' Questioned about how <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could be picked over more experienced and well-known senators, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he thought `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to go for the generational thing.'' The National Guard issue might not play well, he said. `` Right now I would guess there are number of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats who are going to remain undecided or maybe go the other way,'' he said. However, he said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign would allay those concerns as time goes on. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can `` still be very effective'' because of his expertise on certain issues, especially defense, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. House Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, also appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> program, said the question was not <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s service in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, but rather <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in choosing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as running mate over what he said were better qualified Republicans. `` Out of the 46 Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, I think most people would agree that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, at best, is 30th, or something like that,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. `` Why did <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pick <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? That's got to be the question. `` Is <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaylequalified </PERSON> to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't think he has the maturity. I do n't think he has had the experience. And for sure the one thing that we all look at, I do n't think he has shown the leadership over the years to do the job.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a good speech at the convention, `` The question really is whether or not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is capable to make the decisions when called upon,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` His first presidential decision was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first presidential decision was <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, on `` Face The Nation, `` echoed <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s sentiments. `` Is this the man who is best qualified to be vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' she asked. If not, she said, `` At that point the real issue is not <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his judgment, his decision to pass over some Republicans of real national stature to choose <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that his son did n't meet the academic requirements for <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, but he met the dean and `` talked his way in.'' Newspaper publisher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said that the candidate's family ties helped him get a job as an investigator for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s attorney general. The law school admissions dean, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Frandsen </PERSON>, was a Republican city judge in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Quayle-Pulliam </PERSON> family owns the local newspaper. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the newspaper that an executive who worked for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s late grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s largest newspapers, arranged an interview for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendack </PERSON>, then attorney general of the state <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> became chief investigator in the attorney general's consumer office and later administrative assistant to <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON>, then <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor

 A train brakeman battling a bout of stomach flu whistled `` Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' Sunday and emerged as the world's best warbler for the fourth time in the 11th annual International Whistle-Off. `` People ask me all the time how to whistle and all I say is ` pucker up and start blowing','' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, 57, a Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> brakeman from <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. `` I really think whistling is a God-given gift like opera singing,'' said <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, who topped the field of 30 contestants for the grand championship and a trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Whistlers from 15 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> competed. <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> also whistled `` Sweet Georgia Brown'' in capturing the title in the solo popular male division. The juggling and magic acts he performed while whistling `` Day at Fair'' earned him second in the novelty division. He whistled <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>' `` Hungarian Dance Number Five'' and placed third in the solo classical male division. <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON>, who also was the event's grand champion in 1979, 1980 and 1984, said he began whistling when he was 6 and `` practiced 40 years before getting on stage'' in 1977. `` I can hold notes and I've got good breath control,'' <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> said. `` But basically, I just whistle and have fun. A lot of it gets down to the shape of your mouth and I'm blessed to be a natural whistler.''

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday she would not resign but would continue governing this factious country because she had a covenant with the Filipino people and a `` contract with God.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made no direct reference to the Aug. 13 demand by Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> that she step down and call new presidential elections. But she told about 2,000 people at ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the slaying of her husband, opposition leader <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, that forces bent on destabilizing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> were working against her. `` Every step we have taken toward progress has been challenged, particularly at this time of the year, by those determined to see this nation fail,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` But you and I shall not let it ...'' she added. `` For my mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.'' She added: `` For my mandate is with this nation, not with is enemies. My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.'' In a letter to the president, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> had accused her administration of incompetence and of failing to stem the 19-year Communist rebellion. Laurel offered to resign if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> did, but added that if she refused, he would remain vice president and join the opposition. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has so far not responded to Laurel in writing. Last week, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> met with opposition leaders to discuss forming a unified opposition party. But his call for a new election has failed to gain the support of major politicians. The next presidential election is set for May 1992. Laurel and opposition leaders have charged that the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration is rife with corruption. They have compared it to the final years in office of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was toppled by a civilian-military uprising on Feb. 25, 1986. The revolt culminated a wave of public outrage sparked by the Aug. 21, 1983, assassination of her husband. He was murdered while leaving a jet under military escort. He had just flown home after three years self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A powerful earthquake rumbled through the mountains of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> before dawn Sunday, triggering landslides and floods, destroying houses and killing more than 400 people, officials and news reports said. More than 3,000 were injured in the quake, which seismologists called the deadliest to strike the Himalayan region since 1950. Indian officials said at least 125 people were killed and 2,000 injured in the eastern state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>. Government television put the number of dead at more than 300. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nepal </ORGANIZATION> said at least 281 people were killed in towns near the border, and Nepalese officials said more than 1,000 were injured. The quake also jolted parts of northern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of casualties or damage. The <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said the quake occurred at 4:40 a.m. and measured 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The quake lasted for about one minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour, observatory director H.N. <PERSON> Srivastava </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Srivastava </PERSON> said the temblor was centered about 40 to 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION>, a town of about 800,000 in <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>. The location puts the epicenter almost on the India-Nepal border. Officials said most of the deaths occurred in <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Munger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Madhubani </LOCATION> districts. More than 25,000 houses in those areas were destroyed, they said. V.K. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, a deputy secretary in the <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> government, predicted the death toll would rise because many people were seriously injured. Landslides knocked out communication links on both sides of the border, preventing officials from obtaining information about casualties or damage from the remote, hardest hit areas. `` The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> capital. The monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually continue through September, also were hampering rescue operations. More than 50 villages were flooded after the quake shifted embankments. In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Upadhyaya </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, said at least 500 people were injured and thousands of houses collapsed from the quake's impact. But other officials said later Sunday that more than 1,000 were hurt. `` Most of -LRB- the victims were -RRB- buried alive under collapsed houses,'' said <PERSON> Indra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON>, a social worker involved in the rescue operations at <LOCATION> Dharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bazar </LOCATION>, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border. In the ancient township of <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, about 11 miles south of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Assa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Basakala </PERSON> surveyed the damage. `` The Germans came and helped restore most of this town to its original, traditional splendor'' in 1960, he said. `` I do n't know how we'll rebuild now.'' Officials in both countries were rushing medical teams, clothes and other relief material to the disaster aras. Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> planned to visit the region Monday to survey the damage. Most of the victims were asleep in their beds when the quake struck. Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and people ran screaming from their homes. `` My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. <PERSON> Rudra </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION>. `` My dogs began barking and I ran out of the house.'' The quake also was felt in the heavily populated states of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. Reports of injuries came from the Darjeeling district of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, the news agency said, but no deaths were reported. The Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> news agency said 17 children were killed in <LOCATION> Darbhanga </LOCATION> town, which is about 560 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, when a school hostel caved in. In the neighboring <LOCATION> Madhubani </LOCATION> district, a river jumped its banks after the quake shifted embankments and flooded nearly 50 villages, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials said at least 45 people died in the district, but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses. The <LOCATION> Bhootahi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> continued to rise more than 12 hours after the quake, and the army was alerted to the possibility that troops might be sent to help rescue operations, the officials said. The Richter scale measures the energy released by an earthquake as gauged by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage. The worst quake on record in the Indian subcontinent occurred in 1935, when at least 30,000 people were killed in <LOCATION> Quetta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in what is now <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In 1950, an estimated 1,530 were killed in the Himalayan foothills of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s deadliest earthquake occurred in 1934. More than 10,700 people died.

 While the Republicans almost certainly will be blessed with a buoyant economy through Election Day, inflation and rising interest rates could shove the country into a recession as early as next spring, some economists are warning. A few analysts are forecasting a downturn for next year, and many who are n't say it will take luck to avoid a recession. Ironically, one of the things that has them worried is that economic growth has been so robust lately.

 The bartender's dreaded cry of `` last orders'' will not ring out in English pubs Monday afternoon for the first time since World War I. Instead, thanks to new laws that permit all-day drinking, pubs that open at 11 a.m. can continue serving beer and spirits until closing time at 11 p.m. `` We're hoping for a big crowd,'' said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, assistant manager of the Hog In The Pound pub near the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> shopping district. `` We're stacked up -LRB- with beer -RRB-.

Under the old system, pubs were forced to close from 3 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. The bartender's warning at 2:50 p.m. created a rush for one last pint, and 10 minutes later, to the cry of `` time, gentlemen, please,'' the fun was over.

 Tune in this week for the next episode in the family feud over R.P. <ORGANIZATION> Scherer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Stockholders have been pitted between the capsule maker's largest shareholder, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, and her estranged husband, <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> executive <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, in a proxy battle that peaked at the company's annual meeting last Wednesday `` I feel like over the last few weeks I've been watching nothing more than a live episode of ` Dynasty,' and frankly, I think it's pathetic,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a shareholder and former vice president Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, daughter of the company's late founder, was seeking three board seats for her faction, whose mission is to sell the company. Not surprisingly, management has touted the not-for-sale position. Results of the vote are expected when the company reconvenes its annual meeting at 10 a.m. EDT this Wednesday. Yet even if directors backing a sale are elected, analyst <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulis </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Roney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` You go back to the basic, fundamental issue here'' _ and that is, he said, does anyone want to buy the company. <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s stock is trading around $ 26 a share, sharply higher than the $ 16-a-share selling price of a year ago. But analysts attribute the increase to the boardroom pathos, which has put the spotlight on the company. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Obstfeld </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he doubted any purchase offer would approach the $ 26-a-share level. `` I do n't see how anybody could pay that much,'' he said. Analysts note that the biggest profits in the pharmaceutical industry come from companies that produce new products; <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> is engaged only in packaging. `` I think it is a fine company in and of itself, but as a possible acquisition for a drug company or chemical company, it does n't make sense,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, supported by her brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, thinks this is an opportune time to sell the company because there is no guarantee <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s recent record annual sales of $ 290.7 million and earnings of $ 15.1 million will continue. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> and I watched our father build this company. He made our mother and their children partners in it nearly 50 years ago ... and I believe he would have heartily endorsed a sale,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and her brother control about 38 percent of the company. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s president and chief executives officer, said there have been no offers and stressed that shareholders would profit most if the company remained independent. He said he is trying to prevent the dispute from becoming a distraction for <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s 2,800 employees. `` I'd rather not refer to them as damage control measures,'' he said after last week's stockholder meeting. `` We've tried to contain the diversion to as few people as possible.'' Some stockholders say the company will be damaged whatever the outcome the family dispute, which saw Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> file for divorce weeks after the board rejected her sale proposal. `` What we are really witnessing here is the wounding of a unique and special company,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told about 200 people at last week's meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> says she just wants what is best for stockholders. Four months ago Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> rejected a suggestion by some directors that the company pay a one-time dividend that would benefit her and her brother, in return for reducing their voting power. `` I think that's the kind of deal I'd try to cut right now,'' <PERSON> Gulis </PERSON> said.

The name, she said, is meant to convey the Catskills' more active image as a center for sports and recreation. `` I do n't think we'll ever get away from that ethnic image and I do n't think we want to,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Some of the things we like about the image are the sense of tradition, a sense of family and a warmth that you do n't get from a chain hotel.'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutsher </PERSON>, for example, still prowls around the huge resort in <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION> his family has run since 1907. Nevertheless, many of the 500 resorts that once dotted the area have folded or converted to other uses; about a dozen giants now handle the bulk of the visitors. Like many resort areas close to big cities, the <LOCATION> Catskills </LOCATION> _ about a two-hour ride from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ began to fade as a tourist destination in recent years.

It was a case of adapt or die, and the Catskills did a better job than areas like the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, travel industry analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>. `` To some extent, the times are changing back toward the <LOCATION> Catskills </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` You have a rise in dual working couples. That segment has money, but what they do n't have is time. More likely a two-career couple wants to take three days off and go someplace nearby and relax and have a lot of activities there.'' That's why `` CatskilLand's'' color brochure shows a young couple whacking a tennis ball, dipping into a swimming pool and hitting a golf ball. Skiiers and other weekend athletes are most welcome. Resort owners continue to use their imaginations to draw guests. <PERSON> Grossinger </PERSON>'s hosted the first `` singles only'' weekend back in 1962; a concept updated with an'80s twist at the <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> resort, which publishes its own newsletter with personal advertisements. Hotels also have recently sponsored special weekends for single parents and for infertile couples, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The Catskills' crowds also are n't as predictable as they used to be. The families who still come to the Catskills for their bar mitzvahs now room side by side with corporate executives on retreats or training seminars, <PERSON> Kutsher </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> travel shows, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she's known as `` the golf lady'' among Japanese tourists who enjoy the relatively uncrowded Catskills links. Many of the large hotels are also expanding their services to include condominiums offered for use by time-sharing vacationers. While the Catskills can claim a revival _ <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said her office had 101,000 inquiries from tourists in 1986 compared to 24,000 in 1980 _ it ca n't say the comeback is complete. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s Hotel, one of the top resorts, filed for bankruptcy last month, although the hotel remains open. <PERSON> Grossinger </PERSON>'s, once the king of the Catskills, has been closed since 1986, although its new owners promise a remodeled resort will debut in 1989. `` It hurt us a lot individually because we were friends with these people,'' <PERSON> Kutsher </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Grossinger </PERSON>'s closing. `` But <PERSON> Grossinger </PERSON>'s will rise out of the ashes.'' If it does, its new owners hope it will typify the new Catskills. The newly named <PERSON> Grossinger </PERSON>'s Resort and <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> will contain some non-kosher restaurants and townhouses, said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, the resort's general manager.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spends millions of dollars to improve education in this country, but the company's name will be missing from the latest attack on the high school dropout problem A series of 30-second television and radio spots and newspaper and magazine ads will be released nationwide this week and be identified as public-service announcements from two not-for-profit organizations: the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and the Advertising Council in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> donated materials and services for the ads but chose to remove its name from them, remain anonymous and give credit to the two not-for profit groups _ an action described as unique and unprecedented by both councils and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dropout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is an excellent public awareness program about the dropout crisis in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smink </PERSON>, the center's executive director. `` When more parents, communities and corporations learn about the potential we are losing, we are more likely to get them involved in projects to keep youngsters in school,'' <PERSON> Smink </PERSON> said. The goal of the campaign _ to be kicked off Monday at a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> news conference _ is to help reduce government statistics showing that 682,000 students _ an average of 3,789 daily _ disappeared from their classrooms during the 1985-86 school year. `` The figures staggered us, and we decided to expand a program that we've had in place about a year,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for corporate communications <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> had previously launched an anti-dropout campaign in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, using all media to emphasize the importance of a high school diploma. Educators in both states reported the campaign had an impact on youngsters who saw the advertising. The idea was n't new for <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, which has distributed at least $ 10 million in the past five years in scholarships and college endowments. The total does not include money spent in other fields of education by <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. `` We approached the Advertising Council ... and asked if it would be interested in running the program nationally, like the ones it did on Smokey the Bear and drinking and driving,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. There was one hitch. `` The council must have a non-profit organization as a sponsor,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> explained. But Ashland found one in the Council of State Governments. All material that <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> had used in its two-state drive was donated to Doe-Anderson Advertising of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> for use in the national campaign. The agency's services also were donated. `` Our logo was stripped from the advertisements and replaced with that of the two councils,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s director of advertising and communications One of two tapes going to television stations depicts a depressed youngster sitting in a corner of his garage. A few feet away, an expensive sports car rests on cinder blocks. The narrator explains that `` two years ago, this car was the most important thing in <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>'s life. He spent every spare dime he had on it. He even quit high school to get a job so he could have the hottest ride in town. `` Today, the job is gone,'' the narrator continues. `` The car does n't work anymore and, without a high school diploma, neither does <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>. `` Winners never quit. Stay in school,'' the ad concludes. The second tape depicts a teen-age mother clutching an infant. She tells the audience: `` Making ends meet has n't been easy with three of us at home. Jobs are pretty scarce around here, especially since neither my husband nor me finished school. `` But it's going to be different for this one. He's going to stay in high school if I have to tie him to his chair. Sometimes, I wish someone had done me that way.'' The tape ends with this plea: `` Stay in school. Someone's future could depend on it.'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> estimated it will cost <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> about $ 50,000 for mailing the ads to the media. `` The packages will contain a brief summary of how the project came about, but this is the only recognition we will receive.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dropout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director, said, `` There are many, many reasons why kids give up on education. Any project that attempts to keep them from becoming a statistic has to be a plus.'' <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said studies have shown many girls cite pregnancy and marriage as their reasons for abandoning education plans while boys tend to blame their dislike for school. Both groups also mention economic reasons, <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> said. Dropout rates are higher among single-parent and lower-income families, he added. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s dropout rate has been declining, and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s commercials, which began in August 1987, have been a factor, said Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, director of pupil attendance in the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> In the 1983-84 school year, there were 14,224 dropouts in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, but that number shrank to 9,633 for 1986-87. `` Those commercials have to get part of the credit,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. Businessmen who saw the ads came up with suggestions to help dropouts, and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> now has more residents going into the General Education Diploma program than in past years, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` And for the first time in our history, people are passing in greater numbers than those who are quitting school,'' he said.

<HEAD>Seed Treatment Being Developed For Corn Borers; Still 2 Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agricultural researchers in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> are reporting some success in using seeds pretreated with an insecticide to fight European corn borers, pests the government estimates cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers $ 400 million a year in damage and control expenses. Pretreating seeds with a thiodicarb solution before planting has been found as effective in controlling corn borers as any spray now on the market, yet is more economical and appears to be safer to the environment, said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s Corn Insects Lab in <LOCATION> Ankeny </LOCATION>. But the process is n't ready for farm use yet. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said the treatment is in its third year of tests and that another year of research is planned. `` We're interested in learning why it is effective in some hybrids and not in others,'' he said. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> also said researchers want to know if the mechanical action of mixing the seeds with the chemical solution affects seed quality or influences the action of insecticides. In addition, the chemical seed treatment has yet to be approved for commercial use by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and its <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> developer, <ORGANIZATION> Gustafson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the process is still two years away from the marketplace. Researchers also have been experimenting with natural controls of corn borers through the interaction of an insect, the green lacewing; and a microbe, Nosema pyrausta. The lacewing eats corn borer eggs and larvae, and the microorganism infects larvae and borer eggs with a disease that is fatal to the borer and most other insects, but not the lacewing, according to the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because most insecticides that kill the corn borer indirectly kill the microorganism, researchers will try next to determine how farmers can maintain natural Nosema pyrausta populations with tilling practices, crop management and less pesticide,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reports. In the seed treatment, seeds are mechanically tumbled in a solution of the insecticide thiodicarb before planting. As the corn grows, the chemical is absorbed throughout the plant's stalks and leaves and the insect feeding on the plant dies, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> says. Corn borers cause their crop damage in their worm or larvae stage before maturing to adult moths. There are two to three generations to each growing season, according to <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. The larvae enters the plant and causes damage by eating through conductive tissues, interrupting the flow of nutrients. If it enters a corn stalk or ear, it weakens the plant and makes it susceptible to wind damage. Because the insect is on the plant's surface for only a short period of time before tunneling, it is especially difficult to combat with a spray, says <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` This is why a systematic or seed treatment is so encouraging,'' he says. Thiodicarb already is being used as a corn rootworm insecticide that is sprayed just before insect infestation, and <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said it was routinely evaluated as part of research attempts to find materials that are environmentally safer and more effective. Through early tests, researchers found the lowest concentrations of chemicals that proved effective against corn borers. `` Depending on the strain of corn, we can achieve as good a control with seed treatment as with conventional technology and it is more economical,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said, controlling 70 percent to 80 percent of the insect population. He also said the seed treatment puts less pesticide in the environment and has no known side effects. In spraying, 80 percent of the insecticide misses the target area, he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Knake </PERSON>, northern regional manager for research and development for <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, said his company is developing the chemical for seed treatment use for the international company <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION>, which is registering such use of thiodicarb with the EPA. He estimated the treatment would cost farmers a couple of dollars an acre. <PERSON> Knake </PERSON> said a simple mixer is being developed for farm use so that farmers need not come in contact with the chemical while treating seeds. He says the chemical breaks down so rapidly in the soil that it is environmentally safe. While many details need to be worked out, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> anticipates selling the insecticide for on-farm treatment, leaving it up to farmers to decide how much of their seed to treat and saving seed companies from investing in large stocks of treated seeds, <PERSON> Knake </PERSON> says.

<HEAD>Armtek Reports Negotiations with Third Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has rejected a $ 550 million buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says it is negotiating with a third party interested in buying the plastics and chemicals company. The announcement Friday came one day after Mark IV sweetened its offer for all of <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>'s stock to $ 44 a share from its original $ 40-a-share bid. Armtek's board, which rejected <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>'s original share as inadequate, has not responded to the latest offer. The company said it informed the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that negotiations with the third party `` may be dependent upon future actions of Mark IV Industries with respect to the amended offer.'' Armtek earlier said it would consider a third-party acquisition, and in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, the company said it was also considering recapitalization proposals. Investors apparently expect bidding for Armtek to continue. The company's stock rose $ 1 a share to $ 46.50 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Friday. Armtek is facing four class action suits in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where it is incorporated, from shareholders who charge the company's directors are trying to thwart the Mark IV takeover attempt and have n't satisfactorily explored the offer One suit claims <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>'s directors have `` embarked upon a course of action designed to entrench themselves in the management and control of <LOCATION> Armtek </LOCATION> and to protect and enhance their personal financial benefits'' at the expense of shareholders. Armtek, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is a supplier of engineered drive and heat exchange systems, modules and components and specialty polymers. It had $ 1.2 billion in sales last year. Two month ago, <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION> sold its largest unit, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to the Italian tire maker <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> for $ 197 million, capping a corporate restructuring. Mark IV, based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, produces professional audio, technical and aerospace products.

<HEAD>Iran Plans to Repair Oil Facilities Hit In War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will repair vital oil facilities battered in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at `` maximum speed'' as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Nation-sponsored cease-fire proves to be durable, Oil Minister <PERSON> Golamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> says. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> as saying Saturday <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> will also go ahead with major oil industry projects to boost exports, refining capacity and exploration and expand its energy industry. Rebuilding its oil industry, particularly its seven existing refineries which were badly hit, is one of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s top priorities now that the shooting has stopped. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said the Iranians want to bolster oil exports as quickly as possible to fund the massive task of reconstruction. Before the cease-fire, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s government had projected oil earnings of around $ 9 billion for this year. But weak oil prices were expected to reduce that figure. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is currently producing around 2.3 million barrels of oil a day, the output quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Its current export level is an estimated 1.7 million barrels a day, despite <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> efforts to choke <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s economic lifeline. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s powerful air force concentrated much of its bombing offensive on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil facilities and tankers during the 8-year-old war. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said a new oil loading terminal at <LOCATION> Gavaneh </LOCATION> in the northern end of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> began operations soon after the gulf war cease-fire took effect Saturday. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said the big refinery at <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province, put out of action early in the war, will be rebuilt and expanded into `` one of the most sophisticated refineries of its kind.'' The refinery, with a capacity of 630,000 barrels a day, was the biggest in the world before it was knocked out by the Iraqis. The minister said another major refinery at <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> was now operating at its pre-war capacity of around 200,000 barrels a day after being bombed 15 times during the conflict. He did not mention the other refineries that were bombed. Earlier this year, Western experts estimated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s overall refinery capacity of 700,000 barrels a day had been reduced by more than one-third because of war damage. That forced the Iranians to import unprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation fuel and kerosene, from abroad. <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will push ahead with plans to build a new oil refinery with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day and a $ 1.5 billion petrochemical complex at the western city of <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION>. The Iranians have also announced plans to build two other smaller refineries in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the port of <PERSON> Taheri </PERSON>, midway down the gulf near offshore oil and gas fields.
