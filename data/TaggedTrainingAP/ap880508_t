<HEAD>Social Democrats Win Majority in Schleswig-Holstein Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained a firm victory in <LOCATION> Schleswig-Holstein </LOCATION> state Sunday, ending 38 years of rule by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. The special election was called after a `` dirty-tricks scandal'' rocked the state government last year. <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON>, leader of the state's Social Democrats, and his supporters had failed to win a majority in elections last September. But on Sunday, projections said the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> won 54 percent of the vote, assuring the party of 46 of the 74 seats in the legislature and that <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON> would be governor. The Christian Democrats were projected to receive about 33 percent, a loss of eight percent from September. <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON> was the target of a smear campaign last year involving allegations of improper sexual conduct. The campaign was blamed on then-Gov. <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON>, who was found dead in a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> hotel in October. Authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide. Projected results also showed the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the state's coalition government, had failed to receive the necessary five percent of the vote to stay in the legislature and lost its four seats. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Sunday night that the Social Democrats' victory would not negatively affect his conseravative coalition in the federal government with the Free Democrats. He attributed the Social Democrats' victory to the <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> affair. `` We went into the election from an unusually difficult position,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Last September, neither party could win enough seats to form a majority and elect a new governor. <PERSON> Barschel </PERSON> remained in office but then resigned when one of his aides disclosed details about the smear campaign against <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON> in late September. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had entered <PERSON> Heiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, the state's justice minister, to run against <PERSON> Engholm </PERSON> in Sunday's balloting

 Build a better cage for an egg to crash in and the world may not beat a path to your door, but it wo n't scramble your eggs, either. And it could help your physics grade at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrebonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, says physics teacher <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose 75 students at Friday's Egg Drop Competition used principles of mass, inertia, acceleration _ and toothpicks. The idea: build toothpick frames to cradle an egg during a 20-foot free fall, distribute the shock of a crash-landing and keep the egg from breaking. More than six dozen eggs did n't make the grade, including <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s, which splattered when its shapeless case hit the ground and smashed into, ah, toothpicks. `` I got the design from my friend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It worked for him. But I changed it up a little. I guess I should have stuck with the original design.'' Sixteen-year-old junior <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Portier </PERSON>'s egg made it through its first drop into the center of a spherical array of interconnected triangles. `` Everyone was dropping theirs and it was flipping over and breaking,'' he said. `` I used symmetry so the weight was distributed evenly.'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledet </PERSON>, 17, a senior, was less systematic. Her project looked like a bent soda can with a crown on top. Nonetheless, it worked. On <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s second drop, the ball began to roll. It bounced off the pavement and the egg began to ooze. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>'s egg survived a second drop with a cracked shell, but the egg stayed inside. `` Well,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, `` it looks like it's going to be easy to distribute the awards.''

 A month before he killed himself, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> painted a portrait in blue of his innkeeper's young daughter. The girl, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>, 13, was on the terrace of the cafe in <LOCATION> Auvers </LOCATION>, a village outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, when the artist returned from the fields, his hands pressed to the bullet wound in his stomach. Two days later, July 29, 1890, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> died. He was 37 years old. On Wednesday, `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>'' will offered for sale at an auction of impressionist and modern paintings. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, the auction house, estimates that it will fetch more than $ 15 million. Experts say interest in the portrait is keen in part because of the story behind it. The adolescent girl who posed for the painting said in an essay published in 1956 that she considered it `` somewhat of a disappointment'' at first. But in her later years, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> said she finally came to appreciate its insight into her character. Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> described <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, who lived at her father's inn during the last 2 -LCB- months of his life, as a disciplined artist and `` a soft and calm'' man who always smoked a pipe and enjoyed playing with her little sister. She also recalled the last two days of the artist's life during which he slowly succumbed to the fatal bullet. A doctor came to dress the wound, police officers arrived to investigate the suicide and the artist's brother <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> arrived running from the train station, his face `` distorted by grief,'' she wrote. The portrait being auctioned Wednesday is one of three versions van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> painted. When last offered for sale, in 1980 at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, it brought $ 1.98 million from an anonymous buyer. Last year, three of <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s paintings fetched record multimillion - dollar prices that shocked the art world The artist sold almost nothing during his lifetime. In March 1987, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' sold for $ 39.9 million at <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a Japanese firm, <ORGANIZATION> Yasuda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Three months later, `` The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $ 20.2 million, also at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> It was bought by an unidentified collector living in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Then in November, history was made when <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Irises'' _ a richly-colored composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a single white iris _ sold at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for $ 53.9 million to an anonymous buyer. It was the highest price paid at auction for any painting. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewald </PERSON>, the author of `` Post-Impressionism: From van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>,'' has said of `` Irises'': `` If a museum could have one painting by <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, that's what it should get.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s senior vice president, said he did n't think `` Portrait of <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON>'' would bring anywhere near the price paid for `` Irises.'' The special appeal of the portrait, aside from the painting itself, is its link to <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s last days, said <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>. In the painting, <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON>, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands folded demurely in front of her. `` He observed her very deeply, and when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON> said. He used `` brief flashing strokes'' and `` astonishing'' color; the background is `` almost an electric blue, a night blue,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>, who died in 1965 at age 88, had written: `` I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait; it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to life.'' But she also told an interviewer, `` <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> gave the first of his three versions of the portrait to the <PERSON> Ravoux </PERSON> family. More lifelike and detailed than the version up for auction, it is now in a private collection in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. A third version that shows only the face and whose colors are less brilliant is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soap opera actors say their characters have started speaking `` See <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> run,'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> is actually tired of time off and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> has taken up gardening as a scriptwriters strike enters week nine. Talks are suspended between the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> following the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s walkout March 7 over residuals and creative control. And there's no relief in sight, with producer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, who's also a member of the guild, saying things could drag on until January. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> is a very militant union,'' Academy Award-winning writer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taradash </PERSON> said Friday. `` We believe in what we believe.'' <PERSON> Taradash </PERSON>, a former guild president and former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike forced him to stop work on a nearly completed script about Polish labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. A sequel to the movie `` Annie'' also reportedly has been orphaned by the strike. `` Annie II,'' planned for a Christmas release, could n't get final touches made on its script. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which had hoped for a comeback in the fall after an unprecedented third-place finish this season, announced April 28 that it would push back the start of the new season from early Septeber to late October at the earliest. Producers claim the strike has cost the industry more than $ 15 million in lost jobs and production time, with about 1,400 clerical workers, cast and crew members laid off. The union struck when producers wanted to reformulate residual payments for hour-long television shows sold into syndication. Producers claim the shows are not selling well. Writers also want an increase of residuals from foreign markets, and more control over changes in their scripts. After nine weeks of reruns, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> returns Wednesday, writing his own monologue and otherwise ad-libbing his one-hour <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s contract allowing him generous time off has been the subject of `` Tonight Show'' joking from time to time. But the strike-forced vacation became no laughing matter, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, with longtime workers in his production company facing layoffs. Through a spokesman, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said that he was frustrated with efforts to reach an independent contract with the guild that would permit his scriptwriters to return. Talks with <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and at least 80 other independent producers are continuing. Scriptwriters voted April 14 not to grant independent contracts until it had a number of them in hand to avoid the divisiveness of only a few members returning to work. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON>, a member of the guild negotiating committee, said Friday that it was possible the membership `` may decide to move ahead and sign independent contracts this month.'' Meanwhile, the daytime soap operas have continued production. `` Scab scripts ai n't fun,'' said actress <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> on `` General Hospital.'' `` They make our days long and hard. They're illiterate,'' she said Wednesday as she walked a picket line with the guild. `` You have to continue,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Balme </PERSON>, one of the show's producers `` You owe it to the audience and to the network,'' he said, adding: `` We miss -LRB- the writers -RRB-. We want them back.'' The writing is `` getting to look like ` See <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> run,''' said actress <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCary </PERSON> of `` Days of Our Lives.'' Labor-management relations can be unusual in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Striking scriptwriter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goethals </PERSON> said he is surviving on tuna fish sandwiches and loans from friends, who also happen to be producers. Producer <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, honors the strike and stays away from his typewriter. `` Since I was a writer first, I'm not going to scab during the strike,'' <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> said. But he feels a conflict. `` I do n't think it's going to settle on the Writers Guild terms no matter what they think. I think it could go on to January if the wrong set of philosophies get used ... if they keep saying the companies are getting fat.'' Like many other producers, <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> has cut paychecks in half as a means of keeping on staff. <ORGANIZATION> Cannell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> turns out such television series as `` Hunter,'' `` The A-Team,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Hardcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'' and `` The Rockford Files.'' Meanwhile, `` Moonlighting'' star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> has taken up gardening. His ABC-TV series shut down early because of a lack of scripts. Though he's not at work, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> still has his problems. `` I'm having a lot of trouble with snails,'' <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said recently as he surveyed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons.

 A retired Argentine general arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reportedly has been sent back to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> Sunday to face murder charges but a police official here could not confirm his arrival. Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had acknowledged ordering the 1977 arrest of publisher <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. It said he made the statement Saturday before he was extradited from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to face 39 murder charges in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Federal Police Chief Juan Angel Pirker, questioned by newsmen in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> about the report, said: `` Officially, I know nothing.'' A <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Pagina </ORGANIZATION> 12, reported in its Sunday edition that <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had been `` expected to arrive this morning'' at the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Ezeiza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. But it said strict security measures in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` made it impossible to verify whether <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> did depart or on what flight, although it was certain that he left the -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> -RRB- country jail for the airport yesterday -LRB- Saturday -RRB- at 10:30 am. local time.'' In a legal deposition, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> discussed his role in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military government during its `` dirty war'' against suspected subversives in the 1970s, The Los Angelest Times reported. The ex-general was interviewed Friday and Saturday by <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeper </PERSON>, working on behalf of plaintiffs seeking damages in federal court for victims of the Argentine junta. The junta has been blamed for the deaths of thousands of people. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 64, said he ordered <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON>'s arrest after a subordinate presented him with accusations that the publisher was `` friends with a man who owned a bank that funded guerrillas,'' the Times quoted the attorney as saying. It was believed to be the first time <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> had acknowledged his role in the arrest of <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON>, who described his imprisonment and torture in the 1981 book `` Prisoner Without A Name, Cell Without A Number.'' The newspaper quoted Ms. <PERSON> Hoeper </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> `` knew <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON> was being interrogated. He said he listened to a tape-recording of an interrogation ...'' The military confiscated <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON>'s newspaper, La Opinion, which campaigned against the junta's anti-Semitic policies. <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON> spent 29 months in jail and under house arrest before being expelled to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where he became a citizen. <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> last year and has received $ 5 million from the government as compensation for the loss of his newspaper. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> commanded the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> from 1976 to 1979. He fled the country after a civilian government took over in 1983 and was arrested in January 1987 south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where he was living under an assumed name. A panel of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s civilian government has said at least 9,000 people disappeared during the nine-year rule by the military, including 5,000 in the region where <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> was commander.

 Some kids call it the `` grocery-store school'' and some parents call it a godsend. It's a baby-sitting service at the supermarket that lets parents in peace, and leaves more room in the cart for groceries. `` It's definitely helpful, especially when a mother has only two hands and two children and -LRB- is -RRB- trying to grocery shop,'' said 35-year-old <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfearn </PERSON>, who drives 17 miles from <LOCATION> Herrin </LOCATION> to shop at the Country Fair store in <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>. `` It's terrific,'' she said. Located at the front of the Country Fair store, the baby-sitting center has a color TV, a video cassette recorder, a 55-gallon aquarium, two bulletin boards, five bean bags, five plastic trucks and cars and stuffed animals. But if junior still gets bored, there's a 60-piece set of wooden building blocks, a xylophone, an Etch-a-Sketch, a toy telephone and a toy cash register. Safety scissors, glue and paint brushes, crayons, markers and paper complete the picture. The 18-by-16-foot area is a separate room from the store. It has brown carpeted floors and its walls are decorated with drawings by the children. Big windows allow parents to check in on their youngsters while they shop. `` My biggest problem is trying to get the kids to leave on time,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON>, 23, coordinator of the <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> center. `` They like to go to grocery-store school _ some of the kids call it that.'' The child-care center opened in October and entertained its 6,000 th youngster this past week `` I've had a lot of positive comments from mothers, from customers,'' said store manager <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmutz </PERSON>. `` I've had a lot of older mothers tell me we should've done this 20 years ago.'' `` The kids enjoy themselves more so than they enjoy grocery shopping,'' said 32-year-old <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsh </PERSON> shortly after picking up her year-old daughter at the center. A minimum $ 25 purchase at the store entitles parents to up to two hours of free child care. After two hours, there's a $ 5-an-hour charge. To ensure safety, the same person who checks a child in must check him out, and parents must remain on the store premises while the child is at the center. Children from age six months to six years are accepted. The idea came from <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, owner of the five Country Fairs in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> area. All but one offer the baby-sitting service.

 The people who moved onto the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranch </LOCATION> late in 1985 made friends easily. Nobody in this rural area where a man's background is his own business questioned their claim to have bought the ranch with an inheritance. But the federal government alleges that the <LOCATION> Atoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ranch north of <LOCATION> Stringtown </LOCATION> was a cover for laundering more than $ 1 million in proceeds from international drug trafficking by claiming the money came from cattle sales. Federal authorities also allege the isolated 2,889-acre property, since renamed the Junior Ranch, was bought as a refuge for <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Subias </PERSON>, a Mexican national wanted for questioning in the torture slaying of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, the killings of nine Venezuelan national guardsmen and the slaying of a Mexican federal police officer. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was arrested April 1 in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is jailed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Although federal officials now say they had been investigating the southeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> ranch for two years, the lid started coming off when two Texans stumbled onto a nearby marijuana-growing operation in August. They accused the owner of that ranch of abduction and details started emerging at the subsequent trial. `` If he does n't bother you, then why bother him? Just because they came in with a lot of money?'' said <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gammon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> clerk. When the Mexicans bought the ranch, it was viewed as a logical investment of their money. `` They told us they inherited it. We believed them and we welcomed them to the community,'' said <LOCATION> Atoka </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>. `` We are still in shock.'' Residents knew <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> as <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>. People interviewed last week said he was a model citizen who made friends easily because of his gentel ways. `` They were planting feed, not dope,'' said a businessman who would talk to a reporter only if his name were not used. `` They came here to make it their home.'' <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> drove a hard bargain and wrote checks for purchases rather than paying cash, the businessman said. Most big-ticket items were financed. `` Does that sound like they were laundering money?'' he asked. But residents reported to be closely associated with <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> now deny knowing him well. People who attended parties at the ranch threaten lawsuits if their names are mentioned in connection with <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, 42, originally was arrested in 1985 in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> with Mexican drug king <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> is awaiting trial in the 1985 slaying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DEA agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was sent to jail in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, to stand trial for the slaying of a Mexican federal agent. But he escaped in October 1985 after bribing his jailers, according to documents filed by <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents. Two months before his escape, a group of Mexicans negotiated to buy the <LOCATION> Atoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ranch from rancher <PERSON> E.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, at a price of $ 900,000, plus $ 99,000 for the cattle and hay, according to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit. The $ 500,000 down payment originated as cashier's checks in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> on Oct. 22, 1985, six days before <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' escape. Ten days after his escape, a checking account was opened at the <ORGANIZATION> Atoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>. From November 1985 through September 1987, more than $ 1.4 million was deposited in the <LOCATION> Atoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> account, according to a federal affidavit. Neither the bank nor its officers has been accused of wrongdoing. More money went into a bank in <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' alleged operation began to come unraveled in August, when two Texans rode their three-wheelers onto the Bar-20 Ranch. They said they were shot at, abducted and held in chains before they escaped. Police raided the ranch and discovered more than 6,700 marijuana plants. Ranch owner <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and two co-defendants were convicted of running one of the state's largest marijuana farms. At the trial, testimony brought up small details linking the two ranches and the people associated with them. Among other things, authorities allege <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> provided the introductions for the Mexicans to buy the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranch </PERSON>. `` We've been aware that they were there for a long time,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilfiger </PERSON> said of the Junior Ranch. He said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s arrest `` let the cat out of the bag. The day after <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' arrest, federal authorities raided the Junior Ranch and another property near <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and seized documents they are still studying. They also filed notice of intention to seize the ranch and other property as the proceeds of illegal drug transactions. No criminal charges have been filed related to the operation of the Junior Ranch, but a federal grand jury convenes May 31 in <LOCATION> Muskogee </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Horse Racing Ballot Question Appears To Carry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with final Lubbock returns and additional Dallas

throughout. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ballot proposal to authorize horse racing and pari-mutuel betting was approved Saturday in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and, by a narrow margin, in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where church leaders opposed it. They were the only two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> counties voting on the issue Saturday. Other counties voted in November, when residents statewide approved a proposal to let counties determine whether to allow wagering on horses. With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was 40,793, or 56 percent, for pari-mutuel betting and 31,626, or 44 percent, against. The final tally in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was 18,939, or 52 percent, for pari-mutuel betting, and 17,541, or 48 percent, against. Throughout the state, voters were also electing mayors, city councilmen and school trustees. The voting stirred limited interest in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where elections administrator <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherbet </PERSON> said he expected only about 10 percent of the registered voters to turn out. But <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> City Secretary <PERSON> Ranette </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said her telephone was kept busy with calls from people wanting to know where they could vote. She predicted a <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> turnout almost twice that of the last general election. Pari-mutuel betting was the most volatile issue on the ballot in the county since a narrow vote almost 20 years ago to legalize mixed-drink sales. Proponents of horse race betting tout it as a multimillion-dollar economic boon; opponents say it will lead to crime and compulsive gambling. Citizens Against Pari-Mutuel Gambling campaigned against the proposition largely through a mailing to 100 local churches, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaeser </PERSON>, minister of <ORGANIZATION> Broadway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> mayoral race, incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooksey </PERSON> came in second to former City Councilman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, but six other candidates split enough votes to force a runoff.

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is accused in a probate dispute of exploiting a woman who gave him $ 80,000 a year in trusts and willed $ 5 million to a psychiatric institute she founded during a decade of psychoanalysis with him. The legal battle is between Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s leading psychoanalysts, and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, only child of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>, who died in 1984 at age 78 <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> denies any wrongdoing. Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> left most of her estimated $ 5 million estate to a non-profit institute she established four years earlier to promote psychiatric research and music. None of the money has been paid, however, because her son is contesting her will in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A trial is scheduled to begin July 5. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> of improperly using his influence while treating his mother for depression to urge her to create the institute and `` wrongfully inducing'' her to bequeath her fortune to it, according to court documents. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, who was attending the annual meeting of the association in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, referred calls for comment to his attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> said he had advised <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> not to discuss the case. But <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> denied the allegations in an affidavit Dec. 4, 1986. `` I never made false representations to her for the purpose and with the intent of improperly controlling, dominating and misleading her and unduly influencing and wrongfully inducing her to execute her last will,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> said he saw `` no support or substantiation'' for claims that Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> was incompetent or unduly influenced. `` But anyone can file a lawsuit, and these days it has become a recognized means of social expression,'' he added. Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist who reviewed <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s conduct in Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s case at the request of her son's attorneys, contended in a deposition that there were grounds for a malpractice suit. He was paid $ 200 an hour as an expert witness. <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON> said he reviewed Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s prescription records and found she was taking enough medication to become psychologically and physically addicted. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, who will step down as president when the association's annual meeting ends Thursday, also is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychoanalysis </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> conducted up to five sessions a week with Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> from 1969 to 1980, when he transferred her case to two other psychiatrists, saying he needed more time for other professional duties, court documents show. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> continued prescribing medication for her until 1983, and records show he told the succeeding psychiatrists in a letter: `` Incidentally, I do hope that you are charging her a full fee for your housecalls and visits. She can well afford it.'' During the years Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> was a patient of <LOCATION> Pollock </LOCATION>: _ She established a trust fund that has paid <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> $ 50,000 a year since 1976 and will continue paying him through 1993 She established a second trust that has paid <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>'s family $ 30,000 a year since 1978. Court records are n't clear when the second trust expires. _ From 1969 until her death, Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> donated $ 601,330 to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychoanalysis </ORGANIZATION> Of that money, $ 60,233 went to a depression research fund controlled by <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. _ In 1980, she created the <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> worked for a short time as a paid consultant to the institute, but said in his affidavit that `` there is no secret agreement'' for him to participate in its future operations. He also denied receiving any benefit from Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s will. _ Mrs <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> dismissed her longtime attorneys when they expressed reservations about her institute and hired <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schanfield </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. _ In 1982, she amended her will to leave $ 200,000 to her son, several thousand dollars to two grandchildren and the rest of her money _ estimated at $ 5 million _ to the <ORGANIZATION> Lederer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> She also named <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schanfield </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as co-executors of her estate. <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s son was worth about $ 2 million before her death and that when she died he inherited about $ 6 million from a trust established by her father, E.J. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, vice president and comptroller of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s. The two <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> families are not related. Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> referred to her son's wealth to explain in her last will why she was leaving most of her money `` to my foundation.'' <PERSON> Schanfield </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> told him that he was one of four lawyers referred to her by <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> to review her estate planning and help her establish the research institute. `` Dr. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> played no role whatsoever in establishing that institute,'' <PERSON> Schanfield </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> set it up.'' In their briefs, attorneys for Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murnighan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, suggest she was dependent on <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. The attorneys contended that after Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>'s husband, a doctor, died in 1973, `` Dr. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> took the place of her husband and he constantly advised her on all facets of life, from where she was going to live, to what she was going to eat, to what medical treatment to get, to what raises to give the housekeeper.'' <PERSON> Tepper </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> were friends, and that the psychiatrist accepted her financial gifts `` because there was no reason not to accept'' them, a point of ethical debate. But <PERSON> Strasburger </PERSON> wrote: `` His acceptance of large gifts to his family, his institution and himself occurred in a pattern of conduct evidencing gross disregard for psychoanalytic principle and psychiatric propriety.'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstock </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew of no specific guidelines on ethics that prohibit psychiatrists from accepting gifts or donations from patients. `` I can say that it would be unusual while somebody is in treatment to accept large gifts,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It's not standard to do that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s principles of medical ethics do not contain a specific provision against accepting money or other gifts from patients beyond professional fees. But the principles do say a psychiatrist `` should not use the unique position of power afforded him by the psychotherapeutic situation to influence the patient in any way not directly relevant to the treatment goals.''

<HEAD>Field Crowded In Many Categories As Tony Award Nominations To Be
Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Tony Awards nominating committee has a happy problem this year, more talent and worthy performances in some categories than can be squeezed into the customary four nominations. Contrary to what has happened in some recent seasons, this year there should be some interesting contests in Broadway's equivalent of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s Oscars. The nominations are due to be announced Monday. The winners of the 42nd annual awards, to be chosen by a vote by more than 600 theater professionals, will be announced June 5 in a program broadcast nationally on CBS. Three plays eligible for `` best play'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> contention are by playwrights who have previously won the Pulitzer Prize, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, August <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The last play to open before the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> deadline was <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s `` Speed the Plow,'' which got lavish media attention because it stars rock star-actress <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s `` Glengarry <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>'' won a Pulitzer in 1984. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone,'' set early this century, is August <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s latest in his series of plays about the black experience in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, each set in a different decade. His `` Fences,'' set in the 1950s, which won him a Pulitzer Prize last year, is still running. <PERSON> Lanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for `` Talley's Folly,'' one of his cycle of plays about the <PERSON> Talley </PERSON> family on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, has a contender this season that is n't in that series, `` Burn This. Three possible `` best play'' nominees are based on real happenings. `` M. Butterfly'' is about a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat who had an affair with a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> thinking the man is a woman. `` A Walk in the Woods'' shows an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> arms negotiator talking informally outside their conference room in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. And `` Breaking the Code,'' which opened early in the season and is no longer running, is about <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turing </PERSON>, who broke the German's code in World War II. In musicals, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s `` The Phantom of the Opera'' is by far the season's hottest ticket and is almost assured a Tony nomination. It's not necessarily assured the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, since the Broadway community's <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> voters are proud of putting their artistic opinions ahead of box-office sales. Anything <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> composes also is almost assured a Tony nomination. He won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1985 for `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' His `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' fairy tales with `` realistic'' endings, opened this season. There's also `` Chess,'' another American-Russian confrontation, with music by the two writers for the rock group <ORGANIZATION> ABBA </ORGANIZATION> and lyrics by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s old partner, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>; `` Sarafina!'', a South African musical set in a terrorized schoolyard; and `` The Gospel at Colonus,'' the Oedipus story told in gospel music. Three which did n't run long are `` Roza,'' `` Mail'' and `` Teddy and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>.'' The nominating committee's trouble with the best-actor category this year should be narrowing nominees down to four. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON> was virtually a one-man show in `` Breaking the Code.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON>, no longer in the cast, was a bravura wild man in `` Burn This.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> plays the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> negotiator, the meatier of the two parts, in `` A Walk in the Woods.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON> is the French diplomat in `` M. Butterfly.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON> has the title role in `` Macbeth.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantegna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> costar in `` Speed the Plow.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> had the showy title role in `` Sherlock's Last Case,'' which opened last August and ran into December. As usual, starring parts for women are fewer. <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON>, who now has left the cast, was <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> in `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> played opposite <PERSON> Malkovich </PERSON> in `` Burn This.'' <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON> act opposite men in their plays. <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Macbeth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is the third character in `` Speed the Plow.'' For performers in musicals, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brightman </PERSON> sing the phantom and his obsession in `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillin </PERSON> sing <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> in the revival of `` Anything Goes.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> stars again in the revived `` Cabaret.'' <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariou </PERSON> sang <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in the departed `` Teddy and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> opened but no longer plays in `` Into the Woods.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> forms the triangle on the chessboard of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Casnoff </PERSON> in `` Chess.'' Longer shots for nominations are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON>, starring in `` Mail,'' which he composed, and <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> singing <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Becaud </PERSON> songs in `` Roza,'' which was based on the movie `` Madame Rosa,'' starring <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Signoret </PERSON>. The Tonies are named for actress <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, who was active in the American Theater Wing during the 1940s.

<HEAD>Overcrowding Stirs New Debate Over Airport Priorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> effort to relieve runway congestion by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a national debate over the role of major airports. What was a local dispute involving <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> has spilled over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is just the first foot over the line,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has introduced legislation designed to block <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> from implementing the plan. `` There are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to follow suit.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said that `` deteriorating air traffic gridlock'' justifies <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s goal of encouraging small aircraft to use other airfields in the area, saying, `` It's a balancing of equities. <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> faces a problem common to many airports: Air traffic and delays are growing, but expansion is unrealistic because of neighborhood opposition, a lack of available land and enormous construction costs. So the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION>, the state agency that operates <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, has announced a plan it says will permit more efficient use of the airport by 23 million passengers annually. As of July 1, landing fees for private planes and commuter airlines will be increased from the current minimum of $ 25 to an average of close to $ 100. The costs for large airliners _ now hundreds of dollars _ will drop by varying amounts. `` <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that the test of efficiency at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> is not the number of airplanes landed per hour, but the number of people handled per hour with a minimum of delay,'' the agency's executive director, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said when the plan was approved March 16 `` In other words, a 747 with 400 people on board deserves a higher priority than a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> with two people on board.'' The commuter airline, corporate aircraft and private plane industries say the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> plan is unfair because they have as much right to use the government-supported airport as airlines do. And the higher fees will hurt their businesses, they say. `` We price our service at what we think the market will stand,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredericksen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's commuter carriers. `` If we thought that extra money was out there, we'd charge it. Officials of the small plane industry fear that <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s plan may be only the beginning of restrictions across the country. Although air traffic grows every year, the last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan airport _ <ORGANIZATION> Dallas-Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> _ was completed in 1974. No new airports are under construction, although two cities _ <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> _ are moving toward building new ones, and about a dozen others hope to add runways at existing airfields. Since new airports take at least four years to build _ and cost $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion _ existing fields are moving to make better use of what they have. Modern air traffic equipment will allow more frequent takeoffs and landings, but it is expensive and in many cases needs further development. As delays grow, more airfields are considering shunting some of their small plane traffic elsewhere by raising fees, particularly during busy morning and evening hours. The <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which operates <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> airports, is expected in September to impose slight rush hour increases in takeoff fees for small planes. <ORGANIZATION> Massport </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON> declined to name airports that have contacted his agency but conceded, `` There are a lot of people watching us with great interest.'' Said <PERSON> Fredericksen </PERSON> of the regional airline group, `` Our concern is that airports will try to limit traffic, rather than expand capacity.'' <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON>'s bill, and an identical <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version co-sponsored by seven Northeastern lawmakers, face uncertain futures. The 1988 congressional schedule is a short one, and committee chairmen say they have not decided whether to even hold hearings for the legislation. But Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, D-Mich., a private plane pilot, said he will try attaching an amendment to a spending bill this month that would kill the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> plan and discourage other airports from adopting similar restrictions `` This is a national airspace system, and here we have one airport trying to make policy,'' he said. Opponents of the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> program have opened other fronts. Small plane industry groups have filed federal lawsuits in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and also have asked the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to step in on their behalf. Supporters of <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>'s efforts say, however, that similar plans are inevitable. `` It's the wave of the future,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` As the skies get more crowded, rational pricing policies will be imposed at other airports, and <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> is blazing the trail.''

<HEAD>Questions Remain On Missile Pact As Senate Nears Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to open debate on the new U.S.-Soviet missile treaty this week, provided the White House and the Kremlin can resolve last-minute questions over verification provisions and the use of futuristic technology. `` We're still conferring with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and hope to come to a resolution by Tuesday evening,'' an administration official said. `` We have discussed this with the Soviets and ... we feel confident it can be resolved,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified. While only a handful of senators are on record as opposed to the treaty, it is an open question whether there is time to ratify it before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> open their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting on May 29. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, resisting appeals from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has said he will not be driven by the approaching summit or by any other outside factor. Last month, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> set Wednesday as a tentative date for the opening of debate on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty if the outstanding issues can be resolved. On Monday and Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will consider legislation authorizing $ 299.5 billion in spending for the Pentagon. The bill also calls for increased spending on non-nuclear weapons in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to help reduce Soviet superiority in such arms. Three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees _ Intelligence, <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Foreign Relations _ will spend Monday and Tuesday looking for ways to resolve the four outstanding issues: _ Futuristic weapons: <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> wants a legally binding, written commitment from the Kremlin setting out the extent to which the new treaty covers medium-range weapons using laser rays, particle beam generators or other technology still on the drawing boards _ Futuristic weapons verification: <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> wants a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report on the ability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies to verify a ban on futuristic weapons _ Verification: <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> wants the Soviets to make clear they will live up to treaty terms that require intrusive on-site inspection to detect cheating Some Soviet officials have been quoted as saying certain practices would not be allowed on Soviet soil. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters recently he wants to make sure the Soviets are not backing away from treaty requirements. _ Intelligence: <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> wants a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration commitment that it will significantly increase long-range spending for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence efforts to monitor Soviet compliance with treaties, including obtaining more effective spy satellites <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the INF treaty in a White House ceremony last Dec. 8. Since then, the pact has been subjected to intense scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has primary jurisdiction over treaties, as well as by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> panels, each focusing on their areas of expertise. If it goes into effect, the pact would require the elimination of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet ground-launched missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles. A leading sticking point in the controversy over whether or not futuristic weapons are included in the medium-range weapon ban is the fact the treaty contains no definition of exactly what constitutes a `` weapon delivery vehicle.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators testified that they and their Soviet counterparts made no attempt to define terms that had a generally understood meaning and that the word `` weapon'' fell into that list. <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, testified that while the subject of futuristic weapons was never specifically raised in the negotiations, the term `` weapon delivery vehicle'' covers any medium-range missile _ however armed _ if it is able to destroy a target. An initial Soviet attempt last month to resolve the issue went awry in confusion over differences in two translations of a letter from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. During the defense bill debate, amendments are likely to both increase spending for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and also call for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in the 16-nation alliance to pay more of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s costs. Also expected are proposals providing advice to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the arms control policies he should follow in the last six months of his administration. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to give final approval Wednesday to its Pentagon bill. Similar action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will send the separate measures to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to reconcile the differences.

<HEAD>Chinese Paper Crunch Creates Textbook Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Chinese schoolchildren will go without textbooks this fall because of a worsening paper shortage, an official newspaper reported Sunday. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said the crunch resulted from the rising cost of making paper, hoarding by speculators who resell it for profit, and a state-ordered cut in imports. It also said many manufacturers are reluctant to make the kind of paper used in newspapers, magazines and textbooks because the government keeps the factory sale price unprofitably low. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cabinet, has ordered local governments that publish and distribute textbooks to increase subsidies to encourage publication. It also gave publishers permission to raise prices, the report said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> uses about 13 million tons of paper each year, the newspaper said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> conducted an underground nuclear test Sunday on an Arctic island to upgrade its military technology, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The blast at <ORGANIZATION> Novaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zemlya </ORGANIZATION> island north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> measured from 20 to 150 kilotons, the official news agency said.

He said the prime minister had pledged to help the operation. In the past, there have been tensions between relief organizations and the government, which bans contacts with rebels. They took up arms against the government of this <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nation in 1983, demanding more autonomy and economic reforms. Since then, fierce fighting has forced hundreds of thousands of southerners to flee to towns and cities, where they depend on relief food. Government officials who banned the four relief groups said they were no longer needed. But other sources said the government acted mainly because the groups had contacted rebels to arrange for transport of food supplies to civilians caught in the cross fire. The rebels, who control more than 90 percent of the southern countryside, have been attacking relief convoys. They claim the government uses them to transport military troops and supplies.

 A Turk who was acquitted of conspiracy in the shooting of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has been detained in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it was reported Sunday. The <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Sabahattin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakmakoglu </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, as saying <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities notified them Friday of the detention of Oral Celik. <PERSON> Cakmakoglu </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION> he did not have any other details. Other Turkish dailies quoted unidentified Interior Minister officials as saying they too were notified Friday night about <PERSON> Celik </PERSON>'s detention. Celik is wanted in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on charges of complicity in the 1979 murder of <PERSON> Abdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ipekci </PERSON>, a liberal newspaper editor in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, and of murder in the killing of a teacher, <PERSON> Nevzat </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, three months later in <LOCATION> Malatya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cakmakoglu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had reiterated to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> its request for Celik's extradition.

Under Italian law, acquittal for lack of evidence does not amount to a complete finding of innocence.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Moslem guerrillas on Sunday claimed they killed 300 Afghan army troops and captured 120 as they overran another communist government post in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. A statement by the seven-member alliance of guerrilla parties said it got news of the victory in a radio report late Saturday. At the same time, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was reporting it had inflicted `` heavy losses'' on guerrillas at the same place, capturing scores of rockets, mortars, machine guns, mines and ammunition. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, did say when that fighting took place. Both reports placed the battle at <LOCATION> Chamkani </LOCATION>, nine miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province. The guerrillas said they attacked retreating Afghan forces and destroyed 12 tanks and 18 armored personnel carriers. `` The fleeing enemy forces could not take away their dead bodies,'' the statement said. `` On the mujahedeen side, 30 were martyred and 80 others were injured.'' It said that on Sunday, Soviet and Afghan forces were still bombing and shelling the areas of <LOCATION> Chamkani </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jaji </PERSON>. It said guerrillas were sniping at the retreating forces on the highway leading west to <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province. If the guerrilla report was accurate, it would add to the list of at least six Soviet-Afghan positions overrun in two weeks. Soviet forces reportedly have been pulling back from bases in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in preparation for their total withdrawal, scheduled to begin May 15. Soviet forces intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> government in its war with the guerrillas. Afghan security forces, well-equipped but reportedly sagging in morale, have had little success in facing the U.S.-armed guerrillas alone. The insurgents, based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, claim hundreds of Afghan army fighters have deserted to the guerrillas since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> announced its intention early this year to end its military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago, the guerrillas announced a major offensive aimed at pushing toward <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. On April 22, the guerrillas captured a major Soviet-Afghan garrison at <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION>, just a few steps from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> frontier. It opened a key new supply route for insurgents operating east, north and west of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says some of her male colleagues resent a woman running the country. `` Yes, it is rather patronizing. The best compliment they can give a woman is that she thinks like a man. I say she does not, she thinks like a woman,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in an interview with The Sunday Times. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 62, last week marked nine years in power, the longest of any prime minister this century. She is one of only 41 women in the 630-member House of Commons. She agreed with interviewer <PERSON> Brtian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> that some of the men there are puzzled because she does n't fit their image of women as dithery and weak. `` The House is still very much male-dominated and there is something about them, a sort of ` little woman' thing. It would be all right if I had gone into what they would regard as one of the traditional professions _ all right if I had followed <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nightingale </LOCATION>; all right, you know, if I had gone into teaching,'' she said. <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nightingale </LOCATION> is regarded as the founder of modern nursing for her life-saving work among soldiers during <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Crimean war with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1854 Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has won all three general elections it contested under her leadership and she said she hopes to lead it into the next election in 1991, and maybe the one after that. She said she wo n't step down until she believes her party has enough younger people committed to her policies. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> rejected suggestions she is authoritarian and ruthless in her effort to `` turn <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> round'' and restore the `` British sense of enterprise and initiative.'' `` The view I take is that a prime minister has a task of leadership. If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? All right, so I give a certain sound,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> greatly admired her father, a grocer and alderman in a small town, but she said there were people who disliked her success because they despised her origins. `` Some of them are snobs,'' she said. `` They can never forgive me for coming from a very ordinary background. It does not bother me at all. I can not stand snobbery of any kind.''

 The murder, rape and robbery rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was several times higher than in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the early 1980s at a time when overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crimes rates were declining, a newly issued government study said Sunday. In 1984, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 7.9 homicides, 35.7 rapes and 205.4 robberies per 100,000 people, concluded the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The European nations the same year had an average of 1.5 homicides, 5.4 rapes and 49.1 robberies per 100,000 people. 1984 is the latest year for which comparative figures were available. Rates for other crimes also were higher in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, the difference in property crime rates was not as great. In 1984, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> burglary rate was 20 percent higher than in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates for auto theft and larceny were about double the average in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. From 1980 to 1984, the rate for crimes reported to police in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell for each offense studied, except for rape. The declines ranged from 12 percent for auto theft to 24 percent for burglary. Meanwhile, the average crime rates for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> collectively increased for all crimes except murder in the early 1980s. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates for violent crime in 1984 also were higher than those in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, but the differences were smaller than those with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And data from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> shows a burglary rate for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> that is about 40 percent higher than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate. The study examined homicide, rape, robbery, larceny, burglary and auto theft because those are the crimes most likely to be understood and defined in the same general way from country to country.

<HEAD>Danes Asked To Choose: No-Nuke Policy or NATO Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> on Tuesday will be faced with the tricky choice between their <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and their longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons in one of the country's most important elections since World War II. The sudden storm over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s role in the 16-nation alliance came as a surprise to many voters, usually more worried about unemployment and national debt than military issues. A ban on nuclear weapons in peacetime has already been in effect for three decades. The showdown began April 14 when the opposition, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, pushed through a parliamentary resolution requiring the government to notify visiting warships of the nuclear arms ban. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> never confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on their ships. The allies reacted sharply, saying the move jeopardized <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s participation in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. A meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s Nuclear Planning Group was rescheduled from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> called off several <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> port visits. Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> supporter, called a general election, asking voters to `` take a stand'' on the issue. `` Has the <PERSON> Danes </PERSON>' national pride deteriorated so much that we will bow to pressure from abroad?'' the left-leaning newspaper Information asked in a front-page editorial. `` The question is the central one in the current debate, and in that sense, the election is the most important since the Second World War.'' It did n't help matters when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> joked to reporters that `` Danish means breakfast to me.'' National radio played the English-language tape on the air, an unusual step, and the liberal Politiken newspaper printed the sarcastic headline, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> staff demonstrates its knowledge of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> later apologized. The confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this country of 5.1 million. The last general election in September left <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s four-party coalition holding just 70 of the Folketing's 179 votes, but with enough support to command a majority on economic matters Tuesday's vote is not a direct referendum on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, but a vote for representatives in the Folketing. What happens afterward depends on how many votes are split among the Social Democrats, the biggest single party, <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s center-right coalition and a handful of smaller parties. Polls indicate that while most Danes agree with the traditional anti-nuclear position, many have contradictory feelings about <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. One survey said 82 percent of those asked favored a nuclear-free zone in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, and 46 percent said they would support the idea even if it meant <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s expulsion from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. But a recent poll by the Observa organization showed that 66 percent of <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> favor staying in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and just 16 percent oppose membership, the most lopsided margin in years. Another published survey showed that 46 percent of <LOCATION> Danes </LOCATION> believed it was reasonable to ask <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ships to guarantee they carry no nuclear arms, 36 percent did not and 18 percent were undecided. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s low-lying peninsula and islands command the approaches to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategists envision it as a key supply point in case of a Soviet invasion. The NATO-Danish clash follows years of contention over <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s declining defense spending, which now amounts to 2.1 percent of its gross national product, among the lowest in the alliance But in random interviews with window shoppers along <PERSON> Stroeget </PERSON>, a pedestrian street in the heart of <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, voters seemed more worried about domestic matters than global politics. `` It's not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the way the government runs society,'' said <PERSON> Susane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, a conservative voter who works in a health insurance office. `` We have to face these economic problems.'' Unemployment is running at 9.7 percent. With a national debt worth more than $ 43 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has warned that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s currency could run into trouble unless costs are kept under control. <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thy </PERSON>, editor and writer for a computer magazine, said he planned to vote against the government because `` I do n't think they have achieved much.'' The nuclear question? `` That's a joke. That's not the issue. Something went wrong in the corridors,'' he said. The no-nuclear notification letter _ the cause of the fuss _ has yet to be written. It's likely the note would simply restate national policy without requiring a response from the ships' commanders Defense setbacks are nothing new for the Danish government. The April 14 resolution was its 23rd loss in parliament since 1982 on a defense question. It passed by 75 to 58, with 46 lawmakers absent. But the timing of the resolution, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> discuss further cutbacks in nuclear weapons, probably touched a nerve on the American side, speculated <PERSON> Nikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Aarhus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> reacts vigorously, it could therefore be linked to the fact that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> has contested an important American negotiating position,'' he wrote in Det Fri Aktuelt newspaper.

<HEAD>Market Reform May Get Caught in Congress-Administration Clash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of federal regulators working on ways to prevent another stock market crash appears certain to clash with activist members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who want to do more than the anti-regulation <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The group, appointed in mid-March, is chaired by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Under Secretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> and includes the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. According to two sources familiar with its deliberations, the focus of group's recommendations is likely to be improved communication and cooperation among both exchanges and regulatory agencies rather than jurisdictional changes requiring new legislation. If that is the case, it will not satisfy either Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, or Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the finance subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> However, one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the Gould group's positions were still fluid and could change before it reports to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the week of May 16. And, pressure on the group to recommend more than it apparently had intended increased on two fronts last week. An earlier <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, headed by Wall Street investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, issued a statement warning that regulatory turf fights should not be permitted to sidetrack market reform, which it said `` will inevitably require legislation.'' And, according to one of the sources, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has made it clear he will stake out an independent position if the <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> group's final report does not go far enough. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has urged that his own agency, which regulates the stock markets, be given additional authority over stock index futures, which currently fall under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. At the very least, he wants `` tie-breaking'' authority to resolve disputes during emergencies, such as the record Oct. 19 decline of 508 points in the Dow Jones average. Both <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> are opposing jurisdictional changes. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> has introduced a bill that would create a three-member committee to coordinate regulation. It would consist of the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman would head the committee, but disputes would be resolved by majority vote. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s staff is still working on legislation and is unlikely to be finished before the <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> group reports to the president, according to an aide, who asked not to be identified by name. However, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, should regulate stock index futures. The administration working group appears likely to recommend only one of the changes sought by legislators and the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel: brief, coordinated `` circuit breakers'' to break the momentum of a soaring or plunging market, one of the sources said. Agreement on margin levels _ the amount of money required to make an investment in either the stock or futures markets _ was `` still within the realm of possibility'' but less likely because of strong disagreement between <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, the source said. Futures margins are higher than they were before the Oct. 19 stock market crash, but <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has said further increases are needed. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, reflecting the views of the industry her agency regulates, has resisted. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> sets stock and stock option margins, while the individual futures exchanges set their own margins. According to the source, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials also believe ideally that stock and option exchanges ought to set their own margins. However, the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel in its statement last week said margin-setting was too important to leave to the exchanges. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is the logical agency to set all equity margins to ensure their harmony with one another. According to <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s aide, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressman sides with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel on that issue and is considering including in any legislation a direction that stocks and futures margins be not just harmonious, but equivalent. That would be controversial. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and executives of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges argue that stock and futures margins serve different purposes and need not be the same. Other tentative provisions of <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s bill would give the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> power to impose trading halts and take other action during market emergencies. The legislation also is likely to prohibit cross-market front-running. Some brokerage firms have been accused of profiting in either the stock or futures market by trading for their own accounts in front of a major trade by a big client like a mutual or pension fund in the other market. The Gould group from the start faced criticism from <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> that it was little more than a delaying tactic by the administration, anxious to avoid any additional regulation of the markets. They believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must get moving this spring before its members become preoccupied with the summer political conventions and their own re-election campaigns in the fall. However, the participation of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on the side of <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> has made the debate more complicated than a dispute between Democrats and Republicans. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, is a close adviser to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and is considered a leading candidate for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary should <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> win the presidential election in November. Republican staffers are assisting <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> aides in drafting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation, although it is unclear what parts Republicans will ultimately support, according to the <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> aide. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s backing helped <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> obtain more Republican co-sponsors than Democratic. Five Republicans and three Democrats have signed on.

<HEAD>Singapore Defends Ouster Of U.S. Diplomat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Sunday defended its ouster of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat and offered to back up charges that he meddled in local politics. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed with `` deep regret'' to a request from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> Saturday to withdraw <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, a political attache. The government also asked that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> be reprimanded along with two unidentified senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who it said sanctioned his activities. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> denied allegations, made by the Home Affairs Ministry, that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> interfered in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s politics. In meeting members of the political opposition, `` which appears to be the basis of the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government's protest, Mr. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> was doing what American diplomats are expected to do in any country, namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum of individuals in order to report accurately developments in the country in question,'' <PERSON> Gong </PERSON> said. In a statement Sunday, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> said it would not `` capriciously or arbitrarily expel diplomats from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, especially when the diplomat in question represents a friendly nation.'' `` The assertion that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> has not in any way acted improperly can only be a diplomatic fig leaf which the government is content to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to wear,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> contends that <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> met with opposition activists and urged them to contest upcoming elections. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is heavily favored to retain control of this island republic of 2.6 million people in elections that must be held by December 1989. The party holds all but one of the 79 seats in parliament and there is no viable opposition capable of dislodging it. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> `` was trying to manipulate and instigate Singaporeans, in order to bring about a particular political outcome,'' the government said. His explusion was an unprecedented jolt to normally warm relations between the two countries. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> long ago established close personal and political ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and recently returned from `` private'' talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest buyer of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s exports and one of the biggest investors in this former British colony that gained full independence in 1965. The diplomatic tiff is the latest in a chain of events that began with the arrests last year of 22 Singaporeans accused of belonging to a `` clandestine communist network.'' They were seized under the Internal Security Act which allows for indefinate detention without trial. All but one were freed by Dec. 26, most of them with restrictions on their movements. Among them was a lawyer, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Seong </PERSON>, who allegedly was urged by <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> to fight the government. <PERSON> Seong </PERSON> was arrested again on April 19 along with eight of the 22 former detainees. That was less than 24 hours after the eight proclaimed their innocence and said they had been abused and coerced into making incriminating statements late last year. On April 28, the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the eight had sworn fresh declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming their original guilt. They are still behind bars and officials said an investigation continues. Besides <PERSON> Seong </PERSON>, 34, <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> was linked by the government to lawyer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Seow </PERSON>, 59. <PERSON> Seow </PERSON> was arrested Friday, hours after he appeared in court seeking the release of two of those arrested April 19. <PERSON> Seow </PERSON>, a former solictor-general and one time president of the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is being held without charge under the Internal Security Act `` for purposes of investigation into foreign interferences in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s internal affairs.'' Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsien </PERSON> <PERSON> Loong </PERSON> said two distinct phases of the so-called political movement had become clear. One was a Marxist conspiracy involving the original 22, the other was separate action by foreign elements who made use of the detainees to meddle in domestic politics, he said.

 Authorities are extending mandatory birth control to the far northwest's ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed more children than majority <PERSON> Hans </PERSON>, an official report said Sunday. As of July 1, minority couples in cities of <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> Uygur Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in rural areas will be permitted three, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Minority ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 56 ethnic minority groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of supporters of former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> marched through the capital Sunday and demanded that the ousted leader be allowed to return from exile to attend his mother's funeral. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, in a radio broadcast hours after the march, reiterated that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could not return because his presence might cause trouble and destabilize the government. `` I know that some people were upset that he was not allowed to return,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in her weekly radio program, `` Ask the President.'' `` But I think the great majority are concerned that, first of all, we preserve whatever gains we have attained during the past two years,'' she said. `` And it is very necessary to preserve the stability that we have attained for the good of the entire country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> indicated she might allow a visit by any of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' three children, but she said the family must make a formal request to give the government time to prepare for security The president said no requests had been made. Officials have said the ban on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, applied to all members of his immediate family. Immigration officials said they would be arrested if they entered the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. There have been news reports that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, planned to sneak into the country to represent his father at the funeral, which has n't been scheduled. The former president's other relatives denied the reports. About 4,000 marchers blew whistles, shot off firecrackers and chanted, `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>! <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>!'' along a six-mile route from a downtown park to a suburban Roman Catholic church where the body of <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> lay in state. Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON> died in a hospital Wednesday at the age of 95. Just before she died, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother sent Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> a deathbed wish that her son be allowed to return so she could see him one last time. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> with his wife and three children during the February 1986 `` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>'' that ended his 20-year rule and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. He said in a statement Wednesday that he will `` exhaust all possibilities'' to attend the funeral. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' younger brother, <PERSON> Pacifico </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos-Barba </PERSON>, said they have not set a burial date because they hope Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will change her mind. At the head of the march was an empty, makeshift coffin draped with a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flag and a sign saying, `` <PERSON> Ninoy </PERSON> has died, <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> has risen, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> will come again.'' <PERSON> Ninoy </PERSON> was the nickname of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, former Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983 as he stepped off a plane after returning to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from three years' voluntary exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The assassination triggered waves of protest that contributed to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' downfall.

 An unusual late-night tornado slammed into a mobile home without warning, killing a woman and her baby and critically injuring her husband while thunderstorms caused scattered damage in eastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Two-inch hailstones broke windows in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and wind up to 60 mph pushed over trees and damaged other mobile homes. The tornado touched down with no warning, ripping the roof off a farmhouse and causing extensive damage to another house as well as the mobile home shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday, said <LOCATION> Sarpy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Polikov </PERSON>. `` The weather service is not feeling too good about not being able to get a warning out before,'' <PERSON> Polikov </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It is unusual to have them that late at night in this area. They usually are in the evening. It could n't be seen by radar.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, a meteorologist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, said Sunday that the tornado touched down only for a few minutes. He confirmed the funnel was not detected by radar. `` It was the same thunderstorm that we followed with 1-inch hail in the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> area, but as far as showing a tornado, that was n't apparent through our radar detector,'' he said `` We started detecting it in western <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but that was after it had touched down. It apparently touched down and then went right back up.'' Small tornadoes that touch down only briefly are much more difficult to detect than large ones, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. Two-year-old <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON> was dead at the scene, <PERSON> Polikov </PERSON> said. Her mother, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON>, 29, died of head injuries early Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON>, 31, underwent surgery and was reported in critical but stable condition at <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Papillion </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, more than 10 miles to the northeast, minor injuries were reported, trees were knocked down and dozens of small power outages were reported, along with hail as large as 2 inches in diameter. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the hail broke windows at his office in north <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. `` We've got hailstones out here that are as big as hen's eggs. They are bigger than golf balls,'' he said. Six to eight mobile homes in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> were damaged, including one that flipped on its side, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Millard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wahoo </PERSON>, Fremont, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> were hit by wind as strong as 60 mph, the weather service said.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s son has been called to active military service and has been urged by his mother to accept the 30-day draft to trim his waistline, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers report. The papers, published Sunday, quoted <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as saying he received the notice last year but could not comply because of injuries sustained when mutinous troops attacked the presidential palace during the Aug. 28 coup attempt. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in the attempt, the most serious of half a dozen bids to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she came to power in February 1986. The 28-year-old <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who works in an insurance firm, said he received a second notice recently but was reluctant to accept because he feared the rigidity of military training, the papers said. So he sought advice from his mother, who urged him to undergo military training if only to trim his waistline. `` You have no wife and no children, yet your belly is so big it makes you look like a father,'' <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> quoted his mother as saying. He said he has been assigned to a <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> unit with the rank of master sergeant, but did not say when he will begin training.

<HEAD>Dingell: Weak Bolts Causing `Serious Problems' in Two Army Units</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army has `` serious problems'' in two of its front-line units because of continuing problems with weak bolts in some vehicles, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said Sunday The problem may be even more extensive than that because the two units received their bolts from the same depots that supply other <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units, both here and overseas, said <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> also heads the investigations subcommittee, which held widely publicized hearings last August revealing problems of bolts and fasteners that were n't as strong as expected. The result is that wheel assemblies on some <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> vehicles, such as trucks and the all-purpose `` Hum-V,'' may come lose, according to testimony that will be presented Monday to the investigations subcommittee during a follow-up hearing. A subcommittee staff report said the problem fasteners were still found in large numbers in vehicles of the 7th Infantry division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the 9th Regiment at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tansill </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the depots that supply the bolts, admitted the service is still having problems `` We're very concerned about this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` We have been remiss in not educating soldiers at the lowest level about using the right grade of bolts.'' But she noted that in a series of tests, `` we've found that many of the bolts are still effective, even though they are substandard compared to contract specifications.'' The subcommittee staff report noted that `` the vehicles of the units we visited contained a number of fasteners from foreign manufacturers whose bolts had previously been found substandard in numerous laboratory tests.'' `` The combat units were experiencing severe fastener problems on their vehicles to the extent that the combat readiness of some units was affected,'' it said. Because the fasteners were not as strong as they should have been, some of them came lose in front wheel assemblies of the Hum-V, the investigators found. `` This caused tire wear, fastener failure, and if not corrected, loss of steering.'' In a check of the 9th Regiment, half of the 102 Hum-Vs checked had loose fasteners and seven had been lost from service because the problem was so severe, the subcommittee investigators found. One officer got so frustrated with trying to get the right fasteners that he `` bought replacement bolts from the civilian economy with money from his own pocket in order to get the unit's vehicles ready By a stroke of luck, he obtained domestic bolts at the local hardware store,'' the report said. Part of the problem is that bolts are stored in a variety of bins and the containers are n't always clearly marked, according to Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The subcommittee investigators agreed, reporting that <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> maintenance personnel `` admitted that over 50 percent of their bins contained fasteners of unknown quality and complained that they were not receiving sufficient information to purge the suspect fasteners.''

 A familiar <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> line _ `` They take the early bus'' _ took on a new meaning for reporters traveling with the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> presidential campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> regularly makes the statement when referring to the working poor as a way to illustrate that many poor people are hardworking but still ca n't make a decent living. On Friday, the press bus broke down en route from a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> to another in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s limousine, motorcyle escort and the rest of the motorcade disappeared up the Harbor Freeway, while the bus limped to the shoulder, disabled by a transmission problem, it was established later. The staff called for another bus as the reporters fumed about being stranded. An argument ensued among the driver, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent and a camera crew that wanted to get out and film the stalled bus. The camera crew stayed inside. The new bus arrived after about 10 minutes and fought its way through freeway traffic to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, had arrived and saw another reporter who had been riding in a separate press van while her colleagues languished on the roadside. When he asked how she got there so soon, the reporter told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` I took the early bus.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been getting a lot of mileage out of belittling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lately. He has not had to look far for ammunition. A recent favorite: he quotes an April 30 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> story in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about reports that he has sought the resignation of embattled Attorney Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was quoted as replying, `` I deny I have ever given my opinion to anybody.'' The line gets a big laugh when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeats it, as he did in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> several thousand unionists attending a machinists convention last week. As far as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> being in the driver's seat, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came across another news story describing a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> photo opportunity for the press. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to drive a Jeep, as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tells it, to improve his image of toughness, `` so it would look like he was going to take <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> someplace.'' At this point in the story, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pauses for effect. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he says, `` got in on the rider's side.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> often talks about crossing lines of race, sex and religion to find common ground among disparate groups. But he had his work cut out for him in <LOCATION> Parma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a predominantly white, blue-collar suburb of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> where racist attitudes were voiced openly by some. An elderly woman said she could not support the black minister because `` I'd rather have our man in there, one of ours, you know what I mean.'' When the reporter asked what she meant, she replied, `` I'd rather have a white person.'' One elderly man told a reporter he did not think <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would get much support around here because `` People do n't want a black president. It will turn the country around.'' A union representative told another reporter that black people do n't want to work very hard. The comments were made in impromptu interviews with people attending a rowdy popcorn-and-beer fund raiser for for Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Okar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> last week. The sea of white faces <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> found when he entered the union hall was not unusual for him. Around the country, many whites attend his rallies and he has an active blue-collar following. But this was not his crowd. There was a constant din as he spoke and many, having heard Okar earlier, walked out or lined up at the beer counter in the back during <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech.

 For <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, picking a vice presidential nominee is a key step in putting together the pieces of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> puzzle, as strategists try to fit the person to the political geography. Should <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pick a Southern senator as his running mate to help the Democrats win in the region this fall? `` It just does n't work when we go with two Northerners on the ticket,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Should <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> name <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to the No. 2 spot on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket to grab the biggest state's votes on Nov. 8? `` The Democrats must beat us in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to have a chance,'' said Republican consultant <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>. The pieces of the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> puzzle are states, each offering a prize of electoral votes toward the goal of 270, the majority needed to win the White House. The choice of a running mate _ always a tough decision _ is complicated in 1988 because <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has helped redraw the political contours of the country: _ The once solidly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> is now viewed as one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two strongholds _ along with the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states of the West. _ With <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not on the ticket, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will be very competitive with a prize of 47 electoral votes. _ The farm states of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, long GOP bastions, are ripe for Democratic appeals after years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agriculture policies that have left the region feeling battered. _ The big industrial states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and the like are shaping up as very close battles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the odds-on favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination, must put his piece of the puzzle down first, when the Democratic National Convention meets in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can look over the full opposition ticket before making a decision at the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. Historically, vice presidential candidates are n't the most important factor in an election win, but they do count. `` I think it gets you the state where the running mate is from, but not much more,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamarck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> activist and political scientist, citing various studies. `` Nobody is going to carry a region as a vice presidential nominee,'' argues <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who managed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign. But that much wider impact is the keystone of the argument from those who are pushing a Southerner for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s running mate. Democrats making this argument say that the only times the party has won the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since 1952 was with a Southerner on board and a good showing in the region, which sports 182 electoral votes. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs a Southern senator as a running mate, not another governor,'' said <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> on Friday in saying he should not be the running mate. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is the prime candidate under this scenario, since he is a conservative Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But others mentioned as well are former presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Is <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> going to bring us the rest of the South?'' asked Democratic pollster <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>. `` He's not very well known outside of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Of course, he will make an appeal ... but he will be overshadowed by the top of the ticket.'' A non-Southerner who could have appeal in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, whose military background, ex-astronaut status and moderate views would have appeal in the region. And perhaps as importantly, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> is popular in his home state with its 23 electoral votes. While the South is important, almost everyone agrees that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is critical. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is the key,'' said Democratic consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russonello </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is not a Republican anchor. It's very much up for grabs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>. The state's 47 electoral votes are the biggest prize in the general election, almost one-fifth of the majority needed. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, the state's popular governor and a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backer, has always been high on the lists of possible <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominees. But there is a major drawback: if <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> won the vice presidency, he would have to turn the governor's chair over to a Democrat. `` It is impossible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrance </PERSON>, `` because of his sincere and intense interest in running the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> choice will also be shaped by the Democratic moves. A Southern choice by the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would `` open up the opportunity to do some cherry-picking in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' explains <PERSON> Wirthlin </PERSON>. Former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> are two names mentioned. In contrast, a Midwestern choice by the opposition might send the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rushing to <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. But then there is Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential hopeful with strong <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ties and a message of economic optimism that <ORGANIZATION> Tarrance </ORGANIZATION> said would be appealing in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is the most often mentioned southerner among the Republicans, if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided to shore up his base there. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> gets mentioned as a possible Western candidate. A completely different approach for the Republicans would be to choose a woman for the No. 2 spot, as the Democrats did with <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in 1984. While choosing former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> or former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> would have impact in their home states, the larger goal would be to narrow the `` gender gap'' of negative women's opinions that has hurt the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> since 1980.

<TEXT>
 After sparking three consecutive nights of violence, <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s annual spring festival faces an overhaul in order to curb excessive drinking, school officials and student organizers of the festival agree. `` We're looking to work with the university and city to see what changes we can make,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, a sophomore from <LOCATION> Geneseo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who is on the committee for the <LOCATION> Veishea </LOCATION> festival, an annual long weekend of student activities. Early Sunday, eight law officers were injured and 45 people were arrested as student celebrations coinciding with <PERSON> Veishea </PERSON> concluded. There were two arrests early Friday and nine early Saturday. `` This certainly mars what has been a very good weekend for Veishea. But we're going to have to reassess the whole Veishea activity ... and the amount of time students have off,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thielen </PERSON>, university vice president of student affairs. He was on the scene early Sunday as raucous students set fires in streets and pelted officers and police vehicles with rocks and bottles. Student organizers of the 66th annual Veishea festival disavowed the rioting, saying it was not connected with any formal activities that included a parade on Saturday that was followed by the football team's spring game. occurred. The event was named by taking the first letter in the name of each of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s original colleges `` We've been trying to promote the non-alcoholic aspect of <LOCATION> Veishea </LOCATION> this year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said later Sunday. `` We do n't know why things got out of hand.'' Helmeted police clashed with an estimated crowd of 2,000 early Sunday in the heart of campus, where bonfires were fed by sofas and other furniture carried by beer-drinking revelers. Nightly disturbances at the annual spring festival started Thursday and grew progressively worse before the festival ended Sunday. Like the previous two nights, the latest disturbance appeared to start with private parties. `` It was pretty ugly for a while,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballantine </PERSON>. `` Frankly, I have n't seen anything like this since the early 1970s and the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war protests. `` The only difference is those people had a legitimate gripe. These people did n't. They were just drunk.'' As state, county and city law enforcement officers helped firefighters move in to put out the fires Sunday, they were pelted with bottles and rocks thrown by crowd members. Two police cars were damaged when hit by concrete blocks. At least two people in the crowd were burned, but not seriously, said police dispatcher <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. When law officers had little success persuading the crowd to disperse, the school's popular basketball coach, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, came to campus after 3 a.m. and pleaded with students to go home. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> warned them their actions were damaging the school's reputation. The crowd broke up a short time later. Most of the 45 people arrested were charged with inciting to riot, an aggravated misdemeanor. Eight officers were treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, with two requiring stitches to close wounds. The violence erupted as dozens of officers from the Ames police department, the Story County sheriff's department, the state patrol and campus security lined both sides of <LOCATION> Welch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, a strip of taverns and small shops, escorting firefighters to the bonfires.

 The animosity between <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that has led to their recent diplomatic split is rooted in a centuries-old schism in the Moslem world between the Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> sects. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION>, dragged the religious feud into the 20th century, sparking new fears among the conservative, Sunni-dominated <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states and other Arab countries. The revolution's triumph in toppling the pro-Western <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> also fueled Islamic fervor among fundamentalist Sunnis. That, along with the vigorous <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> challenge, has ignited violence from socialist <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to monarchist <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in the last decade. The Islamic resurgence has brought a religious intensity not witnessed since the Middle Ages and has perplexed and alarmed the West. While the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> cited terrorism and threats for breaking relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on April 27, they mainly were seeking to head off Iranian-inspired violence in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in this year's annual haj, or pilgrimage. More than 400 pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians, were killed in rioting in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> last year that shocked the Moslem world. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> vowed revenge and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for the overthrow of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s royal family. The Saudis want to avoid a repetition of the violence this year by getting Moslem countries to scale down the number of pilgrims they send. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, asked to trim its contingent of the usual 150,000 by about one-third, refuses. Instead, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has revived calls for an Islamic crusade against <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and stripping the royal family of custodianship of Islam's holiest shrines in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s birthplace, and in <LOCATION> Medina </LOCATION>, where he is buried. The guardianship of these holy sites is one of the underpinnings of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> monarchy that gives it political legitimacy in the eyes of most Moslems. The deepening hostility between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been exacerbated by the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war, in which the Saudis have supported <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The Arabs and Persians, separated by language and culture, have been religious rivals since the death of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, in 632 A.D. The Sunnis, who make up more than 90 percent of the world's 850 million Moslems, revere <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as second only to God and view <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>, the prophet's father-in-law and the man who became Islam's first caliph, as his rightful successor The mystical Shiites consider <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s cousin and son-in-law, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the fourth caliph, and 11 of his descendants to be the true heirs of the faith. They revere all 12 as imams, or saints, and believe the 12th imam, <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON>, will return like a messiah to bring justice to the world. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was assassinated in 661 amid a power struggle by two factions over who would lead the Moslem world following <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s death confirmed the Sunni Umayyad dynasty in power as the Caliphs, or successors of the prophet. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s descendants remained in perpetual revolt, claiming to be the true Caliphate and refusing to accept orthodox teachings espoused by the Sunnis. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, led one rebellion and was massacred with his handful of outnumbered followers in the Battle of <LOCATION> Karbala </LOCATION>, in what is now <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in 680. Ever since, the minority Shiites were considered heretics. Only in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where for political motives a 16th century shah embraced <PERSON> Shiitism </PERSON> as the established creed, did the downtrodden sect flourish. Every year, when they mark the death of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, militant Shiites flagellate themselves with chains and swords in a passionate celebration of the martyr _ acts which Sunnis regard as demeaning. For <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and his followers, their revolution was the dawn of a new age of Islamic fundamentalism as a powerful force in the world, the time of reckoning after 1,300 years of subjugation. The revival stems in part from Moslems rebelling against the Western influence that colonialism brought and oil wealth intensified in the last two decades, transforming what were feudal societies and eroding cultural values. In this vacuum, fundamentalism has taken root. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s belief that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is the beacon for a fundamentalist revival that will sweep the world and his drive to export the revolution has caused mayhem among the monarchies of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> who believe themselves vulnerable. The Iran-Iraq war has only heightened the passions. Tiny <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which is closest to the war zone and under constant threat from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has cracked down hard on its <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militants after a chain of terrorist attacks, including the April 5 hijacking of a Kuwaiti jetliner by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremists. On Sunday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> called for the government to deport Shiite Moslems who show allegiance to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Shiites comprise about one-fourth of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s 1.9 million population. In <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, where Sunnis rule, the Shiites form about 70 percent of the population. Seven years ago, <LOCATION> Bahraini </LOCATION> authorities foiled what apparently was a Shiite plot aimed at assassinating the ruler, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Isa </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulman </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Khalifa </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A Polish official, responding to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration criticism of a crackdown on labor unrest, denied Sunday that strikers were beaten and said a government that fired its air traffic controllers should know the difference between a legal and an illegal strike. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON>, Polish government political adviser, denied news reports and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government allegations of violence against striking workers at a <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> steel mill and accused the news media of exaggerating and inflaming conditions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The strike was crushed, but nobody was beaten,'' <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said in an interview from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` If it all were true what your news media is reporting, we would have a general strike, a nationwide strike of 10 days or perhaps three months,'' <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said. At least five strikes have occurred in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the past two weeks, including one at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard where negotiations were continuing between workers and management. Asked about the reported use of percussion grenades to quell the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> strike, which had lasted 10 days, <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said he did not believe the devices were used but added, `` I can not rule it out.'' Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> condemned the reported violence Saturday and announced that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic recovery program would remain frozen until the program wins popular support. The White House twice last week also issued statements condemning the government's reported use of force against strikes backed by the outlawed Solidarity labor movement. <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> did not directly respond to the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism. But he said, `` You know, a country which not long ago had a certain experience with its air traffic controllers union ... should make a clear-cut difference between a strike which is legal ... and wildcat strikes, which as you know very well are illegal.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired striking air traffic controllers after what the government said was an illegal strike in 1981. <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON> said strikes represent problems with adaptation to `` the new style of our economic life.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last September, had applauded Polish steps toward economic reform prior to the current unrest. In March, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was posted in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for the first time in five years.

 Sikh militants wearing police uniforms and riding a motorcyle riddled a Hindu wedding party with automatic gunfire in one of several overnight attacks that killed 24 people, police said Sunday. An Indian border patrol killed five Sikh separatists on horseback in a river bank shootout, a news agency said. A border patrolman was also killed. In the most deadly attack Saturday night, Sikh militants opened fire from a motorcycle on the roadside wedding party of Hindu migrants. They killed 13 people and wounded 25, but the bride and groom were uninjured, police said. The attack occurred in predominantly Hindu <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state, which borders the mostly Sikh northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> where separatists have been blamed for killing about 940 people this year. They have been waging a guerrilla war for greater autonomy or an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1982. The <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> attack took place near the village of <LOCATION> Panipat </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, capital of both <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> states. A motorcycle carrying three Sikhs sped past the wedding party, and at least two men opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles, according to <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> police subinspector <PERSON> Ravinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakkar </PERSON>. Other Sikhs in a car rode near the motorcycle but did not fire, he said. The attack occurred shortly after the daughter of an intinerant metalworker was married to a man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The wedding party was eating and watching a video movie when they were raked with gunfire. All the assailants escaped. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, 11 people were killed Saturday night in several other attacks that police blamed on militant Sikhs. Near the Pakistani border, the Indian patrol operating on a tip raided a garden Sunday and surprised a band of armed militants, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Five Sikhs fled on horses along a river bank and were killed after a heavy exchange of gunfire, the report said. One was identified as <PERSON> Surjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who police said masterminded the massacre of 34 people at a festival March 3. Border guards killed another militant in a separate episode nearby, according to the report. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> also said Sikh gunmen killed a Hindu man, his son, daughter-in-law and grandson Saturday night in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Lakhan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kalan </LOCATION>. Two Hindu servants also were killed. Farther southeast, four Sikhs, including a village holy man, were killed by militants Saturday night in <LOCATION> Jalandar </LOCATION> district. The news agency reported that Sikh militants also killed a farmer in <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> district. Although a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s national population of 800 million. The Sikhs, whose religion began 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, who comprise about 80 percent of the country's population.

 Soviet police on Sunday tried to interrupt meetings of scores of dissidents seeking to challenge the supremacy of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and detained 20 people as they left one of the gatherings, dissidents said. Editors of 30 non-official journals hoping to break the government monopoly on publishing also met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to formalize their cooperation by establishing the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, 148 people attended an initial meeting to form an alternative political party called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, they broke into groups to discuss the party's political platform and socio-economic and organizational questions. <PERSON> Yevgeniya </PERSON> <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON>, who hosted the meeting about the group's political platform, said police arrived at her north <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment in about 30 cars Sunday evening and tried to enter About 50 people were jammed in Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON>'s living room, thrashing out the group's political goals. Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON> said the group refused to let officers in, but 20 people were detained as they left. She said in a telephone interview that she did not know what happened to them, but noted that authorities often hold people for several hours and then release them. Smaller groups discussed the party's organization and socio-economic policies at two other <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartments. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsarkov </PERSON>, leader of the organizational meeting, said a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city official accompanied by police arrived at the meeting and asked that the group of 15 disband. Police asked to check their documents, but the participants refused and police eventually left, <PERSON> Tsarkov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliseyedko </PERSON>, head of the group on socio-economic problems, said police also visited that meeting and checked documents, but otherwise did not interfere. Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON> said in an interview earlier Sunday that a committee of 15 people had drafted political principles calling for: _ Multi-party, parliamentary democracy; _ A new constitution, replacing the current document that makes the Communist Party the `` leading and guiding force'' of Soviet society; _ Independent trade unions; and _ Withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from Eastern European countries and from the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and the Baltic states, which Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON> said the group considers to be under Soviet occupation. The meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the independent publishers group were were notable for the number of people they drew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Authorities have not broken up previous efforts to hold dissident conferences, but they have closed conference facilities and prevented some people from traveling to them. Many dissident groups and independent publications have sprung up since hundreds of political prisoners were freed in 1987. Authorities in the past have crushed efforts to form an opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and despite his reform effort, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has given no indication the party will tolerate any opposition. Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will allow the group to exist if he is serious about reforms. `` Arguments and disagreements are normal in society,'' she said. But any such group also faces enormous difficulties in a vast country where the government controls printing facilities and authorities can detain or intimidate dissidents and disrupt mail and telephone calls. On Saturday, dissident sources said police surrounded the apartment building across the street from the government offices of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> republic, where the first meeting was held, but did not break it up. Ms. <PERSON> Debryanskaya </PERSON> said her group will make a formal declaration seeking official recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and transmit it to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city authorities. She has been active in a group supporting greater trust between East and West, and a second group calling itself `` Democracy and Humanism.'' Former political prisoners <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, and other publishers of independent journals from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pskov </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kuybyshev </PERSON> decided at their weekend gatherings to form a library to preserve and help disseminate their publications. Thirty publications emphasizing such topics as political commentary, religion and women's issues were represented, participants said. A similar meeting was held in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> last fall, and the group agreed to hold another large conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in October. Some of the publications have sought official approval, but none has been given. Participants in the editors' gathering said police checked documents of people who arrived at the south <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment on Saturday, but no police or plainclothes officers were visible Sunday.

<HEAD>Civil Libertarian Says Coast Guard Drug Policy Unfair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The weekend seizure of a $ 2.5 million yacht after less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana was found on board is a headline-grabbing scare tactic that violates common sense, a civil libertarian said Sunday. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s seizure of boats like the 133-foot Ark Royal was meant to make an impact. `` This new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our waterways,'' <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said when he announced the `` Zero Tolerance'' policy here two weeks ago. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the policy sets a dangerous precedent. `` To take somebody's property from them for something they probably could n't control'' is excessive, she said Sunday. The Ark Royal, registered in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and operated only by a crew of six employees, was boarded Saturday in international waters in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Neither its registered owner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, described by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> as the president and chief shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Tomima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, nor any passengers were on board, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>. A boarding party from the cutter <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> noticed a tiny bit of marijuana residue in a trash can during a friendly document check. The resulting search revealed a little marijuana tucked in the dresser of a stateroom, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. `` At this point the person who owned the contraband has not come forward,'' <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said. The crew will probably be released uncharged when they arrive at the <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station, expected during the night, he said. The yacht was to be impounded. `` We have been focusing all of our efforts in recent years on just the big smugglers, but drugs are a two-way street,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. `` This is the time we're making the users pay. It really has to hurt to see a luxury yacht taken away for what basically amounts to one joint.'' Asked if it did n't seem harsh to take away the boat under those circumstances, <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said, `` Zero tolerance means exactly that, without regards to the size of the vessel or of value of the vessel.'' `` A U.S.-flagged vessel is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory anywhere in the world. We have authority to enforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws over that vessel anywhere in the world except in the territorial seas of a foreign state. Even then we may be granted authority by that foreign state,'' <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is stretching the law with its seizure policy, said Ms. <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have passed a law that permits confiscation of property used in drug trafficking, but `` that's not the same as saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had in mind that they would have a Zero Tolerance policy,'' she said. It violates a sense of `` proportionality,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON> said. `` It's putting people at enormous risk with no very effective way of protecting themselves, and as a civil libertarian I am troubled by that kind of policy.'' `` My guess is the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is going to fight pretty hard on this one,'' she said. `` It's going to have enormous symbolic value.'' The previously most-expensive vessel confiscated under the program was a $ 300,000 yacht seized off <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. Efforts to reach <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON> for comment Sunday were unsuccessful. There was no listing under that name in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. There was a person with that name in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, but he had an unlisted number. Efforts to find a listing for a <ORGANIZATION> Tomima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were also unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Mothers Day Sets Stage For Vigil Seeking Greater Role, Priesthood
For Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Protesters denouncing the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s `` hypocrisy'' of honoring women on Mother's Day while denying them the priesthood staged a peaceful vigil Sunday outside Holy Name Cathedral A smaller group of demonstrators, some carrying pictures of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, gathered to reinforce church teachings that women can not be priests. About 40 members and supporters of a group called <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> stood outside the cathedral, home pulpit of Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON>, holding signs including one which said: `` We want a church for our daughters.'' The demonstrators, who included a handful of men, passed out fliers urging parishioners to boycott regular services and to attend an alternate service later at a North Side women's center. `` There's something to tradition,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, 35, who was carrying her 10-month-old son, <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>. `` There's also something to ending an unjust system.'' Another demonstrator was <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Woodridge </LOCATION>, who said she has a master's degree in divinity from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and would likely go into the priesthood if allowed. `` I'm ready,'' she said. `` My church is not.'' Hundreds of parishioners and visitors attended the morning Mother's Day Mass inside Holy Name while the demonstrators stood outside. <PERSON> Nanci </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhoefer </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was among about 10 demonstrators against ordination of women. `` Tradition is a very strong part of our church,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mayhoefer </PERSON> said. In performing part of the church service, the priest `` takes the place of Christ,'' and a woman ca n't play that role, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the vigil was planned because the issue of women and the church is `` tearing the church apart'' and was not given serious consideration by bishops who attended last fall's Synod on the Laity at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Her group's flier said the church shows `` hypocrisy'' on Mother's Day. `` This is the day on which the institutional church ` honors' its women,'' it said. `` By our absence we hope to demonstrate our frustration with such tokenism.'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoll </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, issued a statement on the issue before Sunday's protest. `` The recent pastoral letter by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops responding to the concerns of women clearly acknowledges that more needs to be done to recognize and incorporate the insights and talents of women as partners in the church,'' she said. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON>, 42, a parishioner from Olympia Fields, seemed to agree with the archdiocese view. `` For some families, it's really one time to get together,'' she said of Mother's Day. The demonstration, she said, `` takes away from it.'' But another parishioner, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Malewicki </PERSON>, 46, of <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, was not offended. `` I think there's merit in what they have to say, and it should be talked about, not dismissed,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON> does n't think there's anything special about a blind person riding a horse in a national college equestrian competition But she had to fight for a chance to prove that. The blind <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student has been riding horses, using her sense of hearing to guide her, since she was 10 years old. `` It's easy. I can hear the horse's feet echo off the rail,'' Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>, 19, said in a telephone interview Sunday from her hotel room in <LOCATION> Laurinburg </LOCATION>, site of Sunday's 15th Intercollegiate National Championship Horse Show. Later in the day, she placed fourth out of 12 riders in the walk-trot equitation class. A day earlier, the freshman persuaded organizers to reverse their earlier decision and let her compete. Although she qualified for the competition by winning a regional collegiate contest last month in <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, organizers last week disqualified her from the national show, saying a blind rider could be dangerous to other riders. The ruling surprised <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>, who has competed for two semesters on the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> equestrian team. `` You see, I've never been kept out of anything before _ not even when I was a kid,'' she said. She competes in a type of riding called `` hunt seat,'' in which riders in traditional English-style attire demonstrate various gaits as they go around the show ring and are judged on their form. She said she's tried her hand at jumping, but only in practice sessions. The disqualification also surprised her parents and teammates on the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> equestrian squad, who accompanied her to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Friday to protest the ruling. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> branch of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> also came to her aid, calling the disqualification discriminatory. An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Intercollegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the initial decision to disqualify Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON> was based primarily on insurance concerns and the safety of other riders. `` Discrimination is not at issue,'' said attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCrate </PERSON>. About 260 riders from colleges around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> competed Saturday and Sunday in the event at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said she usually competes with `` spotters,'' people posted around the horse show ring to warn her of corners and obstacles. Show officials ruled Thursday that the spotters violated competition rules, while <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>'s riding without them might endanger other riders. But on Saturday, after putting Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON> and her mount through paces in a private corral at the horse show farm, the show officials relented. They decided to let a friend of Miss <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON> run alongside her while she rode in the show ring in the walk-trot class, but without any verbal communication between horsewoman and helper. `` She certainly is comfortable on a horse. It went very, very smoothly yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, who owns the farm where the show was held and coaches the equestrian team at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>, who has been blind since birth, said she mounted her first horse at age 10 at a riding academy near her home. She quickly adjusted to the different gaits, while her sense of hearing and the riding instructor helped her guide the animal. Later, she practiced on the family horse, <PERSON> Rhannon </PERSON>, riding at home in a large circle at the end of a long rope held by her father. `` I know <PERSON> Rhannon </PERSON>'s gaits really well,'' she said. `` But I've ridden strange horses so many times. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said he was glad show officials finally recognized Miss <PERSON> Knouse </PERSON>'s rights `` At first, like most people, they just did n't see how she could do it,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` But I think a fair evaluation with a sensitivity to her efforts to overcome her blindness was all she ever asked for.''

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, on Sunday portrayed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a hesitant and unassertive chief executive controlled by a scheming, image-conscious first lady who depended heavily upon an astrologer's stargazing predictions. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> offered a sometimes bitter account of his stormy days at the White House in a memoir, `` For the Record: From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' published by <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> and scheduled to go on sale in bookstores on Monday. `` Virtually ever major move and decision the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignments for the enterprise,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. He did not identify the woman, saying <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to her only as `` Friend.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, which carried excerpts of the book in its new issue, said, `` She is Nob Hill Socialite <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, sixtyish, a <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> graduate who has written three books on astrology.'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a wealthy Republican whose specialty is politics, is a frequent guest on the <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> show. She has been practicing astrology since the 1960s and has written several books on the subject. Reached by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> last week on vacation in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, she acknowledged she has known the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for years, but refused to comment on whether they had ever been her clients. `` I never say who my clients are. Never. It is very confidential,'' she said. Asked if it would be wrong to say she was the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' astrologer, she said: `` I wo n't comment on that I ca n't comment.'' The Reagans had no comment Sunday afternoon when they alighted from the helicopter that brought them from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where they had spent the weekend. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed to his ear, indicating he could not hear questions shouted at him by reporters; Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared cool and unsmiling, but said nothing. On Friday, however, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expressed irritation about <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, the latest in a series of `` kiss and tell'' books about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency `` He's chosen to attack my wife and I do n't look kindly upon that at all,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said For a time, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> says he was kept in the dark about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secret, closely held by a handful of aides since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s days as the governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> But after repeated clashes with the first lady over schedules, longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> told the chief of staff about the woman and advised <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to `` humor'' the first lady, he said. `` At one point, I kept a color-coded calendar on my desk -LRB- numerals highlighted in green ink for ` good' days, red for ` bad' days, yellow for ` iffy' days -RRB- as an aid to remembering when it was propitious to move the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from one place to another, or schedule him to speak in public, or commence negotiations with a foreign power,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> liked to chat with the woman every Saturday from Camp David, he said. The advice from the soothsayer, coupled with a concern by <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the president's health that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> described as `` excessive,'' caused particular problems when the Iran-Contra scandal broke and prostate surgery required a time of recuperation, the former chief of staff recalled. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> described Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as presiding over `` a shadowy distaff presidency'' and using `` adroit guerrilla actions'' to achieve goals in `` a genuine belief that she was the best judge of her husband's interests.'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> regarded herself as the president's alter ego not only in the conjugal but also in the political and official dimensions, as if the office that had been bestowed upon her husband by the people somehow fell into the category of worldly goods covered by the marriage vows,'' he wrote. `` The president's view of the situation was never discussed,'' he said. `` The fact that he permitted it to exist, and that he never reversed any of the situations created by his wife's intervention, was regarded as sufficient evidence that he was willing to tolerate the state of affairs. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> pressed the first lady to allow the president to speak out on the Iran-Contra affair, telling her, `` We need a press conference, public appearances, speeches.'' `` A full month after the president's release from the hospital, his schedule was still a dead letter because Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ` Friend' had not provided a list of auspicious days The whole month appeared inauspicious for the president,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. After consulting with her `` Friend,'' the first lady provided some possible dates, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. But her advice was not always heeded. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appeared to want to delay the president's July 1985 surgery for suspected cancer of the colon because of her astrological concerns, but the president overruled any delay. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quoted the president saying, `` Why wait? Do the test and go ahead with the operation.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s influence hardly stopped at such lesser matters as scheduling trips or speeches, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. In his account, she was the one who decreed that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> be barred from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hospital bed for days following his cancer surgery. And the president's longtime friendship with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> did not prevent the first lady from pressing for his ouster, even as he lay recuperating from brain cancer surgery at Christmastime 1986, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> contended in one of his many descriptions of their telephone conversations. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had already shown signs of irritability, now became angry. ... ` You're more interested in protecting <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> than in protecting <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>!' she cried. ` He's got to go. He ca n't do his job; he's an embarrassment to <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. He should be out,''' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quoted the first lady as insisting. And, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted, the first lady not only chose the speech writer for such vital addresses as the State of the Union, but also heavily edited them. `` I do n't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' he quotes Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying when she demanded that passages referring to abortion be deleted. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> contended he was ousted by an effort organized at the hands of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and several of her close associates, and he barely has a kind word for the first lady in the 379-page book. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a president who `` laid down no rules and articulated no mission.'' At the same time, he told of instances in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held lengthy discussions with aides on complicated legislation, bills or administration efforts to push budget cuts through <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> emerged in the book as <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s foremost target. He paints her as an easily irritated `` constant telephone presence,'' who constantly meddled in administration affairs.

<HEAD>Irish Prison Guards Vote to End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prison guards voted by a huge majority Sunday to end their first national strike after three weeks. The 1,900 guards struck April 15 in a dispute over scheduling. The government used 1,000 police officers and 300 soldiers as temporary guards. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the guards voted 1,140-159 to accept an offer for an independent review of new shift arrangements. Irish Justice Minister <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> welcomed Sunday's vote and said talks would be held with guards Monday to arrange a return to work. The union had said the shifts were imposed without consultation. It also said it wanted government money earmarked for overtime to be used instead to recruit more prison staff. But the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said the dispute centered on a demand by guards for compensation for overtime payments they lost last year when extra prison staff was recruited. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 11 prisons house about 2,000 inmates.

 The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday temporarily blocked the deportation of an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience and gave the government three days to explain its expulsion order. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, protests erupted over army orders that 300,000 Palestinians obtain new identity cards. An Israeli Cabinet member called for legislation limiting the defense minister's powers to order military actions. The move came after last week's Israeli incursion into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in which three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers died. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Shoshana </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> delayed for three days the deportation order against <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who filed his appeal Sunday. He was to have been deported at midnight. Ms. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> ordered the government to explain its order and also scheduled a hearing Monday on a request that Awad be released from jail, court spokesman <PERSON> Shmaryahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Awad has been on a hunger strike since his arrest Thursday. In a statement, he said he was defending `` the right of all Jerusalemites to continue to live peacefully in their homeland regardless of their opinions.'' `` For Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to say that I, a Christian, will be forever prevented from returning to my city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to pray in my holy places is totally unacceptable,'' he said. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, read the statement to reporters. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> a personal message protesting the deportation order against <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a proponent of non-violent resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the report, and a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the prime minister had not received <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s message. The Israeli government has accused <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, of inciting violence during the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. By <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count, 184 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed since the violence began Dec. 8. On Friday, after issuing the deportation order, the government alleged <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> helped prepare leaflets urging youths to throw firebombs and stones. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, said the appeal was based primarily on `` the inherent right of Jerusalemites, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, to continue to reside in -LRB- Arab -RRB- east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' The Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1968 and returned in 1985 to found the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-Violence. The government refused to renew his Israeli-issued residence permit last August. In November, the government also rejected his plea for the renewal of a tourist visa. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has pressured <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> not to appeal the deportation because such a move would imply acceptance of Israeli rule. When asked about the report, <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said only that the existence of differing opinions in the Palestinian community was well known. Demonstrations broke out in at least six towns and refugee camps in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> against military orders that residents apply for new ID cards. The military has seized cards to force residents to pay back taxes, utility bills and other government fees. Non-payment of taxes and other fees is a major tactic in the uprising. Palestinians in the occupied territories are required to carry the cards at all times. They are frequently stopped by soldiers and asked to show them and are subject to arrest if caught without a card. In the Beach refugee camp, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters. At least 23 people were treated at the camp's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic and nearby <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospital for injuries and the effects of tear gas, doctors said. A military source denied the new rules were designed to force people to pay the outstanding bills. `` It's time to replace the ID cards because there are many old ones, torn ones, without pictures. You can not see exactly what's written on them,'' said the source, who spoke on condtion of anonymity The source said cards would only be renewed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, not in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. Scattered Palestinian protests were reported in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse about 200 Arabs in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. During Sunday's regular Cabinet meeting, Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> proposed draft legislation aimed at limiting the defense minister's powers to decide on military operations without consulting the 24-member Cabinet. Cabinet members have complained that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, also a Labor member, did not inform them of the scope of the army's <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> action last week. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and several other Cabinet members defended the action, saying it stayed within the framework of defending <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border

<HEAD>Banks To Allow Limited Withdrawals For First Time in Nine Weeks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under government pressure, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks prepared to allow customers to make limited withdrawals from their accounts Monday for the first time in more than nine weeks A government order shut down banks on March 3 following a run on savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions in an effort to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as commander of the Defense Forces. The sanctions, including the freezing of an estimated $ 50 million of government funds in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts, helped produce a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. After rejecting earlier government orders to resume operations with restrictions, some financial institutions agreed to reopen on April 18 to accept deposits. A week later, the government allowed them to expand transactions, but cash withdrawals were still barred. Meanwhile, the government refused to allow <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> to re-enter the country. He had recently arranged bail for some members of the opposition National Civic Crusade. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Marcela </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, said her husband was put on a plane leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> when he tried to return Saturday from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was taken to a security office and told `` absolutely nothing'' before he was expelled. Some Civic Crusade leaders have been hiding for weeks after security forces raided their offices and homes. Several opposition leaders have been refused re-entry or expelled during the 11-month-long political crisis and then allowed to return later. Panamanians, unable to cash their paychecks, have conducted business on a barter or cash-only basis since the closing of the banks. Public employees have received government checks in small denominations which they can use to buy groceries or pay utility bills. Supermarkets that take the checks use them to pay utility bills and taxes. Bankers and government officials agreed after a series of negotiations to resume limited withdrawals beginning Monday. Some bankers said the compromise was little more than an attempt to produce the image of business as usual since the cash crisis has not eased. The banks `` will be open, but they will not be open,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Felliu </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Rules issued by the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> limit the amount Panamanians will be able to withdraw from checking accounts to 25 percent of the balance on March 3 with a maximum of $ 10,000. Money deposited after April 18 is to be free of restrictions. Withdrawals from savings accounts are to be limited to $ 50, beginning a month after the reopening. Withdrawals of interest are unrestricted. All withdrawals are subject to the availability of cash at the individual bank. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Caja </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahorro </ORGANIZATION> bank announced it would not cash checks for the time being. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, which normally honors government checks, also said it would not pay out cash. The <ORGANIZATION> Panamana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 93 of the 117 banks, most of them foreign, previously insisted its members would not resume full services unless the government could assure an adequate supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars to back normal customer and commercial transactions. Some bankers said they would abide by the agreement but insisted that conditions still did not exist for full-service operations. `` If that is their thinking, they are part of the aggression against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said on Friday. Two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted the general in February on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the charges and said they are politically motivated. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis worsened after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls the civilian government, had the legislature depose President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, the day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general as commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as president and imposed the sanctions.

 A man accused in 16 deaths, including the Christmastime slaughter of 14 relatives, will go to trial first for the two killings outside his family. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 47, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> master sergeant, is charged with two counts of capital murder in the Dec. 28 shooting spree in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> in which six people were shot by a gunman wielding two .22 caliber pistols. Two of the victims died. In his trial, which begins Monday, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> could be sentenced to die or to life in prison without parole if convicted of either count of capital murder. He also will be tried on five counts of attempted capital murder and one of kidnapping. The defense will ask Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> to dismiss the attempted capital murder counts on grounds that, under <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> law, they are superseded by the capital murder counts, according to defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Following the shooting spree, 14 members of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> family were found slaughtered. Charges from the slaying of the family are to be tried later. The 16 deaths made it one of the worst mass slayings in American history. The case was moved to <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION> after the defense argued that there had been so much pretrial publicity that it would be difficult to get an unprejudiced jury in <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, 47 miles west of here. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> declined to say whether <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> would testify. The attorney said Sunday that he had no plans `` at this time'' to raise insanity as a defense. Tests on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> found no evidence of a problem such as a brain tumor that could have affected his behavior. After his arrest, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was was found by doctors to be legally sane and thus able to stand trial. Moments before he surrendered Dec. 28, police said, the gunman told his hostage: `` I've gotten everybody who wanted to hurt me. I've come to do what I wanted to do. It's all over now.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> will be on trial for the deaths of <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 24, who police say once spurned <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' romantic advances, and of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON>, 33, who police say was a chance victim. Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> was shot in the head at a <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> law office where she was a legal secretary. <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> was slain at an oil company where the gunman wounded the oil company owner. To be tried later are two capital murder charges, one accusing <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> of killing seven relatives, the other accusing him of killing seven other relatives. There are two groups of seven because authorities believe the killings took place at different times. After <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was arrested, sheriff's deputies found the bodies of five relatives, including two of his children and their spouses. Four of the victims had been shot and the other victim, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' 11-year-old granddaughter, had been strangled They apparently died after they arrived for a Christmas season family gathering, police said. The next day, police dug into a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave and found seven bodies, including those of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' other children and his wife, <PERSON> Becky </PERSON>. She had told family members in a letter `` I am a prisoner here, and the kids, too.'' Police said that some of these victims had been shot, others strangled, apparently before Christmas _ gift packages were unopened beneath the Christmas tree. Police also found the bodies of two infant boys in garbage sacks in the trunks of abandoned cars on <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> property. They were strangled. The gun that killed Miss <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chaffin </PERSON> had been used to kill some of <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' relatives, state ballistics experts said.

 Scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> are developing a robot that will test clothing for the Army by crawling, panting and even sweating. The life-sized robot, nicknamed <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>, is being made by <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> scientists in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, so the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> can see how protective clothing worn by troops reacts to harsh conditions, such as heat, cold, high humidity, smoke, fire and chemical attack. Development costs have been about $ 2 million. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, spokesman for the Columbus-based institute, said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> is scheduled for delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Dugway Proving Ground in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> this fall. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> engineer who developed the robot, said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> has 40 articulated joints that allow movement and stress testing of the clothing. The robot can walk, bend over, squat, drop to all fours and crawl. Robot testing gives more precise information on body and clothing stress than is possible with humans, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>'s trials will be limited to the laboratory at Dugway, because the robot is connected by an electronic cord to a computer. The robot's artificial skin will be sensitive to changes in temperature or exposure to chemicals. During exertion, breath will be simulated by expansion and contraction of the chest and the exhalation of moist air. Perspiration is simulated by the release of water from small tubes on the robot's body. The robot has to breathe and perspire to simulate the buildup of moisture between the clothing and the skin. Since <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> exudes pure water, he has no body odor, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` Actually, he smells pretty good so far,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said he told Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dependence on astrological advice while they were discussing the president's schedule just after the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report was issued in February 1987. He says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` listened ... with surprise and consternation on his face'' and exclaimed, `` Good God. I had no idea.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a reluctant decision-maker. `` He listened, encouraged, deferred,'' he wrote. `` But it was a rare meeting in which he made a decision or issued orders.'' `` Never did he issue a direct order, although I, at least, sometimes devoutly wished that he would,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> added. `` He listened, acquiesced, played his role, and waited for the next act to be written.'' `` In the four years that I served as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, I never saw President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alone and never discussed economic philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal and monetary policy with him man to man. `` From first day to last at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, I was flying by the seat of my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches and reading the newspapers.'' While critical of the president's hands-off style, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> also commented that such a laid-back presidency created `` an atmosphere of confidence and political dynamism.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> stressed, that in the president's mind, there was never a swap of arms for hostages at the time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was sending weapons to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> first mentioned establishing ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during a fateful July 18, 1985, meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> following his colon cancer surgery. The former chief of staff contended that, contrary to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, there was no mention of an arms-for-hostages deal. In fact, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> called the meeting `` routine in memory,'' and contended he might not even have remembered it `` if I had n't had such a difficult time persuading his -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s -RRB- wife to let it take place.'' `` There is nothing in my notes or memory to suggest that the idea of swapping arms for hostages was mentioned by either man on this occasion. ... I am sure that any mention of such a scheme would have made me prick up my ears,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. The former chief of staff said he believes the president's contention that he knew nothing of the diversion of funds to the Contra rebels until told about it by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Nov. 25, 1986 `` The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He blanched when he heard <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s words. The color drained from his face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the president's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that he knew about the diversion of funds before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told him about it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had happened.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former aides for the debacle that befell the president and ultimately engulfed himself. `` Much of what happened was hidden from the president -LRB- and incidentally from me -RRB- by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and his successor as national security adviser, Adm. -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and by the remarkable young Marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> wrote. `` As to the responsibility for the chaos that descended on the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, that appears to have been written in the stars,'' he wrote. He said that he urged the president to counteract the effects of the Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but was balked by astrological advice to the first lady that `` harm would come to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if he went out of the White House.'' `` By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was first told the details of the proposed arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, during the November 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Although he listened intently to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s words, the president asked few questions,'' he wrote. `` He looked straight at McFarlane, occasionally glancing at -LRB- Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> or me as if to study our reactions.'' He says <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` commented very sparingly'' during the 20-minute meeting and the president ended by `` once again saying yes by not saying no.'' The former chief of staff indicated the meeting was typical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s style. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> related a stormy conversation between himself and the president on the day he found himself suddenly replaced by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as chief of staff. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed to persuade him to stay on and work with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during the transition. As <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> described it, he said, `` I'm sorry, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, but I wo n't be in any more. This is my last day. I've been your secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for four years and your chief of staff for two. You do n't trust me enough even to tell me who my successor is and make a smooth transfer. I deserved better treatment than this. I'm through. I'm very disappointed.'' Despite their difficult parting, he wrote, `` my admiration for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as president remains very great.'' `` My judgment of him as a man, in light of my final experience as his chief of staff, underwent a certain change, but this is irrelevant,'' he said. `` Any man who had seen as much of the world as I had seen when I came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> knew better than to put his trust in princes.''

 A 9-year-old boy was arrested for allegedly selling cocaine supplied to him by adults, police said. `` Lots of kids sell drugs,'' the unidentified boy reportedly told officers after being taken into custody Saturday. `` For every five buyers, they -LRB- suppliers -RRB- give me $ 50,'' he said.

Police went to the city's <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section area Friday night after receiving reports of a young boy who was selling drugs and carrying a gun. The boy was spotted in front of an apartment building and turned to flee when the officers approached, but he stopped in his tracks when ordered to halt, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have a gun, just this package,'' the boy told officers as he reached inside his pants pocket and brought out a package of what he said was cocaine.

 Rival Shiite Moslem militias ended a 16-hour truce Sunday, fighting each other with tanks, mortars and truck-mounted rocket launchers in battles that killed seven people and wounded 25, police said. The toll from three days of fighting rose to 89 dead and 242 wounded following the breakdown of an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> - and Syrian-brokered cease-fire Police said hostilities broke out in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s densely populated districts of <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION>, Bir el-Abed and <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON> and quickly spread to five adjacent neighborhoods. The fighting has included gunbattles inside a hospital, where a doctor said militiamen forced surgeons to operate on dead comrades `` to bring them back to life.'' Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, accused each other of breaking the cease-fire. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for extremist factions holding many of the 18 kidnapped foreigners in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, some of whom are reportedly held in the embattled slums. It was not known if the fighting had any effect on the captives. The fighting was touched off Friday by a pre-dawn ambush in which four Amal militiamen were killed. Amal blamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. The thud of explosions and bursts of gunfire resounded across the city Sunday. Both sides mounted grenade-throwing assaults on each other's positions. Several apartment buildings were ablaze, but fire engines could not enter the area because of the fighting. Both sides went on a kidnapping spree, abducting at least 20 civilians suspected of sympathizing with either side. Police had said more than 100 other civilians have been abducted since the outbreak of the slums war. An Amal communique charged <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> gunmen were sniping at residential neighborhoods from rooftops of apartment buildings in the sprawling <LOCATION> Shiyah </LOCATION> district, and warned that this would spread the fighting. Shiyah abuts <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, which has sliced the capital into Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors since the 1975 outbreak of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. As the guns roared, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> dispatched its military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on an apparent mission to reinstate the cease-fire. <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> went into conference with <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> at his sandbagged residence in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Barbour </LOCATION> neighborhood, about five miles from the fighting. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON> also met acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>. A coalition of the nation's senior <LOCATION> Sunni </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> religious leaders called on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to send troops into the slums. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> deployed 7,500 troops in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Feb. 22, 1987 to curb the reign of feuding militias. The slums are outside the jurisdiction of that contingent. The short-lived lull, which began about midnight Saturday, allowed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and civil defense rescuers to evacuate scores of trapped victims. Hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood donations. An Iranian mission headed by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> also was trying to negotiate a new truce, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> said. During the lull Sunday morning, the slums' estimated 250,000 inhabitants of the slums began venturing from their basements and bomb shelters where they had been trapped for more than 50 hours. `` What have I done to deserve all this?'' asked <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabshoul </PERSON>, 34, a grocer, whose shop in <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> was reduced to a pile of rubble by shellfire. His wife and two children stood crying beside him. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Alameh </PERSON>, while taking stock of the damage to his perfume shop in an Amal-controlled neighborhood in <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION>, asked: `` Who is going to compensate me?'' When told that `` Allah'' -LRB- God -RRB- would, he retorted icily, `` Allah or his party?'' an apparent reference to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Many residents hurriedly packed up beds, mattresses and clothes, and drove away from the slums. Others installed new doors on damaged shops and houses. A doctor at al-Sahel hospital, which has received more than 100 casualties from both sides, said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> had clashed inside the building. `` We have been forced many times to flee and abandon victims because of frequent gunfights in the emergency ward,'' said the doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. She said doctors also had been forced at by frenzied gunmen to operate on dead comrades, `` telling us at gunpoint to bring them back to life.'' Police said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> appears to have made substantial territorial gains in the fighting around the <LOCATION> Ghobeiri </LOCATION> district that is home to the party's mentor, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>. But each side held its ground elsewhere. During the lull in the fighting, <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> issued a statement accusing <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> of turning the slums into a `` a nest of terror where kidnapped foreigners are held hostage.'' `` You are a war criminal,'' retorted <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in a statement released in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and addressed to <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>. `` Only spies of the Great Satan -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- call us terrorists.'' In a four-day confrontation last month, Amal crushed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> throughout south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said 62 people were killed and 150 wounded.

 A juror who `` was not coherent'' was replaced with an alternate Sunday during a fifth day of deliberations on whether <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> should die for the 1973 slayings of six members of one family. Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> excused the juror after a court deputy said the woman was not capable of continuing in <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s murder retrial for the <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> family deaths. The juror who was replaced appeared before the judge. Much of her testimony was inaudible. But she was heard to say several times: `` They put a bug in my ear. Remember <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> was the last of the six victims in the killing spree in <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on May 14, 1973. After five <PERSON> Alday </PERSON> men were shot to death one by one at <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>'s home, Mrs. <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, was taken to a nearby field where she was raped and killed A deputy assigned to watch the sequestered jurors told the judge that the juror `` was mumbling nonsense. She was not coherent. She is not physically or mentally capable to continue.'' The woman was the second juror to be replaced. Defense attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> moved again Sunday, as he has before, for <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> to declare the jury deadlocked. In such a case, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, whose original death sentence for the slayings was overturned on appeal, automatically would be sentenced to life in prison. He has served 15 years on his original conviction. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> again rejected the motion. The jurors convicted <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> on six counts of murder last Monday. On Wednesday, they began deliberating whether he should be sentenced to death or to life in prison. Attorneys in the case believe a minority of the jurors are holding out for a life sentence. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has given no indication when he might halt deliberations; on Saturday, he recharged the jurors and told them he wants them to reach a decision. After the Sunday court session, the jury resumed deliberations for a time before recessing for the day at midafternoon. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1974 for the May 14, 1973, killings of <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Alday </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>'s sons <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court in 1985 because of pretrial publicity. <PERSON> Isaacs </PERSON> was convicted a second time in January and again sentenced to death. <PERSON> Dungee </PERSON> is to be retried later in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is putting together a $ 10 billion international aid program for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a decrease in direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the financially troubled ally. The five-year plan, originally proposed by two Democratic and two Republican members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would gather new money and benefits for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from other nations, including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and European countries. Officials have not indicated what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share would be. The proposal, patterned after the 1947 <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Plan to rescue <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II, is being put together while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> face demands for big increases in payments for the use of key <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Philippine Foreign Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` rent'' for the bases should be increased from the current $ 180 million a year to as much as $ 1.2 billion annually and should be in addition to any other aid. Both congressional and administration officials have said that kind of money likely would not be available. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year appropriated $ 347 million for the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has asked that that be cut to $ 257 million in the next fiscal year budget. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday the administration is moving toward announcement of the international aid plan. The administration also plans to send a high-level special emissary to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to dramatize its concern for conditions in the country, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported on Sunday. The newspaper said a congressional delegation might accompany the official, who would deliver a pledge of top-level support and consult with <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on details of the program. The original proposal by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., and Reps. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called for at least $ 1 billion a year in new international aid to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government and proposed that a prominent American be appointed by the president to lead the The Post report said such an appointment was likely. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> economy has been showing signs of increased health since a popular uprising in February 1986 ended two decades of authoritarian rule by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and installed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. But the government has had to use much of its income to meet interest payments on its $ 26 billion foreign debt. The Post, citing unidentified sources, said the aid plan would include debt relief in the form of reduced payments or debt-equity swaps, trade preferences to encourage Philippine exports, and private investments from international financial institutions and businesses, in addition to direct aid.

 Gunfire and streetfighting flared again Sunday between ethnic Pakistanis and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> immigrants in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s largest city and at least 14 people were killed, officials reported. The deaths brought the number of people slain in 10 days of clashes to at least 30. A traffic accident in west <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> April 29 led to riots in the eastern and northern sections of this city of 7 million people. Both groups compete for blue-collar jobs in a city with high unemployment. Sunday's dead included at least four policemen killed when militant Pathans, who trace their roots to northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, attacked police headquarters in three working-class neighborhoods, according to the official APP news agency. It said the casualties included `` mohajirs'' _ Indian Moslems who emigrated to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was partitioned in 1947 _ but gave no figures. <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, a port city on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, has had ethnic violence for years. Several hundred people perished in riots in late 1986. Traffic accidents and other minor incidents often erupt into street battles. The troubled areas were reported calm Sunday night as army troops moved in to impose an indefinite curfew.

<HEAD>Americans Tend To Vote For The Optimistic Candidate, Researchers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In nine of the past 10 presidential elections, the candidate who avoided discussing problems and offered an optimistic outlook was the winner, according to researchers. They say those results are being borne out this year, because, of the pack of presidential hopefuls who began the race, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and apparent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered the rosiest messages. In analyzing nomination acceptance speeches of the two major-party candidates since 1948, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON>, psychologists at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, found the candidate who avoided dwelling on national and personal problems and characterized troubles with an optimistic outlook ended up in the White House _ except in 1968. That year, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, whose message rated slightly more upbeat than <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s, came from behind in the polls to a narrow defeat on Election Day, <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON> said. `` The danger is it tells a political candidate that if you shape statements to what they want to hear _ you'll win. ... An unscrupulous candidate can move further away from what he really means,'' <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> said. The correlation between the candidates' ratings in the analysis and their actual margins of victory or defeat came almost as close as is possible in social science, <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> said. The researchers applied their theory to the 13 major candidates running at the beginning of the year for the Democratic and Republican nominations by analyzing texts of their speeches as published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in January and February. The results of the study are due for publication in The American Psychologist, a psychology journal, later this year. The researchers counted the number of references to bad events or problems, then had people who were unaware of the source of the sentences rate them for pessimism and optimism. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came in as the optimism winner, followed by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the winner for the Republicans, with former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> behind him. Key to the high ratings for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON> said, was the low number of references to bad events. But also a major factor in the equation was their tendency to view the problems optimistically, citing forces outside the country or painting them as temporary troubles that would be overcome by a vote in their favor, he said. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign has been punctuated by a theme of hope, his speeches frequently have focused on the problems of American society and politics, <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tends to shy away more from discussing the country's problems, he said For instance, a passage from a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> speech about defense has him firmly blaming the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration but using strong language in describing perceived troubles, <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> put out the deal that we are weak militarily. That's not true. We're the strongest military in the world.'' But, he adds: `` Our boys got killed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ... Our boys are vulnerable in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, going up and down that river every day being looked at down the gun barrel of American made guns sold to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> illegally. We've got a strong military and a weak commander in chief.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> loses points in the analysis by rekindling the trauma of the 241 Marines and sailors killed by a car bomb in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the current threat to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, scored higher than the other party candidates by not dwelling on a problem and quickly looking to an optimistic future. `` Modern American voters seem to have a stable preference for candidates who are more hopeful,'' <PERSON> Zullow </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Wrangle Over Honorary Degree For Nelson Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has raised objections from some faculty and students. Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony. The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who is scheduled to be in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a benefit dinner. Law students last September began a campaign of demonstrations and vigils on the campus. They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: `` Honor <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>.'' Before he was imprisoned, said third-year law student <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was an ... attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid. That's the message we wanted conveyed to students.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-minority government says it will free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country. Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no effort was made to include them. `` I do n't even know what office is sponsoring it,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>, dean and director of the <ORGANIZATION> African-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a student group. `` We got a memo from the administration saying they need six ushers, but that's it. `` You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on.'' `` This started out as something noble, something we've tried to have done for three years,'' said <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON>. `` We are very, very sorry it happened this way. It was n't meant to turn out like this.'' The trustees decided in January that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> should get the honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s family to get their approval University spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said letters were sent to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, and his two daughters: <PERSON> Zenani </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Makaziwe </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. However, Northeastern still has not received approval from the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Mayor's Approval Rating Drops, According to New York Newsday Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s approval rating has dropped sharply because of his controversial comments during the recent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, with his standing suffering most among blacks, according to a poll released Sunday. The poll, conducted last week for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, found 43 percent approved of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s performance as mayor while 42 percent disapproved and 15 percent had no opinion. It was the first of five polls conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> in the past year that gave <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> an approval rating of less than 50 percent. The previous poll in December 1987 gave him a favorable rating of 55 percent. Only 21 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Hispanics gave <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> a favorable rating, down from 44 percent and 56 percent, respectively, in December. Fifty-three percent of whites approved of the mayor, including 61 percent of Jews, down from 59 percent and 65 percent, respectively, in December. During the campaign for last month's primary, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Jews and supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` would have to be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has met in the past with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. He also said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s proposed policies would leave the country bankrupt and defenseless. Fifty-two percent of those polled said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s rhetoric heightened racial tensions and 39 percent said they were less likely to vote for him as a result. Regarding the 1989 mayoral race, 49 percent said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> should not seek re-election to a fourth term and 40 percent said he should. In December, 45 percent said the mayor should seek re-election and 44 percent said he should not. Only 18 percent of blacks thought <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> should run for re-election, down from 40 percent in December, while 40 percent of <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> said he should run, down from 47 percent. Forty-nine percent of whites said he should run, including 59 percent of Jews, up from 47 percent and 56 percent, respectively, in December. The telephone poll surveyed 1,033 city residents and had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

<HEAD>It's Off To The Horse Races After Voting In Two Texas Counties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Texans have voted to authorize horse racing and pari-mutuel betting in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> counties, and in one small town's mayoral race a husband and wife ran against each other and both lost to a write-in vote. In unofficial returns from all precincts, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voters approved pari-mutuel betting 42,198 to 32,830, or 56 percent to 44 percent. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voters approved pari-mutuel 18,939, or 52 percent, to 17,541, or 48 percent in complete returns.

The <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> racing vote was a reversal of last November's election, when pari-mutuel won statewide despite a negative vote in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> county A leader of the anti-gambling forces said more money and stronger campaigning probably would n't have turned the tide. `` If we had been more visible it would just have increased the turnout,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Texans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Who </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, adding that greater numbers would probably work in favor of pro-gambling efforts. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> voters also approved by more than a 2-to-1 margin a proposal to build a new 12-story jail tower that would add 2,304 bunks to the county's jail capacity.

 Jury selection for the murder trial of a man who allegedly gunned down a judge and two others during a divorce hearing will start Monday at the scene of the crime. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> faces three first-degree murder counts in the July 28, 1987 shooting deaths at the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The best of the worst, the tops of the lowest, the most awful assaults on the art of writing were honored Sunday in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest. The top prize, the `` creme de la dreck,'' went to <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheeley </PERSON>, 20, a journalism student at <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` I'd hate to say that bad writing comes naturally, but my creative juices were flowing that day,'' <PERSON> Sheeley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Sunday. `` You have to get into a bad frame of mind.'' She said she is a would-be novelist, `` But I'm a pretty bad procrastinator, so for now I want to go into newspaper writing and have a deadline to write for.'' Whether a boon or bane for her career, the prize came from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, founder and `` grand panjandrum'' of the literary disgrace he calls `` the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> of literature.'' Despite the humor that surrounds its awarding, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> stresses that the competition is not a `` joke-writing contest. It really takes a very good writer to deliberately write bad.'' The contest trashes the battered memory of 19th century English writer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulwer-Lytton </PERSON>. His turgid style is captured in the opening line to one of his novels, later enshrined by <PERSON> Snoopy </PERSON>, the erudite pooch in the comic strip Peanuts: `` It was a dark and stormy night ...'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> notes that <PERSON> Bulwer-Lytton </PERSON> also is remembered for such ringing cliches as `` The pen is mightier than the sword'' and `` The Great Unwashed.'' This year's <ORGANIZATION> No-Ribbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Undistinguished </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> examined more than 11,000 entries, searching for the most miserable, least readable and rottenest lead sentence to the crummiest novel imaginable. This awful thing submitted by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheeley </PERSON> brought her to the top _ or the bottom _ of the heap: `` Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built, <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> was sleek, shapely and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding her body, which was as warm as the seatcovers in July, her hair as dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps, and her lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood; she was a woman driven _ fueled by a single accelerant _ and she needed a man, a man who would n't shift from his views, a man to steer her along the right road: a man like <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the contest is a gentle reminder to the world of letters that it is OK to lighten up, forget the grammar books for a minute and have some fun, to `` approach the language recreationally as well as practically.'' For her effort, <ORGANIZATION> Sheeley </ORGANIZATION> wins a word processor. Awards were also made in selected categories. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>, won in puns: `` Once a month, when the moon is full, Reverend <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleaker </PERSON> and his lovely wife <PERSON> Teddi </PERSON> invite members of the church to the parsonage for an evening of hymn singing, followed by cookies, tea, and a frenzied orgy on the lawn outside, making sure, of course, to take all the usual precautions for safe sects.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazulelwicz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, won for purple prose: `` The silent snow fell relentlessly, unceasingly, mercilessly from the sordid, sullied surreality of the sky as if some enormous, ethereal diner were shaking grated parmesan on the great, soggy meatball that was earth.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, won for science fiction: `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> doubted that her alien escort, composed as he was of vegetable matter, seaweed, and a thick coating of swampy muck, would be a suitable date for the Intergalactic kegger, but he turned out to be a real FUNGI.'' <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nottinghamshire </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, won for detective novel: `` With the radio squawking that a 4711 was in progress at 37th and 127th, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> knocked car 495 into 3rd and headed up 5th at 70, little reckoning, as he thumbed his .38, that this would be the day when his number came up.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car companies will see their share of the domestic auto market fall sharply in the next two years as Japanese companies increase their production here, a study has concluded. The management consulting firm of <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> predicted that domestic companies' share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto market would fall to 56 percent in 1990 from 68 percent last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s auto makers should hold more than 30 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market by 1990, the newspaper quoted the study as forecasting. The firm's industry analysts estimated Japanese-based companies would be building about 2.2 million cars a year in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants by 1990, the newspaper said. That equals the number of cars that the Japanese export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually under current voluntary restraints. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> build cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and three more Japanese companies plan to start production here by 1990. As a result of the competition, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will see their share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market shrink, the study said. `` It's going to be more and more difficult to define what is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company,'' the News quoted <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mateyka </PERSON>, a vice president of <PERSON> Booz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, as saying. `` After <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- adds its engine and transmission plants -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- will it be less American than <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>?'' he asked. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> has a final assembly plant in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and builds some engines in a former motorcycle factory also in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The study also predicted that new Japanese auto plants will add about 30,000 jobs by 1990, but not all will be unionized, the newspaper reported.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s impoverished `` gaucho'' country Sunday and voiced strong support for labor unions, but he warned against groups claiming to have all the answers to workers' problems The pope told a crowd of about 50,000 that he feels close `` in word and heart'' to those involved in union activities, an apparent reference to the labor unrest in his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On Saturday, during his flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> expressed approval of the Polish strikes. Cowboys on horseback, wearing flat-crowned black hats and blankets draped over their shoulders, lined the route to the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s prayer service in a red-canopied altar erected in a large park `` Those, who with zeal and sacrifice, seek to better the conditions of workers deserve unconditioned support,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. He said `` no ideology can claim to have a monopoly on solutions to social problems.'' The church, he said, `` can not allow any ideology or political group to snatch from it the flag of justice.'' This was a frequent theme on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s eight earlier visits to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, especially in places where Marxists challenge the established economic order. Although the pope did n't mention <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in his Melo remarks, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said he was following the situation there closely. An aide said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had been informed that his words of support Saturday were received with `` indescribable joy'' by striking workers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> flew the 250 miles to <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, his <ORGANIZATION> Uruguayan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet passed over herds of grazing cattle. But despite the cattle industry, <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> is one of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s poorest areas. The town of 39,000 people near the Brazilian border has been hit hard by unemployment. Referring to the distribution of wealth, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said those who own land and other property have an obligation to put their wealth to the benefit of the entire community. `` Private property includes a social mortgage,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> frequently cited the church's social teaching, including an encyclical he wrote in 1981 on the problems of work. The pope had cited that document as giving justification to the strikes taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The pope visited <PERSON> Melo </PERSON> on the second day of a 12-day, four country South American visit. At sunset, the pope led a Mass in a soccer stadium filled with 20,000 people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 68 miles north of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. He ordained 12 Uruguayan priests and one Argentine during the three-hour ceremony. There was a brief incident when the pope left a cleared path to touch hands with members of the crowd as he entered the stadium. Security personnel surrounding the pope, who was seriously wounded in a May 1981 assassination attempt in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, edged several people out of the way until he returned to the path. The pope reminded the crowd, including many teen-agers, of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s Christian origins and then told the newly ordained priests `` your task is enormous. You'll be in the center of the dialogue between God and mankind about salvation.'' Several people were allowed on the stage to present the pope with gifts including a tapestry and a fawn that the pontiff petted on the head. `` Our people, as you know well, need more priests,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> is considered the least religious country in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Its president is a self-proclaimed agnostic, divorce has been legal since 1907 and church and state have been separated for 61 years. In <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, a Polish-Jewish survivor of a Nazi concentration camp in World War II said Sunday that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> embraced him with `` great emotion'' upon meeting him and hearing his story. <PERSON> Chil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajman </PERSON>, 75, now an Uruguayan citizen, said that during a brief meeting Saturday night between the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and members of this country's small Jewish community, he mentioned that he had been in the German-run death camp in <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The pope grasped my hand with great emotion and said to me: ` You were in <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> and you survived,''' <PERSON> Rajman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sclofsky </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that during the meeting, at <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, `` the pope asked how many Jews there are here and if we practice our faith freely.'' <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, with about 50,000 Jews among its 3 million inhabitants, guarantees the freedom of all religions. Although most Uruguayans are nominally Catholic, the country rigorously separates church and government in all areas. The pope's itinerary included two days in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> before flying Monday to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> for five days and then visiting <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 18, his 68th birthday. This is his 37th foreign trip since becoming <PERSON> pope </PERSON> nearly 10 years ago.

 <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> heiress who has authored books on astrology, said Sunday she is the `` friend'' who advised first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on matters such as safe times for the president to travel. `` I ca n't deny that she has consulted me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> Nob </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> home. `` I am very uncomfortable, however, with the situation because normally I never discuss the identity of my clients, and I never discuss their affairs.'' `` I am a serious, scientific astrologer and I am really not one of these clowns, and I really do n't like this circus atmosphere,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and has written three books on the subject. Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>'s revelation followed reports on the book, `` For the Record; From Wall Street to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' in which <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> writes that `` virtually every major move and decision the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a woman in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the enterprise.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> confessed that he never learned the identity of the woman, whom he said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> referred to only as `` my friend in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' Time magazine, which published excerpts from the book, first identified the woman. Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who frequently appears on the <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> television show, said she was first introduced to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. `` I really did n't get actively involved until the first campaign'' for president by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, she told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. She said she did astrological work for the campaign, but declined to give details. `` After the assassination attempt, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked me if she could consult me because she was worried about the president's safety, as well she might be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said She said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned her at `` various times,'' sometimes on Saturday afternoons from Camp David, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> reported. `` I certainly never controlled the president's actions,'' she said. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would want to know if something was a safe time and I certainly advised her on that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said her advice is based on the exact time and place of a person's birth. In a separate interview with Time, she said, `` An astrologer just picks the best possible time to do something that someone else has already planned to do. It is like being in the ocean. You should go with the waves, not against them.''

 An earthquake hit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost main island of Hokkaido Monday morning. Police said they had no reports of damage or casualties. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the quake registered 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and struck at 7:44 a.m. _ 6:44 p.m. Sunday EDT. It said the quake was centered in Hokkaido's <PERSON> Hidaka </PERSON> mountain range. Monday's tremor followed a strong earthquake that measured 6.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> and rocked Hokkaido Saturday. In that quake, which was centered off the coast of the island, local trains were temporarily halted while tracks were inspected but there was no serious damage. There have been two major earthquakes in Hokkaido in the past 35 years. A quake in 1968 killed 52 people. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake registering 5 can cause considerable damage and one of six is capable of causing severe damage. A reading of 7 indicates a major quake. Each increase of one number represents a tenfold increase in magnitude.

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delivered a fresh attack on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Sunday, saying the vice president has `` started to panic.'' Last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a `` hustler from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been excoriating the apparent Republican nominee ever since. `` Now as we get closer, the opposition hears our footprints and begins to panic,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has begun to panic and has begun to call me names. ... He's panicking with indecision. He's panicking with selective memory.'' `` Why would anyone resort to name-calling?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` A combination of constipation of the brain, deafness of ideas and diarrhea of the mouth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the `` hustler'' remark on Friday as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. His campaign staff said there was `` nothing derogatory'' intended in the remark. Spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> later said it was meant as a comment on how hard <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has worked. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not mollified. `` He's trapped in an unholy triangle between the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' he said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, referring to <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s comments came as he was here delivering a graduation address for his alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> graduated from the college in 1964. Campaigning later Sunday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which holds its primary on Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reacted strongly to reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been briefed three years ago about drug trafficking by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The reason Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not led the charge to fight drugs is because he knew of the administration's dealings with the drug dealers,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s Tri-State Airport. `` We must be leaders in an aggressive drive to stop drugs in our country.'' <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, on Sunday denied a report in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that said that while he was ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> he had briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1985 on evidence of drug trafficking by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I could not have briefed the vice president on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug running, drug smuggling or money laundering activities because we simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time,'' <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had any campaign appearances on Sunday. `` Can I compete with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` That's <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> They have the prestige, they have the power structure, they have the press, they have the pundits ... and yet I must not surrender. I've always battled the odds and won. I'm a survivor.'' A number of his family members were in the audience, including his wife <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> and his two sons, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, both of whom were awarded degrees during the ceremony. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reflected on his years at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and on the years since his graduation, recalling his activism as a participant in civil rights sit-ins to demand desegregation of public facilities in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>. He urged the 900 graduating students in the Greensboro Coliseum not to allow difficult circumstances to stifle their dreams. `` As I get closer to the White House, there are no more impossible dreams,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his showing has been strong despite being out-funded by his Democratic rival. `` I've come from further back with fewer resources, running strong and do n't feel no ways tired,'' he said. `` Now just do n't say ` Run, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Run </PERSON>.' I run that you might run. If I run for president, surely you can run for governor. If I run for president, surely you can run for senator.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, sounding a familiar theme, said many young blacks might see him campaigning on television and suspect that he can not understand their difficulties. `` I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me,'' he said, invoking his early years. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mother was an unmarried teen-ager when she gave birth to him. `` Born in three-room house, parents who did n't have health insurance. I understand. Bathroom on the back porch, slop jar by the bed. I understand. `` Had to hang out clothes on nails. I understand. Wallpaper used for windbreaker, not for decoration. I understand. Had stand by an open stove to get heat. I really do understand. `` Against those odds ... I never earned the right to do less than my best and you do not have the right than to do less than your best,'' he told the students.

 Americans celebrated Mother's Day with millions of phone calls home, peace rallies in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, free meals for the needy in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and special treatment for mothers of newborns. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> predicted about 46 million calls would be placed Sunday, topping the old mark of 44 million calls placed Christmas Day 1987. Actual calling figures were not available late Sunday. About 750 people participated in a Mother's Day protest at the nation's nuclear testing grounds in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and 323 people, including actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, were arrested on trespassing charges, authorities said. While many families shared Mother's Day privately, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, over 100 mothers from the impoverished Tenderloin neighborhood dined at a Fisherman's Wharf restaurant while fathers and other men from the community took care of their estimated 300 children. In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, many of the 1,000 people at the Mother's Day March for Peace and Justice used the eighth annual event to show concern for the future of their children. `` We've got a world here to pass along to our children, and we'd like to impress upon people that it would be nice to have a world that's safe for children,'' Dr. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, said during Saturday's march `` I think part of being a responsible parent is taking responsibility for creating a world of peace and justice,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Benrud </PERSON>, a 26-year-old mother of three. A group with the same goals, the Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament, used a Mother's Day Ball gathering in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to honor astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> and his wife, author <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Druyan </PERSON>, for their efforts to reverse the nuclear arms race. Hospitals got into the Mother's Day spirit in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Hospital of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> hired limousines to take new mothers home, while babies at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> were `` gift-wrapped'' with flowers and pink or blue ribbons before being brought to their mothers.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was re-elected Sunday to a second seven-year term in a resounding victory over conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. The Socialist president pledged to fight the anguish, difficulty and uncertainty facing many French people. `` You have chosen to accord me your confidence,'' said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71. `` There is too much anguish, too much difficulty and too much uncertainty for too many in our society for us to forget that our first duty is national solidarity,'' he said. `` Because the life of humanity depends on it, I will act passionately in your name for the development of poor nations, for disarmament and peace.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> supporters drove along the main Champs-Elysees Avenue cheering and honking horns. `` In a democracy, the public is the master and I bow before its choice,'' the premier said. `` I wish good luck to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and good luck to the French.'' Vote counting was suspended early Monday with 98.1 percent of the ballots tabulated. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had 53.91 percent and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> 46.09 percent. The turnout was 84.5 percent, less than the 85.9 percent in the 1981 presidential election. More than 38 million people were eligle to vote. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was expected to submit the resignation of his government in the coming days. His center-right coalition continues to control the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has said the new premier he will name will try to work with the present Parliament. Failing that, he will be forced to dissolve the Assembly and call new elections. The state-run Antenne 2 TV network projected <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would receive 53.9 percent of the vote _ the most since <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Pompidou </PERSON> won 58.2 percent in the 1969 runoff. In the first round of elections on April 24, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won 34.1 percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was second with 19.9 percent. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, leader of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> who won an astonishing 14.4 percent of the vote in the first round, said in a bitter statement that the traditional right was `` the stupidest right in the world.'' He blamed <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> for scorning the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and said that was responsible for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s victory. `` Today, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is back in the dead end it could have escaped,'' he said. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, a centrist who supported <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s re-election was a defeat for the government's center-right policies. `` The president is going to name a new government,'' <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> said. `` We will judge it by its acts. One should not decide in advance to vote against it. I will vote for the laws that I find good and I will vote against the laws that I find bad.'' The campaign ended on a dramatic note, with the <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> government winning the release of French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. Election day was not without its problems. In central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a group of masked men wielding steel bars charged into a right-wing rally celebrating <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc day. Seven people were injured, five seriously. No group claimed responsibility. In the tiny Alpine village of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eusebe-en-Champsaur </LOCATION>, the local <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> called for a boycott of the election to protest the planned closure of the village school next fall. The school has only 12 pupils, but the <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION> says there have been a large number of births in the past three years that will increase future classes. Two weeks ago, only 16 of the village's 135 registered voters cast their ballots in the first round. The election marked the first time in the 30-year history of the Fifth Republic that an incumbent chief executive and his premier faced one another for the presidency. Political debate throughout the long campaign focused largely on generalities with few concrete proposals made by either candidate. During the last week of the campaign, three French hostages were released in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and French gendarmes freed a group of hostages taken by separatists in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said Saturday the incidents were not timed to coincide with the election, the events became an important element in the last hours of the campaign. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has said he `` contributed'' to the release of the hostages. `` There is no distinction between the government and me in such a sensitive matter,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has moved markedly toward the center of the political spectrum since he came to power in a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> landslide seven years ago, issued a long `` Letter to all the French.'' As opposed to 1981, when he campaigned on 110 specific proposals, his 1988 platform was vague, built around a `` rallying'' of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people for a `` united <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' and social justice. Most of his ideas are aimed at getting <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> ready for 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> drops all remaining trade barriers and creates a true Common Market. Among his few specific proposals, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he will stop the cycle of nationalization and privatization of French companies, re-establish the wealth tax abolished by the right when it came to power in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and create a minumum guaranteed income. His top priority will emphasize training and research as the key to fighting <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 10.4 percent unemployment. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s platform, titled `` The Decade of Renewal,'' had three basic themes: family, business and training. He pledged to continue the policies begun in 1986 when the conservatives and centrists ousted the Socialists from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The premier's platform, which also focuses on modernizing the French economy before 1992, is short on figures, but calls for continuing to reduce taxes on business and individuals, a three-year budget deficit reduction program, further denationalizations and an end to new immigration. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s current term ends at midnight May 20.

<HEAD>Finger-Pointing Over Bank Lending Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reports that many of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s banks restrict home loans in black neighborhoods have generated strong protests from political leaders despite bankers' denials. In a series of reports last week, The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution said a study showed that white neighborhoods received five times as much money in home loans in 1986 as black neighborhoods with the same income level. The newspapers suggested that race helped determine lending patterns, an illegal practice known as red-lining. `` I want to hear from some of our banking friends and people at the savings and loans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, who is black. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> formed a committee of bankers, politicians and citizens to investigate lending practices and make recommendations in 20 days. State banking commissioner <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> needs a law requiring banks to reinvest deposits in their communities. The <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved a law prohibiting discrimination in the sale, rental or finance of housing. `` I feel that the banks really do owe not only affirmative action in regard to this, but an apology to the city as a whole, whether they've known about it or not,'' said commission Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who is black. `` And I think they owe us an apology for some of the characterizations they've made of the black community.'' The newspapers said federal statistics showed that loans to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s middle-income black neighborhoods averaged $ 339.27 per single-family home in 1986, compared with $ 2,432.82 in middle-income white neighborhoods. The newspapers also said banks closed branches or restricted business hours and gave lower property assessments in mostly black neighborhoods. They said the banking practices hindered economic development in the city's mostly black south side. Officials of several financial institutions that attended a special <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week denied that anything other than economics determines their lending. They did not dispute the newspapers' figures, though, and offered few suggestions for boosting loans in black areas. `` It's called the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rule </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan. `` Do n't lend money if you wo n't get it back.'' `` Much of the housing in predominately black areas is substandard, requiring rehabilitation to qualify for mortgage lending,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` As a result, this can not be handled through conventional mortgage lending channels.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a black-owned institution, disagreed. `` I have difficulty believing that most of the housing in black neighborhoods is substandard,'' he said. `` That is where the black community of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> really got its name nationally. People who come from outside are amazed: ` Black folks got these kinds of houses here?''' Citizens Trust, which lends mostly to blacks, had a lower default rate on real estate loans than the six largest banks in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and the lowest of any bank its size in the nation in 1986, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency that reports for bank examiners. Some people suggested blacks should withdraw deposits from banks that wo n't do business with them. `` If lending policies and practices do not change substantially to meet the concerns and demands of the black consumer market, then withdrawing funds from the recalcitrant banks and banks with poor policies would be a logical step to take,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinhoster </PERSON>, Southeastern regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People.

 A tentative deal in which striking shipworkers would get more pay but not press for reinstatement of Solidarity took shape in talks revived at the urging of the country's interior minister, strike leaders said. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who also is a ranking Communist Party Politburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to revive the talks after they broke down late in the afternoon, strike committee members said. The conversations between <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sila-Nowicki </PERSON>, a former member of the outlawed Solidarity trade union who has since agreed to serve on Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s consultative citizens' council, led to the resumption Sunday night, they said. The talks resumed at 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB-, three hours after Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and about 1,000 other workers defied a management ultimatum to leave the shipyard or face prosecution. As a result of the talks, the strike committee wrote a letter to management in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its long-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the following conditions: _ Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and the people who have assisted them _ Promises of no disciplinary action against strikers, including fines, dismissals or prosecutions. And formation of a joint committee from members of the strike committee and the shipyard workers' council to oversee implementation of the agreement. _ A wage increase of $ 38 on the average monthly wage of the last three months, about $ 105. According to strike committee chairman <PERSON> Alojzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szablewski </PERSON> and other committee members, an agreement was near. The remaining sticking points were the creation of the joint committee, objected to by management, and whether the rank and file strikers were willing to give up demands for Solidarity, they said. It was not known whether the two sides planned to push for an agreement through the night, or try again Monday. The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1 ,000 reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reporters there Sunday Although a settlement appeared within reach, strikers inside said they still feared a police action against the strike. Thousands of worshipers packed a church in this Baltic port city in a show of support for the strikers. In <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> spoke out for the right of all people to participate in society's decisions All was quiet at the shipyard late Sunday after the deadline in the management ultimum passed at 6 p.m. -LRB- noon EDT -RRB-. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said the negotiations Sunday afternoon lasted only one hour and management's hard line stood in sharp contrast to talks Saturday that the union considered `` a big step forward.'' `` The prosecutor and manager listed an ultimatum, saying all who leave before six are safe and will not be prosecuted,'' <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON> said, speaking to reporters at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s Church near the shipyard. The Lenin shipyard strike began Monday and came during a period of labor upheaval that has been the worst in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the 1981 military crackdown. The strikers have also demanded higher pay, anmesty for the workers occupying the shipyard and the reinstatement of union activists fired by the plant. Riot police blockaded the shipyard on Thursday and have not allowed any food in since Friday. A predawn raid by riot police crushed a 10-day strike by steelworkers in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Thursday, and some shipyard workers said they feared a similar action. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said in his sermon that the church can `` point out the road toward specific solutions. But it is necessary to remember that every man has the right to participate in decisions concernings the society in which he lives.'' His sermon followed a statement Saturday by Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> that strikes can be justified and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> lacked `` true democracy.'' About 5,000 strike supporters crammed inside <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brygida </LOCATION>'s Church to pray for those in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, the 1980 birthplace of Solidarity About 2,000 more flooded the streets nearby and thousands of police stood guard around the church. `` Disgrace Disgrace'' the crowd chanted when the Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s friend and adviser, delivered his sermon. `` Why should we support the striking workers?'' <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> asked the crowd rhetorically. `` Because they are fighting for our rights. ... The shipyard is the symbol of all of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' His speech was interrupted with chants of `` <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>! <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>!'' and `` There is no freedom without Solidarity!'' On Saturday night <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the strikers that if a raid came, `` I'll be the last to leave the shipyard.'' The shipyard strike was the latest of five strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. In each case, workers have pressed for higher wages to counteract inflation which reached 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. The government has said the strikes could derail <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s attempts to reform its ailing economy by raising prices, reducing goverment subsidies, introducing competition and encouraging private and managerial enterprise One of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s closest advisers, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornicki </PERSON>, said Sunday that the strikes were a normal outgrowth of `` making our economy more efficient. `` This always, and everywhere, brings about some tribulations,'' he said, interviewed from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.''

 More than 1,000 supporters gathered at the hillside estate of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Sunday for a three-hour memorial service for the exiled <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> president's mother. `` A <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> that is free, democratic and strong, that is the legacy of my mother,'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said in the eulogy. `` I shall not see her dead.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> won Sunday's presidential election in the runoff race between two leftists to succeed pro-American President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>. `` Thank you, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, thank you,'' <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> said on television in the capital. `` We will have a government by the people and for the people.'' Thousands of <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s supporters in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, his highland stronghold, swarmed into the streets to celebrate and caravans of cars with their horns blaring packed the city's avenues. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s rival, <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, conceded defeat in an address over national television from his power base in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>. `` There are no excuses. Dr. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> is the president of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> said. With the count nearly complete, <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> had 1,584,483 of the valid votes and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> 1,344,200. Political analysts had said the election was too close to call. Public opinion polls showed 25 percent of the country's 4.7 million eligible voters still undecided in the final weeks of the campaign. Election oficials had estimated the voter turnout would be about 80 percent. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> had conducted a bitter campaign marked by exchanges of insults in their race to replace <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a conservative who has promoted free-market policies and befriended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> voted in <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> and discounted persistent rumors of a military coup if <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> is elected. Coups `` are out of fashion,'' he said. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> has charged that the right spread the rumors to try to prevent him from winning.

 The election pitted <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a 52-year-old law professor and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, against <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, a tough-talking 36-year-old populist who vowed to `` punish the oligarchy.'' Sirens and church bells echoed Sunday through the streets of this city 9,300 feet high in the Andes, signaling opening of polls. Voters included colorfully dressed Highland Indians from the outskirts of the capital. Indians make up 35 percent of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s population of 10 million Campaign violence intensified in the final weeks before the election, leaving three people dead and more than a dozen wounded. Newspapers and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders blamed the clashes on the vitriolic rhetoric of the candidates. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Roldosista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called his adversary a drunkard, a drug addict and an atheist, a potentially damaging accusation in this heavily Catholic nation. He also used coarse street language to question <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>'s manliness. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, an urbane, usually reserved politician from <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, responded with insults of his own, calling <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> a `` fascist ignoramus.'' <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> qualified for the runoff by leading a field of 10 candidates in the first round of voting Jan. 31. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> won 20 percent of the vote, and <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> took 15. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, came in third, a sign of his government's low popularity. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, who lost a close runoff to the president in 1984 and was making his third bid for the presidency, pledged to reverse the government's free-market economic policies and seek close ties to the non-aligned movement. <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON> is political boss of the huge slums that sprawl over the outskirts of <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION>, the country's largest city and its major port. His opponents accused him of making demagogic appeals to the poor, including promises to give free shoes to all poor children and nearly double the monthly minimum wage to $ 55. His followers affectionally call him `` the crazy one'' because of his fiery speaking style. During the campaign, he recorded a song titled `` That's Why They Call Me Crazy.'' This small nation returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, whose four-year term ends in August, has had a stormy relationship with leftist and populist parties that controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He also put down a rebellion by an air force commander halfway through his presidency. His successor faces the most serious national economic crisis since <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> began exporting oil in the early 1970s. The economy shrank in 1987 by 3.5 percent, and inflation is expected to climb to at least 50 percent this year, the highest level since 1983. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s supporters blame the problems on a sharp drop in the price of oil, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s main source of income, and economic damage from a devastating earthquake in March 1987.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' private plane landed at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base on Sunday after <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents harassed his own security detail waiting for him at a commercial airport, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was returning with family members from <LOCATION> Contadora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> when the plane landed at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in the capital, said embassy spokesman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>. As the small jet landed, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> saw several <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents armed with rifles `` harassing'' the ambassador's security detail, <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> then decided to have the plane take off and land instead at <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, five miles to the northwest in the canal zone. One of the Panamanian security agents at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was demanding to know who was on the plane with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security officials were in contact with the plane by radio as it came in to land, the <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON> said, and spoke with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> once on the ground. It was then decided in the face of `` fairly hostile actions'' on the part of the Panamanian agents to fly the plane elsewhere, he added. The plane then radioed for and received takeoff clearance from the airport tower before flying on to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` The ambassador never got out of his plane,'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' daughter and other family members were aboard the aircraft. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security detail left <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' plane took off, the official said. There was no immediate comment from Panamanian governent officials. Paitilla Airport services small private and commercial aircraft. It was the second incident in which <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security agents apparently sought to interfere with the ambassador's movements in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On April 3, a military vehicle tried to stop <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' chauffer-driven limousine as he was leaving the residence of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ambassador The vehicle followed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' limousine and tried to stop it with lights and sirens, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials said at the time. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> continued on to his own residence in what the Embassy called a `` serious'' incident. The Panamanian government said the episode involving the ambassador's limousine was `` strictly a police matter'' caused when a police sergeant saw `` an exaggerated display of automatic arms carried by civilians in three vehicles'' that followed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' vehicle Sunday's incident at <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was certain to further strain relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> government dominated by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the Defense Forces. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges and has rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that he resign.

 A new <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law that will ban plastic foam packaging made with ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons is n't creating much of a stir in the packaging industry, but the law's backers say its symbolic impact is By enacting restrictions against foam packaging produced with the compound, known as CFCs, the state has created a vehicle for possible future restrictions on other products made with CFCs, lawmakers and industry watchers say. `` It will send a very strong message to industries who use CFCs that they have to clean up their act,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, who helped shepherd the law through the legislature. CFC-produced foam containers used for packaging fast food and other products may not be sold or made in the state beginning in 1990. The plastic foam packaging industry is n't worried, partly because it does not have a manufacturing presence in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Furthermore, manufacturers already have agreed to use a substitute chemical compound that is less damaging to the ozone layer than are CFCs. `` I do n't foresee it as a problem for anyone in the industry,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lammers </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, the nation's leading producer of foam cups and containers. But even though the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law is regarded as a marshmallow, its chief authors and environmental experts say it its symbolic effect and future implications are important. `` It's like the seat belt law with no fine,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON>, who along with <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> herded the bill through the legislature. `` It's a warning to people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> packaging ban breezed through the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> legislature this year and was signed by Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was the only other state with a similar law. Gaseous CFCs are used to expand polystyrene beads into the foamy plastic containers that some fast-food chains are using to package hamburgers. Egg cartons, cups, and cafeteria trays also commonly use the product, <PERSON> Lammers </PERSON> said. The chemical compound escapes to the atmosphere during production, slowly rising 15 to 25 miles to deplete the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the Sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. Some CFCs are trapped in the foam products and released later. The <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> stated last month that the industry would be operating with a less-damaging substitute chemical by 1989. The substitute, known as HCFC-22, was approved last December by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and three major environmental groups support its use until a completely safe substitute is found. HCFC-22 still has some potential for damaging the ozone layer, but the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimates it is only about 5 percent as powerful as CFCs. CFC use in making food packaging foams account for only 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' total <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use. But <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, a professor of public affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Humphrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law would have an impact because `` it's an indication of the state's concern.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> law on the books could be strengthened later to cover other sources of CFCs, which also are used in refrigeration units and construction materials. `` Next year I'm sure we'll come back and look at this issue some more,'' <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said he would like to pass legislation next year requiring warning labels on other products that contain or are manufactured with CFCs. Under the new law, state and local governments will be banned beginning January 1 from purchasing, manufacturing, selling or distributing packaging known to be CFC-processed. The ban will be extended to cover all citizens beginning Jan. 1, 1990. Violators could be fined up to $ 500. The law passed by the 1988 Legislature also appropriates $ 25,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to study ways to eliminate other <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> sources in the state.

 The action has been unusually lively of late for the 900,000-plus investors who own shares of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In the stock market debacle last fall, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> shares lost some 47 percent of their value, plummeting from a high of 94 to a low of 50. In the few months since then, they have recovered more than half that loss, rallying past 75. Of course, many stocks have experienced wide swings in the past year. But the behavior of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has been noteworthy for several reasons. Given its standing as the nation's second most widely owned stock, outranked only by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, the ups and downs of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s price have had a far-reaching impact on the finances and emotions of the investing public. What's more, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has long been regarded as a quintessential blue chip, a relatively stable investment supported by a generous dividend yield -LRB- 6.6 percent as of late last week -RRB-. Through the mid-1980s, it lived up to that billing. From early 1983 through early 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> swung back and forth in a range roughly between 60 and 85. It was only when the long bull market reached its climax last year that the stock jumped to a new high and subsequently toppled to a five-year low. Certainly, some of that increased volatility can be attributed to the flighty environment for stocks in general. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> holds a prominent place in the market indexes used by professionals in computer-program trading. But as any casual reader of the business news would readily conclude, there has been more to the story than that. As a giant enterprise plagued by mounting competition from both foreign automakers and its domestic counterparts, the company has come under increased criticism in recent years about its management decisions and ways of doing business. The negative reviews perhaps reached a crescendo in mid-February, when Fortune magazine described 1988 as `` the make-or-break year for the world's biggest company'' and carried a cover story in which erstwhile board member <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> described `` How I would turn around GM.'' At the same time, however, many Wall Street analysts who follow the auto industry were taking a different view _ that the company was beginning to sort out its problems, cut its costs and improve its earnings prospects. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, declares, `` The turnaround at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> continues. `` On the product side, momentum has shifted. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s products, both cars and trucks, are selling better than last year. `` Internal audits show that quality is up significantly and, by most accounts, style in design is improving too. We continue to believe <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> represents an excellent investment opportunity.'' Not all the company's followers on the Street are quite so sanguine. Said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in a recent report: `` The major problem, as we see it, is not the company's short-term potential of profitability, but whether <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is capable of building and selling cars that will be competitive with the next generation of Japanese and European vehicles `` The company is still extremely vulnerable to negative news, and hence our reluctance to jump on the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> bandwagon.'' Wherever it is headed in the future, the recent strength in the price of the stock is heartening to followers of the `` GM bellwether'' as an indicator of the overall market outlook. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, president of the money-management firm <ORGANIZATION> Stovall-Twenty-First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, says this indicator has been bullish since <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> shares went four months without matching or going below their Oct. 19 low of 50. <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON> concedes the patterns in <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock chart are n't an infallible guide to the market outlook. The `` bellwether'' got caught in the midst of the flock in the crash last fall. Nevertheless, he says, `` it is now heralding a summer rally.''

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON> mopped his face with a towel as he walked away from an exhausting session that had nothing to do with making cars at the local <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant. <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON> headed for the shower while other <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> employees continued grunting through repetitions on weight machines, pedaled away on manual exercise bikes and worked on balance and agility on a simulated cross-country ski unit in one corner of the Flat Rock plant's fitness center. `` Job One'' _ the first <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> car made at Flat Rock _ rolled off the assembly line in September. In November, the company opened the $ 1 million fitness center in a 90,000-square-foot section of one of the plant buildings. Fitness programs, once the reserve of management, are moving from the front office to the plant floor at many companies, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> region vice president for Fitness Systems. `` That's where we see the direction of this thing going.'' `` It's been an administrative headquarters, white-collar kind of phenomenon,'' said <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>, whose Los Angeles-based company designs, sets up and operates fitness programs. Now, he said, `` We do see more plant sites getting involved.'' Reasons range from simple economics _ an unhealthy worker costs more to keep on the job _ to companies' desire to be involved with employees as a way of keeping them involved in their work. At Flat Rock, the matter was never in question, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON>, personnel safety and health director. Japanese corporations routinely provide extras for improving the health and lifestyle of their employees. Single workers may even live in company dormitories there. `` It was always pretty much taken for granted that we were going to do something in terms of a fitness center,'' <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, it's something they do.'' A study conducted last year on the <ORGANIZATION> StayWell </ORGANIZATION> program <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> implemented for its employees linked higher health insurance claims with various risk factors, including lack of exercise, smoking, excess weight and high cholesterol. For example, sedentary employees have 30 percent more hospital days than those who get adequate exercise and employees who smoke a pack or more of cigarettes a day have 18 percent higher medical claims costs than nonsmokers. `` There are some very solid, practical business reasons for wanting to do this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON> said. `` Fit, happy workers produce more. They are less likely to be absent, they are less likely to be injured.'' Before and after work at Flat Rock, as early as 5:30 a.m. and as late as 9 p.m., the sounds of weight machines, dribbling basketballs and squeaking sneakers, footfalls on the one-fifth mile track, volleys on the tennis courts, golf balls driven into a net, ping-pong games, and players' shouts echo under the high plant ceiling. `` Some nights I call over here and it's so loud you ca n't even talk on the phone,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemon </PERSON>, plant medical services coordinator and fitness center director. Domestic companies get the message. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plants offer a scattering of exercise rooms and aerobics classes. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is surveying some assembly plant workers to see if they want aerobics classes. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, offers a `` healthy lifestyle'' program for employees that includes newsletters and reimbursement for participation in fitness activities, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, company communications manager. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> opened a fitness center at its corporate headquarters in 1986 and followed in January with a center at its <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> cereal plant, where the exercise bikes, rowing machines, weight-lifting equipment, jogging track and aerobics room are in such demand among the 3,200 employees that hours have been extended to midnight, <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> said. At Flat Rock, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s center is part of an involvement with employees similar to that in its Japanese plants. The number of Japanese employees at <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> _ 600 of the plant's 3,500 _ eventually will fall to about 100. But the company wants <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employees to be instilled with Japanese-style team spirit. `` We were not so much interested in building a recreation center for employees. It's great if they want to use it for that. But we wanted to emphasize the team concept,'' <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON> said. `` We were interested in building a facility that would cater to team activity.'' Team activity caught on immediately. <PERSON> Nemon </PERSON> said intensely involved employees formed committees for baseball, volleyball, weight training, running, martial arts, aerobics and golf. `` All the committees have established classes and leagues,'' she said. `` The employees themselves completely run those activities. They have 20 different teams in the basketball league.'' `` I worked at Jeep before. They never had anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON>, just out of training as an assembly worker at <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. He compared the center favorably with outside programs, explaining that he and his wife had spent $ 400 at the Y, which did n't have a place to run. `` I ca n't wait till they get that heavy bag up,'' he said. <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON> said he envisions annual physicals for employees, with prescriptions for good health habits _ quitting smoking, weight control, cholesterol reduction and hypertension control. Center activities already go far beyond traditional gymnasium fare, <PERSON> Nemon </PERSON> said, including a diet support group and available literature on subjects ranging from smoking to personal relationships. <PERSON> Kricho </PERSON> said Japanese companies view corporate responsibility as going beyond a paycheck. And he said, `` If we are responsible for human beings _ spiritual and mental well being and everything else _ a fitness center becomes a very central ingredient, a focal point.''

 These are heady days for light beer. While overall growth in the beer business has flattened out, light beer sales remain effervescent. They have nearly doubled in the past seven years and now account for more than 24 percent of the overall beer market. The major brewers are encouraging the growth by spending nearly $ 220 million a year on advertising light beers, about a third of their total ad budgets, according to Leading National Advertisers, which tracks such spending. In the latest indication of the importance brewers attach to the segment, <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> recently began testing a light version of its Genuine Draft beer, which has been on the market for about two years. Industry executives and analysts say the nation's weight - and health-consciousness continues to propel the segment's growth `` You can drink the same amount of beer and take in less calories. What more can one ask out of life?'' said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who follows the beer industry for <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The light beers typically have a third fewer calories than the 140-150 calories in regular beers and slightly less alcohol. Beverage industry analysts say another important ingredient in the success of light beers has been the ability of brewers to make and market a drink that traditional beer drinkers are n't ashamed to order. In the 1960s, industry watchers said light beers had been pitched mainly as diet drinks for women. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellas </PERSON>, president of the research firm <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the country was n't ready for a low-calorie approach then. Pitching the drink to women may also have alienated some men, which is something brewers normally try to avoid since men reportedly consume about 80 percent of all the beer sold. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a brewing industry consultant and professor of marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said another flaw in the light beers of the 1960s was taste. `` They were horrible, and usually died a fast death. They did n't taste like beer and were poorly marketed,'' he said Milwaukee-based <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> began to turn that around in 1973 when it started testing a new light beer under the Lite name it bought from another brewer. `` Everything you always wanted in a beer ... and less,'' was the original theme. The brewer used former athletes and celebrities to sell its beer, an approach that it continues to use 15 years later. The approach infuriated critics who said it encouraged young people to drink, but it helped <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> convince customers that it was acceptable for tough guys to drink light beer. Others brewers were skeptical about <PERSON> Lite </PERSON>'s chances and stayed out of that end of the market for a few years. `` It was the only significant consumer packaged good industry where a company could bring out imaginative new products and not have competitors follow suit immediately,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. By the time others woke up, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had a grip on the market that it has been slow to yield. `` We will never enjoy that kind of competitive advantage again,'' admitted <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertini </PERSON>. Beverage Marketing said 45.1 million barrels of light beer were sold last year, up 7.1 percent from the previous year, while sales of all kinds of beer slipped 0.2 percent to 187.2 million barrels. There are about 70 light brands. Sales of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> were flat at about 19.3 million barrels, but it is the second-best selling beer overall -LRB- Budweiser is No. 1 at about 50 million barrels -RRB- and holds a 2-to-1 lead in share of the light beer segment. Its main competition comes from Bud Light from <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, which sold an estimated 8.6 million barrels last year, and from <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, which sold 7.9 million barrels. Beverage Marketing estimates Lite held 42.8 percent of the light segment in 1987 compared with 19.1 percent for Bud Light and 17.5 percent for Coors Light. Bud Light has grown at a furious pace since its introduction in 1982, scoring well in consumer surveys with ads that show quirky responses to customers who ask for a `` light'' without specifying the brand and with commercials featuring party animal Spuds MacKenzie. Coors Light, introduced in 1977, has been advertised as the silver bullet that `` wo n't slow you down'' and `` the right beer now.'' Last year, its sales surpassed those of Coors premium beer for the first time. Other leading light beers include Michelob Light at 5.8 percent of the market and Natural Light at 5.1 percent from <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> has captured about 6.2 percent of the market with two brands, <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> and Stroh Light. Light beer accounted for 24.1 percent of overall beer sales in 1987, up from 13.1 percent in 1980. Can its share growth continue? <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said the increasing incidence of brewers attaching their regular brands' names to light beers show brewers are taking the segment seriously even if they are doing so partly just to get more shelf space. Others say as the median age of the population moves higher, even more people will find themselves worrying about their weight. `` Thirty percent of the market does n't seem to be unattainable,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, executive editor of the industry newsletter Beer Marketers Insights. `` But can it get to 40 percent, I just do n't know.''
