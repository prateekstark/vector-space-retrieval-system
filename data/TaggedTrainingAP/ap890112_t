 A Salvadoran accused of conspiring in the 1980 assassination of Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was freed on bail Thursday night after his homeland's high court denied a request for his extradition, his attorney said. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> had been ordered held by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government, which accused him of arranging <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s assassination on orders of right-wing legislator <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who denied the allegation `` <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> telephoned one of my associates at 8:30 tonight and told him ` I'm out,''' said his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> was released on $ 10,000 bond pending deportation hearings, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last month there was n't enough evidence linking <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> to the murder, and said he would not be subject to arrest if he were sent home. <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>, a former captain in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s air force, had been jailed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since November 1987, when he was arrested for a traffic violation and authorities found he had been in the country illegally since 1985. The Salvadoran government withdrew its extradition request after its courts ruled that there were no grounds for arresting him on charges he had violated his visa, and that the extradition request itself was illegal. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of right-wing death squads, was shot by a sniper while saying Mass in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on March 24, 1980. In November 1987, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government accused <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> of arranging the assassination and released the testimony of <PERSON> Amadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garay </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who allegedly drove the sniper to the church. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Garay </PERSON>'s testimony was not credible, partly because he waited more than seven years to come forward with his story. The court also said Attorney General <PERSON> Giron </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did not have the constitutional power to ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to send <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> had directly asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>'s extradition The case went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>'s attorney requested a hearing <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, who is also representing Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> against federal drug charges here, said <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> had gone home to his wife, who has been living in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Prisons Don't Want Cancer Victim Jailed in Sewer Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wilburt </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, the 73-year-old cancer victim jailed in a dispute over a sewer hook-up, was freed Thursday after a state prison and a county jail both refused to accept him as a prisoner. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> spent Wednesday night in the <ORGANIZATION> Lieber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ridgeville </LOCATION>. But he was released after state officials decided they lacked authority to imprison an inmate for civil contempt of court. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was then sent back to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but Sheriff <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said the county jail could n't house him because it is overcrowded. He also said the jail did n't have the medical facilities to treat <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who suffers from rectal cancer. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Gedney </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> then asked for a hearing before Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, who found <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> in contempt last November. `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and I came to the same conclusion if he could n't go to <PERSON> Lieber </PERSON>, he sure could n't go to the county jail,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. Before the hearing, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said he and the judge discussed options in the case and said <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said a motion to appeal the contempt order could be considered. `` I appealed the judge's opinion which will postpone him -LRB- <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> -RRB- going back to jail,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. He said appeals to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can take some time and `` hopefully he'll be a free man for at least several months.'' `` Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> today looked at a difficult problem and found a way out that was satisfactory to everybody and was legally correct,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` We're so weary and thankful and we're just going to go to bed,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> said later from the couple's home. `` It's been a rough day.'' The contempt order stems from <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION>' refusal to obey an earlier 1986 court order that he connect his <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> home to a sewer line. The <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> have had a decade-long dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> over connecting the sewer. They say the tap-in point is too far from their septic tank and would cost them an additional $ 2,000 and cause them to destroy several large pine trees in order to make the connection. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said the issue arose as to whether <PERSON> Lieber </PERSON> should house the prisoner after <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> arrived at the prison Wednesday. `` They referred it to the department's legal advisor in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> who researched the matter and he said we lacked the authority'' to house a prisoner jailed for civil contempt, <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> said. He said the decision was based on an attorney general's opinion of some years back. The <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> case was later the topic of a discussion between Corrections Department legal advisor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> and state Attorney General <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Medlock </PERSON> concurred in the decision, <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> escorted <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> from the modest <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> house, which was draped with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and where yellow ribbons were tied around five large pine trees. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said he was going to prison for his principles and that he had been treated unfairly compared to other residents in the area who had sewer lines closer to their homes or had not been forced to hook onto the sewer.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is home to wealthy cotton plantations, stately antebellum mansions and a growing share of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toxic wastes. Now, with a 10-year-old waste landfill's license up for renewal, a debate is looming over the state's role as the nation's `` septic tank.'' `` We have been taken advantage of,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallman </PERSON>, who resigned in November as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> to take a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. He's pushing legislation that would tighten state control of waste disposal. The <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> landfill in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is one of two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast _ the other is in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ and is the tomb for a half-million tons of chemicals. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is also home to two hazardous-waste incinerators and one for infectious waste; the Barnwell low-level nuclear waste landfill, and the troubled <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> that produces nuclear bomb fuel. `` It all plays in. The reason GSX has become an issue is not because it is the only issue, but because it's a symbolic issue,'' said Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON>, a long-time critic of the landfill. Some 130,000 tons of chemical garbage will be buried at GSX this year, about 70 percent from industries in more than 30 other states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Two incinerators, in <LOCATION> Roebuck </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, can accept a total of 58,920 tons a year of hazardous waste; 75 percent is from other states. A third can take 36,500 tons of infectious waste, which comes from 10 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chem-Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> low-level radioactive waste landfill at <LOCATION> Barnwell </LOCATION> _ the only one in operation in the nation _ took 900,000 cubic feet of contaminated clothing, tools and other debris in 1988 and expects the same this year. The state produces 85,000 tons of hazardous waste a year, according to the health department. It has plenty of room for its neighbors' garbage. `` It seems we're a patsy for somebody, does n't it? It seems that the federal government has found a place that does n't resist,'' said <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, a retired hotel manager and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major. `` It just seems that we're getting more than our share. `` I feel that at some point in time, that place will be a real problem to us, and that we should n't be required to take other states' waste.'' The 279-acre GSX landfill opened in 1978. Its bottom rests 10 feet above an aquifer and its lip is 400 yards from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, one of the <PERSON> Santee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> lakes created in World War II to provide hydroelectric power to underdeveloped areas and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s defense-related industries State and company officials say the hard claystone from which the landfill is carved makes it a natural location. But siting standards for hazardous waste landfills are only now being drafted and are not expected before the end of 1989. <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> has decided not to wait for the standards to make a decision on the landfill's permit, and officials say they can be applied retroactively. GSX encases its waste in two layers of clay 3 feet and 5 feet thick, separated by two hard plastic liners and a leak detection system. The waste is tested on arrival to ensure that it's not flammable, radioactive, explosive or laced with dioxin, then it is mixed with concrete and buried. `` GSX is doing a good job in doing what they're doing. I think they're handling it in a safe manner,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Some area opponents, however, say constantly changing burial requirements have made them unwilling participants in a test of developing technology. When federal regulations changed in 1985 from one layer of clay and plastic to two, earlier burial cells were not retrofitted. And a monitoring system crucial for detecting leaks has been upgraded from eight to about 50 wells since 1983. `` As technology progresses, we adopt it,'' said GSX Vice President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Certainly nobody's claiming perfection, but we just do the best we know how to do.'' <PERSON> Hallman </PERSON>, a Republican who calls <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> `` the septic tank of the nation,'' has organized a bipartisan environmental caucus of 18 state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members he hopes will push legislation endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> board phasing out permanent burial of chemical waste by 1992 and creating a state-owned disposal site so <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> could refuse out-of-state waste. Court rulings have said that prohibitions on out-of-state waste headed to a private facility interfere with interstate commerce. The <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> board also called for burial fee increases from $ 13 to $ 95 per ton for in-state waste and $ 18 to $ 180 per ton for out-of-state waste. The money would go into an existing state fund to be used for any cleanup at the site. A 1985 <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> study estimated that cleanup costs would approach $ 1 billion if all of the landfill's holding cells were breached. The state requires only $ 6 million in insurance, though <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> maintains a $ 30 million policy. House members rank the <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> proposals second behind the politically charged issue of auto insurance reform among the biggest issues facing them this year. The proposals will be challenged by manufacturers _ including the state's biggest industry, textiles _ who use the GSX site extensively. They say such moves could increase costs and mean the loss of jobs. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> voted in December to fight. `` Closing of the facility would create more problems than it would solve and could lead to improper disposal of hazardous waste in other locations,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, chairman of the group's environmental committee. A November public hearing on the GSX permit drew a rowdy crowd of 2,000 people, many of whom stayed seven hours to berate <ORGANIZATION> DHEC </ORGANIZATION> and GSX. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Boykin </PERSON>, who first opposed the landfill and helped organize Citizens Asking for a Safe Environment after a 1984 hearing, says it has mobilized her as she expects <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> and the other environmental dilemmas to affect others. `` We grew up truly believing that government would protect us,'' she said. `` I think we've come to realize that our state and federal government are not necessarily going to protect us. We're going to have to protect ourselves.''

 The long Palestinian uprising has brought bitterness to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> humor, and the comedian's opener was not meant to put his audience at ease. `` Soldiers in uniform get in with a discount,'' <PERSON> Yonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> said, and after a pause: `` Soldiers with clubs get in free.'' He referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where more than 300 Palestinians have been killed and thousands wounded. Such a joke would have been unthinkable before the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. In night clubs, theaters and galleries, artists of various kinds grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the brutalizing effect on Israeli society of the army's handling of the uprising. A satire by nightclub performer <PERSON> Dudu </PERSON> <PERSON> Topaz </PERSON> takes the form of an army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young Palestinian urinated on a soldier's leg. The army arrests his entire family and destroys their house, and an officer declares on the radio: `` The youth was known as a potential terrorist.'' A reporter finds the perpetrator, but discovers he is not yet old enough to talk. Performing artists have collided with those who control state-run radio and television. <PERSON> Topaz </PERSON> was barred from a radio talk show for two weeks for comments critical of the army. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television rejected a skit by comedian <PERSON> Tuvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzafir </PERSON> that attacked public apathy by depicting an Israeli family watching TV while a fire raged outside. Lyrics in `` Coexistence With Love,'' a new album by vocalist <PERSON> Astar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, accuse the government of failing to explore options for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation. As one of her songs, `` A Moment Before the Storm,'' puts it: `` My brother is n't a cruel soldier, but he's cold in his soul. He stands there with his hand on the trigger, but he hates the war. ... Do n't send my brother to the trigger. Ms. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in an interview: `` When I sat opposite the television last January, and they started showing me what was happening, I could n't sleep nights. I know songs do n't change things and ca n't move armies, but ... they just came pouring out.'' Early last year, army radio banned pop singer <PERSON> Si </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>'s song `` Shooting and Crying'' about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury four young Palestinians alive in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. The victims survived, and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year. `` Have we forgotten our children were killed, too?'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> asks in the chorus, alluding to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> extermination of 6 million Jews. In a <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> nightclub, <PERSON> Tzafir </PERSON> performs a skit accusing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of ignoring opportunities for peace. It depicts <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a wall chart that says, `` There are Palestinians,'' and in smaller letters, `` There is a chance for peace.'' `` My vision is too good,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> says. `` I need something to block all this out.'' Palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs and plays. Words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward rhetoric: `` With the Molotov -LRB- gasoline bomb -RRB-, with the stones, I make my revolution. ... With the stones, we get rid of the enemy.'' An art exhibit at the Hakawati Theatre in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was a series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion. The new play `` Waiting for the Savior'' depicts buffoon-like <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers harassing Palestinians going about their daily lives. `` Everything is political,'' said <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghosheh </PERSON>, director of the theater. `` We are talking about our lives. Our lives are political.'' For Israeli performers, who do active and reserve army duty like everyone else, it is more complicated. At one point in his show, <PERSON> Topaz </PERSON> stopped and said, `` I wonder if I have the right to do this. I'm laughing at everyone, but I'm laughing at myself as well, because I, too, am a soldier. The comedian, whose father came here from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said in an interview: `` This is not the country I wanted. It's not the kind of behavior I want. If someone had told my father he was coming to live in a country that would rule another nation, he never would have come.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Reagan Takes High Road in Farewell Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took the high road in his farewell address after two recent attempts to blame some of his administration's most notable failures on congressional meddling or the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> establishment. `` Tonight is n't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue,'' the president said in his televised message Wednesday night. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sounded positive notes reminiscent of earlier speeches throughout his political career _ the pre-eminent position of `` We the People'' in the American system, the image of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a shining `` city upon a hill,'' the importance of paying more attention to American history. There was no mention of the `` iron triangle'' of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the news media and special interest groups who, in a speech to political appointees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 13, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> claimed had prevented his administration from balancing the federal budget. Nor did he argue, as he did in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> Dec. 16, that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had perpetuated a dangerous situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by its `` on-again, off-again indecisiveness'' on his program of aid to the anti-communist Contra rebels. There was no mention at all of the Contras, the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or the enormous trade deficits that during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tenure have turned <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into the world's biggest debtor nation. Instead, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stuck to the simple, patriotic themes that have served him so well in his political career. `` There is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time,'' the president said. The best-known such warnings are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s caution in 1797 against `` entangling alliances'' and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s message in 1961 about the excessive influence of `` the military-industrial complex. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not come up with a similar catchword. Rather, he asked a question: `` Are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is and what she represents in the long history of the world?'' He did n't give an outright answer to that question, but he made it pretty clear that he thinks things have gone awry. `` Younger parents are n't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the right thing to teach modern children,'' he said. `` And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the style. `` We've got to do a better job of getting across that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is freedom.'' It was an inspirational message, unlikely to arouse the kind of criticism that greeted his attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the `` iron triangle.'' Instead of blaming <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for his failures, he thanked the people for his successes. `` I've had my share of victories in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but what very few people noticed is that I never won anything you did n't win for me,'' he said. `` They never saw my troops; they never saw <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s regiments, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. He even modestly differed from the phrase so often used to describe his skills at exactly what he was doing Wednesday night. `` I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference _ it was the content,'' he said. `` I was n't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they did n't spring full blown from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation `` My friends, we did it.'' In foreign affairs, he said he wanted `` the new closeness'' with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to continue but warned that it can do so `` only as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner.'' It was a sentimental speech unlikely to go into history with those by <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as they concluded their presidencies. But it was a speech that celebrated what he called `` common sense'' and encapsulated his relationship to the people in simple imagery. `` One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart,'' he said. `` You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass _ the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and could n't return. And so many times I wanted to stop, and reach out from behind the glass, and connect.'' Whatever else it was, it was vintage <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Farmers Union Opposes Decoupling Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says it will wage a lobbying battle in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against a proposal to let farmers collect federal subsidies without regard to the kind of crops they produce. <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said Wednesday that the idea, known as `` decoupling,'' would be `` devastating for farmers and rural communities, endanger the environment and destabilize the position of Third World farmers.'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said at a news conference that decoupling would be a `` short-term welfare program'' and will be opposed vigorously by <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists. The idea of decoupling has been around for years but has not had great support on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. One of the early decisions by the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be whether to embrace decoupling as a way of containing government farm costs. Under some versions of decoupling, federal payments targeted to farmers would gradually be reduced over four or five years and perhaps then be eliminated altogether as producers are weaned from federal crop subsidies. The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION>'s main rival, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, at one time supported decoupling but since has backed off to give it a closer look. One of the biggest advocates is the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based conservative think tank, which recently issued a report saying that one of the first jobs of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should be to cut subsidies and `` get farmers off the dole.'' Decoupling, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> report said, would allow federal payments to farmers to be based on a flat rate and targeted to those most in need. As it has been for more than half a century, payments now are pegged to specific kinds of crops and levels of production _ the larger the farm, the larger the subsidy. Under decoupling, farmers would simply be given a cash payment and then be free to grow or not grow any crop they choose. `` Planting decisions would then be based on market signals _ consumer demand for a product _ rather than on what is required by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> report said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON>, who wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> report, said in a telephone interview that decoupling makes sense as a way of getting crop programs away from government subsidies and into a market-oriented economic environment. `` In my judgment, it's a charade now to think that most of the production that is linked to subsidy payments is being grown for the marketplace,'' <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON> said. `` It's a mindset, almost like a crutch.'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, however, called decoupling proposals a `` cop-out'' and released a report analyzing a decoupling bill introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., in 1985 as the Family Farm Protection and Full Production Act <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said the bill continues to have some support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, along with backing from big grain companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's really a cop-out in addressing the real issue of adopting and implementing a farm program which enhances the market price for agricultural commodities,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. `` It implies that the family farm structure of agriculture is not important.'' The analysis used figures attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, showing that the <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> bill would reduce federal price support loans sharply for major crops, including wheat to $ 1.60 per bushel from $ 2.06 this year, and corn to $ 1.30 per bushel from the 1989 rate of $ 1.65. `` Lowering of world prices, a result of decoupling, would aggravate the situation of Third World farmers, who are our best potential customers for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food exports,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION>, he said, will draft its own alternative to decoupling to `` assure consumers an adequate and dependable supply of food'' and `` enhance the market price of agricultural commodities.'' Although <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> did not disclose details of what <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION>'s plan might include, he said it would `` reduce the budget impact of farm programs'' and allow for continued expansion of agricultural exports. The 1988 drought helped siphon off huge stockpiles of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain, boosting market prices for wheat to an average of $ 3.89 per bushel last month from $ 2.70 a year earlier. Corn in December, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, averaged $ 2.54 per bushel, compared with the year-earlier mark of $ 1.72 per bushel. <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> was asked if the <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> would recommend an increase in federal price supports to as much as current market prices. He replied, `` Or higher.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for eight years has been committed to a market-oriented farm policy, less reliance on federal controls and freer world trade. Those goals are expected to continue under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. But <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> is not convinced at this time that foreign countries will go along with current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade objectives in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration any more than they have in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` There is n't such a thing as a free market,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. `` It does n't exist, will not exist, either in this country or any other major exporting country in the world.''

 Oil refinery workers nationwide began returning to work Wednesday, ending a series of strikes and rallies to protest the bloody arrest of their union bosses on weapons and corruption charges. The government continued its crackdown on <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, leader of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He and about 50 associates have been arrested on fraud, weapons and tax evasion charges, said a spokesman for the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Meanwhile, authorities said two of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s bodyguards _ who were arrested in the sweep _ reported that their boss ordered the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a union local, officials said. The attorney general's office said in a statement late Wednesday that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told investigators he purchased scores of weapons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told investigators the weapons were brought into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by his `` good friend,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, a former mayor of <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, the statement said. <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> gave the weapons to <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> on Dec. 10, it said. <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, which has a refinery and petrochemicals plant, lies across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border from <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It is a stronghold of oil workers allied with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>. Strikes by refinery workers broke out Tuesday night after the arrests began. The union corruption investigation is widely seen as a challenge to the union by the new administration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. Guards were posted at gas stations and refineries and many motorists, fearing shortages, formed 30 - and 40-car lines to fill up their tanks at stations in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> and other cities But petroleum workers began showing up at their jobs later Wednesday after a union official called for the strikes to end. `` They -LRB- workers -RRB- should report for work. They should forget marches, work stoppages and rallies because, despite the protest of the union of the arbitrary arrest of its leaders, we do not want to affect the industry or the population,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, acting coordinator of the union. He said the message was from <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, the union secretary-general, who was under arrest at a cardiology hospital on Wednesday. <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> reportedly checked into the hospital after the arrests began. <PERSON> Vania </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state-owned oil monoply <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, said production of crude oil and petrochemicals has returned to normal. `` We are all going back to work to show that we do not have any problem with the company,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, 23, a worker at the <ORGANIZATION> Ciudad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madero </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s hometown, 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> It was not known how many workers struck Tuesday and how many returned. Some refineries were harder hit than others. About 4,200 of the 6,000 workers had failed to report for early shifts Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicanos </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicanos </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said production was reduced to `` less than half'' of his company's daily capacity of 185,000 barrels of gasoline. But operations were reported back to normal at the <LOCATION> Azcapotzalco </LOCATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday when soldiers blew down his door with a bazooka rocket in a raid on his home in northeastern <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION> city, the <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> state news agency said. One federal agent was killed in the ensuing shootout with <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s bodyguards, said Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>. He denied the arrest was an attack on the union, saying: `` It is the prosecution of crime committed by individuals.'' Police confiscated 200 Uzi machine guns at the house, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> said. Numerous weapons also were found at <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s home. Two bodyguards of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told authorities Wednesday that he ordered them to take part in the 1983 killing of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancardo </PERSON>, a union local leader and mayor of <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state, where an oil refinery is located, a source at the attorney general's office said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> has had a long-running feud with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who took office Dec. 1, and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> until about a year ago when he left to become governor of the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, then budget and planning secretary, and <PERSON> Beteta </PERSON> had cut into the lucrative business <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and the union had enjoyed through the control of millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> subcontracts. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the world's sixth-largest crude oil producer. Production from the country's nine refineries is 1.4 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>Architect of Nixon Privilege Claim Considered for Top Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> professor who helped mount President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s unsuccessful attempt to resist a key Watergate subpoena is being considered for the post of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> solicitor general. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 61, a civil law expert and scholar who helped formulate the executive-privilege claim for refusing to surrender tapes of Oval Office conversations during the Watergate affair, is one of five or six candidates under consideration for the job, said a source close to the selection process. Also being considered are Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> of the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They are among the candidates being considered by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team in conjunction with Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the appointment, which must be confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would not be made without <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s consent. The job of the department's top legal policy maker and chief appellate lawyer will be vacated when Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON> leaves office Jan. 20 to return to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The solicitor general decides whether the government will appeal lower court rulings against federal agencies in virtually all cases. He personally argues many cases before the high court. The solicitor general is called the 10th justice in legal circles because he is traditionally viewed by the high court as a source of legal guidance. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> law professor, served as one of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s lawyers in 1973 and 1974 while the Watergate special prosecutor was trying to subpoena the White House tapes. He helped devise the constitutional argument that as president, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was immune from judicial subpoena because of executive privilege <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 8-0 in 1974 that executive privilege did not protect <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> from having to surrender evidence needed in a criminal case. The decision led to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation. The high court ordered <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to turn over the tapes, which contained damaging evidence of White House involvement in the Watergate cover-up. Winter, 53, a former <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who took the bench in 1982, and <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a fellow appointee of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, are both known as judicial conservatives. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, who served as counselor to Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from 1981 prior to taking the bench in 1983, had been mentioned as a possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee after his former colleague on the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> circuit, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, failed to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation in 1987. There is speculation in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> legal community that because of his relative youth, the 42-year-old <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> would be willing to give up his lifetime judicial appointment to better position himself for a future nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is an unpredictable conservative, who has not always voted with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on major cases before the appeals court here. He is viewed by some as a more moderate member of the conservative wing of the circuit, which also includes Judges <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. While best known for his role as a defender of executive privilege during Watergate, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has a formidable reputation as a legal scholar, particularly as an expert on federal court procedure. He is the coauthor of a multi-volume standard textbook on the subject and has argued before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, notably against the abolition of the death penalty and against lowering the voting age to 18. He lost both of those cases. His position on the death penalty, however, was ultimately vindicated when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later reinstated capital punishment. A professed conservative Republican, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wrote in 1960 that he supported <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy because: `` I have more confidence in <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> the man than in <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> the man.'' But four years later, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would vote against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> because he felt the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> senator supported a `` slowdown on civil rights'' and would take a `` harder, more dangerous line on foreign relations.''

 STOCKTON-ON-TEES, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Minns </PERSON> received $ 160,000 from the father he never knew and thought was killed in World War II. <PERSON> Minns </PERSON>, 44, said Wednesday that he grew up believing his soldier father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Minns </PERSON>, died in the war, and was astonished when lawyers tracked him down and told him that for 40 years his father was in a hospital 50 miles away. <PERSON> Minns </PERSON>, a dairy worker and father of four, said he then discovered his father had not had a visitor in the hospital for 38 years. `` I'm heartbroken,'' he said. `` It would have meant a lot to meet him.'' <PERSON> Minns </PERSON>, offspring of a wartime romance, was born illegitimate. He was brought up by his aunt, who died when he was 15. He said he only learned his father was a war-stress patient at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicholas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gosforth </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after he died two years ago. `` The news was a considerable shock,'' he said. `` I feel bitter because certain relatives knew about him and kept it to themselves.'' `` The money is n't important.

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is supporting longtime <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s bid to be the next party chairman, giving the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney labor's influential backing in the five-man race. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> announced the endorsement Wednesday following a 90-minute meeting of president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and 16 other members of its national political committee. The endorsement was announced in a two-sentence statement that said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was the `` consensus'' choice of those at the meeting. It did not list any reason for the endorsement or refer to public endorsements of another candidate, former Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, by building-trades unions affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 404 votes on the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>, 46 are cast by union representatives. But labor's influence is considered far greater than those numbers suggest. All five candidates to succeed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leaders last week in hopes of securing the endorsement. `` This endorsement represents a vote of confidence by the representatives of the working men and women of this country,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state party chairman, are viewed as the front-runners to replace <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has the support of many national Democrats, but few if any of them vote. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s base stems from his role as president of the Assocation of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairs The other candidates are former congressmen <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. All five last week began a series of joint regional meetings around the country. The <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> will pick a successor to <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> next month. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is a veteran party insider who advised the unsuccessful presidential campaign of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Critics of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s candidacy argue that his election would suggest that the party is lining up behind <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s liberal stands. Among such critics is <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a moderate who said Wednesday evening that his `` campaign continues to move forward'' despite the labor endorsement of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>.

 To avoid identifying several Latin American government officials as working for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration withheld certain documents from the trial of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Quoting unidentified sources close to the Iran-Contra inquiry, the newspaper says the administration feared that any discussion of the documents in court might disrupt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence in several countries. One source said some of the withheld documents were declassified during congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, but were later reclassified in an effort to limit discussion of the incidents they describe, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said. Special prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked that the two major charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> be dismissed after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused to allow certain documents to be used in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is expected to act on <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s request this week. The newspaper said some of its sources are closely tied to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense team while others either worked closely with <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the past or participated in the 1987 congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair. One of the sources is a senior administration official who advises the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Central American security policy, the newspaper said. Countries listed in the documents, the sources said, include <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> where _ respectively _ North's resupply network aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels built an airstrip, controlled part of an air base and attempted to buy military aircraft. North's activities in these countries were central to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s legal strategy to show that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide conspired to defraud the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and steal government property by using the profits from arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to purchase supplies for the Contras Those are the charges <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says he must withdraw. In each case, the sources said, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has documentary evidence, including invoices, receipts and other legal papers, showing transactions involving <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales profits and Contra supplies.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assurance of continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support until the Angolan government reaches a settlement with him, according to a published report today.

But Blight and <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday that it remains unclear whether <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON> reversed or circumvented the decision on his own or convinced <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> of its perils. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said the order was reversed just hours before Soviet ships reached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. The book, `` On the Brink: Americans and Soviets Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis,'' is based largely on two 1987 conferences sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> _ one that featured top <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> advisers and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scholars and a second in which three Soviets joined the Americans. The book will serve as a backdrop for a third conference scheduled for Jan. 27-29 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> featuring, for the first time, Soviet, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials who participated in the crisis, which was triggered when Soviet troops began installing missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> capable of reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Secret correspondence between <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> concerning the missile crisis is expected to be released at the conference, according to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials. The book said <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s order to ignore the blockade was disclosed in a largely unknown work by dissident Soviet historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> authors said much of the information has been confirmed independently by <PERSON> Mikoyan </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Sergo </PERSON>, who was an aide to his father during the crisis. The authors also conclude that the missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> probably did not have warheads. Their theory that the warheads were blocked by the quarantine is at odds with a recent disclosure by <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Alekseev </PERSON>, the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, who said in a recent Soviet magazine that 42 medium-range missiles were fully operational. But the authors suggested that <PERSON> Alekseev </PERSON>, along with others in the Soviet diplomatic corps, were not receiving accurate information from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> about the missiles.

 It was not the type of ceremonial presentation that a governor makes every day, but it was n't in recognition of the kind of senatorial circumstance that arises every day, either.

He was there for nearly an hour before maintenance workers got clearance to take the door apart and let him out. `` I heard that you had had some difficulty and thought this might be of some value to you if this unfortunate type of thing happens again,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. `` Governor, I accept this in the spirit in which it is given and, believe me, I wo n't leave home without it,'' <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> said.

 Skiers and operators of fashionable resorts in the Alps and Dolomites are facing a severe dry spell that has left northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> snowless and caused sharp losses to the multimillion-dollar ski industry. But in the long term, the dryness may be most damaging to farmers in the plains. Their national association claimed this week that this year's harvests of wheat and barley are being jeopardized by the lack of moisture. It also said an expected lowering in river levels may hurt rice farming in the Po valley this spring. `` If it does not snow, and a lot, within this month we will have no water to submerge 150,000 hectares -LRB- 370,500 acres -RRB- of rice,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Pusterla </PERSON>, a top official of the Italian Agricultural Confederation. `` In the meantime drought is already causing damage to seedlings.'' The latest snowfall on the Italian side of the Alps date back to early December, when an average of eight inches of fresh snow elated owners of hotels and ski lifts. Not a single drop of rain or a flake of snow has since been spotted in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Dozens of tourists upset by the lack of snow and poor accommodations protested in <LOCATION> Salice </LOCATION> d'Ulzio, near the French border, forcing local authorities to negotiate repayment of a share of their pre-paid vacations. Unusually high temperatures prevented the use of snowmakers, considered a good defense in case of late winter snowfalls in resorts such as <LOCATION> Sestriere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Courmayeur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bormio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> di Campiglio and <PERSON> Selva </PERSON> <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardena </PERSON>. Resorts had spent several million dollars to install batteries of snow-making equipment on Alpine slopes. Snow bulletins issued weekly by tourist offices list an increasing number of closed ski lifts and cable cars. The highest Alpine ski tracks _ above 6,000 feet _ report no more than 12 to 16 inches. The few resorts with favorable ski conditions because of their shady positions were invaded by thousands of Chrismas holiday skiers _ quickly spoiling their slopes. The unusual high pressure over northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also touched off several consecutive days of thick fog in the plains, which closed airports, hampered road traffic and caused pile-ups on highways. `` We can only hope that snow comes soon and plentifully, to salvage a tourist season already compromised,'' says <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Prossliner </PERSON>, who runs a luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Badia </LOCATION>, near the Austrian border. Some international cross-country races scheduled in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in mid-January were canceled for lack of snow while World Cup races early in December were held with some difficulty on artificial snow. Several of the early races of the competition <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> were rescheduled last month. However, the three neighboring <LOCATION> Alpine </LOCATION> countries have had some recent snowfalls of 14 to 40 inches. Some members of the environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claim a steady rise in winter temperatures and the frequent dry spells are the result of the `` greenhouse effect'', or climactic warming, resulting from <LOCATION> humankind </LOCATION>'s burning of fossil fuels. However, <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlistovsky </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Brera </LOCATION> metereologic institute in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, said this winter's dry spell was not exceptional and several worse years have been registered since 1950. `` People have a slippery memory. Certainly winter has begun later than usual in some recent years, but it lasted longer,'' she explained.

 `` Desire Under the Elms,'' a new opera based on <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s play of the same name, is blessed with a story perfect for opera _ full of rivalry, greed, sex and violence. Soprano <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, who won a Tony on Broadway last year, stars in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Opera Repertory Theater production, and is splendid in the pivotal role of <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON>. But the music composed by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> does n't have all the power it needs. The opera had its first staged presentation Wednesday at the City Center. Operas these days are melodic, minimalist or have a jagged vocal line that does n't sound like a melody to most listeners. `` Desire Under the Elms'' is of the latter kind. That's fine and this opera sounds good much of the time. But in arias expressing emotion for instance, it often sounds bland. A lullaby is a departure from the rest of the music. But when a very dramatic moment comes, that music should also be a departure, hitting some heights. In `` Desire Under the Elms,'' the drama is principally carried by the situation and the words being sung. <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> marries elderly <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> -LRB- bass <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> -RRB-, seduces his son <PERSON> Eben </PERSON> -LRB- tenor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwisow </PERSON> -RRB- and has a baby. <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eben </PERSON> each want total ownership of the farm on which they live. So the stew of sex, love and deception is further stirred by mistrust of love based on what any one might do to get the farm. The orchestral scoring is n't heavy so most of the words could be understood. The men's voices were good but not big, an appraisal which extends to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimann </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, as two older sons who leave home before <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> arrives. Miss <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>'s voice most nearly filled the house. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Opera Repertory Theater was founded in 1977 by <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who conducted the opera. It is dedicated to creation and performance of opera and new music theater. Composer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is a native of <LOCATION> Chisholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Masteroff </PERSON>, who wrote the book for Broadway's `` She Loves Me'' and `` Cabaret,'' is making his debut as a librettist `` Desire Under the Elms'' was done in a workshop at the O'Neill Theater Center's National Music Theater Conference, in its first year, 1978. It also has had concert performances. The set for this first staged presentation was a cutaway two-story house by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anania </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> designed costumes and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gately </PERSON> directed. It will be performed again on Friday and Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> says he no longer can rule out the possibility charges may be brought against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> companies reported to have helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a suspected chemical weapons factory. West German officials have for weeks denied discovering any evidence supporting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that West German firms helped build the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. But several West German news reports on Wednesday said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> companies played a major role in supplying equipment for and assisting in the construction of the plant, which <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> contends is not a chemical weapons but a pharmaceutical plant. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told a news conference that a team of West German experts left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday to discuss the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations in more detail. Asked about the new accusations that West German companies were involved in the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, he said: `` All evidence will be investigated thoroughly. I can not exclude that there may be some evidence that could stand up in court.'' But the West German leader emphasized that his government must have such evidence `` before action is taken. `` The government can not ground its action on speculation,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Federal officials already have confirmed that a criminal investigation has begun against a now-defunct <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> firm, I.B.I. Engineering, and that investigators had seized company documents. But they told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that no proof had been yet found that West German companies were involved in the Libyan plant. However, in its evening news report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network showed what it said were documents seized by customs officials that allegedly show transactions between the Imhausen-Chemie company and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The names of I.B.I. and <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> could be read on some of the documents, but the exact nature of the papers was not clear. Stern magazine reported in today's editions that I.B.I. was deeply involved in the Libyan plant along with Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> and the Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Pen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsao </ORGANIZATION> medical material company. Imhausen-Chemie and <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> were cleared in an initial audit last week. All three companies have been named by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in their accusations _ delivered privately to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> authorities _ that West German firms aided <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in building the plant A <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed Wednesday that I.B.I. was now under investigation. He said the West German <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting the investigation, had seized I.B.I. documents as part of the probe. Stern magazine said the documents had been in the possession of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, which it identified as a tax adviser to I.B.I. owner <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbouti </PERSON>, an Iraqi national. `` The investigators are looking into whether I.B.I. shipped goods to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and whether they required an export permit,'' said the official. He said a Belgian transport company, <ORGANIZATION> Crosslink </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, was being probed by Belgian officials and that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had asked authorities in the neighboring country to assist in the I.B.I. investigation. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said many of I.B.I.'s deliveries were carried out by an unidentified shipper in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>. It named no sources in its report, but said the material was based on official documents and first-person reports. The Hamburg-based magazine claimed I.B.I. `` to a large extent organized the total project in the Libyan desert.'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said federal authorities have confiscated documents showing that I.B.I., Imhausen-Chemie and <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> were involved in the Libyan project. It said <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> delivered `` everything that is needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I. The magazine alleged that some of the materials were shipped by <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsao </PERSON> under bills of lading to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but actually delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims its new plant will produce pharmaceuticals, not poison gas or other biological weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims it has evidence to the contrary, and those claims have been supported by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which says it has independent confirmation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> preoccupation with the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant led <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to accuse the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of planning an air strike to knock it out. On Jan. 4, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-14 jet fighters shot down two Libyan warplanes over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> about 600 miles from the plant. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> claimed the downings were provoked by aggressive and threatening actions by armed Libyan aircraft, while <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said its jets were unarmed and on a reconaissance flight over international waters.

<HEAD>Tobacco-Spitting Contest at High School Breaks District Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ODESSA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students who participated in a school-approved tobacco-spitting contest sought to recapture the days of the Old West, but they also violated state and local regulations, officials say. Six students at <ORGANIZATION> Odessa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city took part in the after-school event Tuesday as Vice Principal <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsley </PERSON> and economics teacher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> cheered from the sidelines. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Education Code and school district policy prohibit use of tobacco products at school-sponsored events. State Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said Wednesday he was disappointed to hear about the contest, and would investigate. Principal <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Starnes </PERSON> said he would talk to the teacher and administrator who staged the contest, which was part of Western Week celebrations. <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, who is sponsor for the school <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said he obtained approval for the contest from <PERSON> Horsley </PERSON> and was aware of district policy banning tobacco use on school property. `` We sat around and tried to think of pastime activities associated with the Old West,'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said. `` We were going to do the cow patty bingo, but we found out from an attorney that that's considered gambling, so we did n't do it.'' `` I just thought it was unusual circumstances and would n't hurt anybody,'' <PERSON> Horsley </PERSON> said. `` I know it's a violation. ... I was wrong, but I hate to see something big made out of something like that.'' <PERSON> Starnes </PERSON> said he was aware of the contest, but said <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> had been `` instructed to use Tootsie Rolls. I think -LRB- <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> -RRB- was trying to use prunes, too, but he had some reservations about that.''

<HEAD>Why Thrifts Fail, And Who Pays To Insure Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More savings and loans failed in 1988 than in any year since the Depression. This year, taxpayers may be asked to pick up the cost of rescuing the industry _ and the price could run into the billions of dollars. Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about the problem. Q: How are depositors' savings protected? A: The first line of defense when an institution fails is a government insurance fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The ultimate backing, if the fund runs out of money, is the taxpayer. On several occasions <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, most recently in 1987, has reaffirmed that the full faith and credit of the federal government stands behind the deposits. Q: Does that mean the government would pay the depositors if the S & amp; L went out of business? A: Yes, as long as the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L has federal insurance. In most cases the insurance fund tries to avoid direct depositor payoffs. Instead, the government `` rescues'' the institution by providing new owners with a mixture of cash, promissory notes and other guarantees to wipe out the old losses. The new owners also invest some of their own money and the institution stays open, usually under a new name. The old managers lose their jobs, the stockholders lose their investment but depositors are protected. Q: How does the FSLIC work? A: The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> guarantees deposit accounts up to $ 100,000 in nearly 3,000 S & amp; Ls. -LRB- Similarly, government insurance also protects savers in commercial banks through the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NCUA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- stands behind credit unions. -RRB- Q: Where do the insurance funds get their money? A: From the institutions whose deposits they insure. S & amp; Ls, for instance, pay a premium of 21 cents a year for every $ 100 in deposits. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> also has been raising money by selling 30-year bonds, which will be paid off by the premiums from the industry. And, it sells property from failed institutions to recover some of its costs. Q: If S & amp; Ls fund the insurance plan, why do people say the public will end up paying? A: The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has recently acknowledged that income from the industry wo n't be enough to cover savings accounts in failed S & amp; Ls and, therefore, the public will have to bear much of the cost. Industry trade groups say healthy institutions will start going under if they're forced to pay higher premiums. Q: How would the public pay? A: This is not clear. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is working on a plan for President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Private analysts believe that in some manner tax money will be needed. The solution could involve a direct appropriation of taxpayer funds. Or, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could authorize regulators to borrow what they need with the understanding that taxpayer funds will be used to pay the interest. Or, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could impose fees on members of the public, such as home buyers, who benefit from the S & amp; L system. Q: What is the controversy about the 1988 bailouts? Keeping a money-losing institution alive means it could continue to lose money under new owners, eventually making another rescue necessary. The government protects the new owners from losing money on loans made by the previous owners. Critics think the new owners ought to share more of the risk as an incentive to manage the loan portfolio wisely. Also, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are angry because in some cases private buyers are reaping tax breaks from the deals that are worth more than they are paying to take possession of failed institutions. They say regulators ought to have been able to get more cash from the buyers in exchange for the tax benefits. Q: Why do regulators think the bailout approach will ultimately save money for the taxpayers? A: If the government simply shuts down an institution, it has to spend enormous amounts immediately to pay off depositors _ more money than the regulators have. Over a period of years, it then hopes to get back some of it by selling loans and repossessed property from the failed S & amp; L. By rescuing an institution, the government pays only for the loss, not for the entire amount of insured deposits. And, it gets to spread out the cost, typically for as long as 10 years. Also, most institutions have a certain value as a going concern _ such as a loyal customer base _ that would be destroyed if they were liquidated. In 1988, new S & amp; L owners pumped $ 3 billion into the rescued institutions in exchange for this value. In December, regulators `` resolved'' the cases of 75 S & amp; Ls at an estimated cost of $ 15.5 billion to the insurance fund and $ 4 billion in tax breaks. The ultimate cost of liquidating those <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would have been $ 22.8 billion, however, and the insurance fund would have had to immediately come up with $ 47 billion in `` up-front cash.'' Q: How did we get in this fix in the first place? A: Inflation and high interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s put most S & amp; Ls in a bind. They were forced to pay more to attract deposits than they were earning on long-term mortgages already on their books. One of the `` solutions'' was to allow savings and loans to expand beyond traditional mortgage lending and invest in commercial real estate and other projects, which earn higher rates of return and require only a short-term commitment by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L. The new rules attracted a new class of S & amp; L owner, now called `` high-fliers.'' They were particularly prevalent in states with more liberal S & amp; L rules such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Unfortunately, the new investments made by high-fliers were riskier. When the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy collapsed because of plummeting oil prices, borrowers stopped making payments and much of the commercial real estate serving as collateral was worth only a fraction of its previous value. At the same time S & amp; Ls were entering unfamiliar territory, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was cutting back on its force of examiners. It was only in 1985, when regulators arranged to have the examination force taken off budget, that S & amp; Ls began to be more closely supervised. In some cases outright fraud contributed to the losses. A Justice Department-led task force, operating in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since 1987, has obtained indictments and convictions of S & amp; L managers. Also, throughout the 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, at the urging of industry lobby groups, consistently refused to provide regulators with enough money to shut down all failed institutions. The institutions stayed open and lost even more money. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also directed regulators to `` forbear'' from taking action against S & amp; Ls in economically distressed areas, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Five snowmobilers said they survived nearly three nights in blizzard conditions by huddling in an aspen grove and melting snow for water after becoming stranded when they ran out of gas. `` There were a few times I thought I might die out there,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON>, 30, said Wednesday. `` It was the scaredest I've ever been.''

<HEAD>149 Nations Sign Diluted Anti-Chemical Weapons Declaration</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An anti-chemical weapons declaration, intentionally crafted in diluted form to satisfy its 149 signatory nations, should help accelerate talks on a ban of toxic arms, officials say. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the only two countries that admit they possess chemical arms, said Wednesday that the document produced by the five-day conference had fallen short of their expectations. The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would have preferred that explicit language be put into the declaration to include sanctions against users of poison gas, nerve gas and other toxic chemical arms. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had written this statement, which we did not, it might have been stronger. This is a consensus document,'' said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a victim of poison gas in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, was among several states that voiced reservations after the declaration's unanimous endorsement. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Kurdish minority _ graphic pictures of peasants killed in Iranian villages heightened concerns last year _ provided a somber backdrop for the conference, which was formally proposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in September. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> succeeded in getting a reference to `` recent violations'' of the protocol in the declaration. But its delegation said it had hoped for a categorical condemnation of past use of toxic weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> said the conference would give life to languishing negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> seeking a verifiable ban on chemical arms. The non-binding declaration reaffirms the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol, which prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and urges negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to `` redouble'' efforts to ban the use, production and stocking of chemical arms. The six-point declaration affirms the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in investigating chemical weapons use and called for a strenthening of existing procedures at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in dealing with such use _ a reference to enacting sanctions. Signers condemned the use of chemical arms, pledging not to use them. Unanimous approval of the final declaration was `` tantamount to saying the whole international community has taken a posture'' against chemical weapons, said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who presided over the conference. `` This unanimity will accelerate ... work underway in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>,'' he said. But the breadth of the declaration, aimed at appeasing all parties, allowed for a broad interpretation that clearly reflected five days of haggling. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said it was `` hard to quantify'' how the declaration could speed up negotiations toward a convention. `` I think it will have an impact on nations. It's bound to strengthen world opinion on the convention,'' <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said. `` Until the end of events recently ... there was very little notice given to what was going on in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In fact I think the whole world thought the dreaded scourge of chemical weapons was gone forever, since World War I.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations that have nuclear arms succeeded in blocking efforts led by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to explicitly link the banning of chemical and nuclear weapons. Arab nations said they wanted to reserve the right to possess chemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. However, hours before the conference closed, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Vice Premier <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states would concede their demand to link nuclear and chemical weapons bans in order to get a consensus. Forty delegations have been holding talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on banning chemical weapons since the early 1980s, but have been stymied by ways to verify a ban on chemical and biological weapons, which include odorless, colorless gases made in plants that can be camoflaged on short notice and laboratory-made toxins derived from fungi. An estimated 20 nations currently have chemical weapons capabilities.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is examining the legal significance of imposing capital punishment on a convicted murderer described as having the mind of a child. The justices heard 60 minutes of arguments Wednesday on whether they will allow the execution of <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>, 32, a convicted rapist-murderer sentenced to die in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The court is expected to announce its decision in July. <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> is said to have the mental capacity of a 7-year-old and the social development of a 9-year-old. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> argued that executing <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> would not violate the Constitution's ban against cruel and inhuman punishment. `` He knew what he was doing,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> raped <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> on Oct. 15, 1979, in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, then stabbed her to death. She was 22. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> recited evidence that <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> killed the woman to prevent her from identifying him. Ms. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s brother, retired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> placekicker <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, was in the courtroom Wednesday and told reporters afterward, `` It's been nine years of hell for myself and my family.'' He said, `` It's not something anyone should have to go through and I feel that if anything good can come out of it, that may be we can render a decision that will make it not happen to someone else.'' Some justices expressed doubts that describing someone as having the mental capacity of a child has much relevance. `` What does it mean to have the mental age of 9?'' asked Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said witnesses for <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> testified he functioned mentally like a 7-year-old and socially like a 9-year-old. `` Beyond that I can not help the court,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` If it's something we do n't understand, why allow -LRB- such evidence -RRB- to be introduced?'' asked Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>, spent little time arguing that all retarded murderers should be spared. Instead, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> challenged the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> death penalty law on narrower grounds. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the law prevented the jury from giving full consideration to evidence in <LOCATION> Penry </LOCATION>'s favor when it determined what sentence to impose. <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> was abused by his parents, attended school only for a few days in the first grade and was in and out of mental hospitals while growing up near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law would let the jury conclude <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> `` is not fully responsible for the way he is today'' and still vote to execute him. He argued the jury only was permitted to consider whether evidence of <PERSON> Penry </PERSON>'s retardation and mistreatment showed that <PERSON> Penry </PERSON> had acted `` deliberately with the reasonable expectation that death would result.'' While the high court might be reluctant to ban the death penalty for all retarded killers, it still could overturn the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> capital punishment law on the narrower grounds cited by <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, whose vote could be pivotal in the case, suggested to <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law gives convicted murderers limited hope of winning reprieve from the death penalty. She questioned whether the state law allows a juror to vote for life in prison even if the juror believed the defendant acted with diminished moral culpability because of his background. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> replied, `` The jury can say, ` My God, this boy's been treated so badly he did n't act deliberately,''' But he acknowledged the jury is barred from weighing such mitigating evidence to reject the death penalty. The case has attracted considerable attention because of its potential impact for all retarded killers.

 Here is the prepared text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell address to the nation Wednesday night My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval Office, and the last. We have been together eight years now, and soon it will be time for me to go. But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some of which I have been saving for a long time. It has been the honor of my life to be your president. So many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say as much to you. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are grateful for the opportunity you gave us to serve. One of the things about the presidency is that you're always somewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass _ the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and could n't return. And so many times I wanted to stop, and reach out from behind the glass, and connect. And maybe I can do a little of that tonight. People ask how I feel about leaving, and the fact is parting is `` such sweet sorrow.'' The sweet part is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and the ranch, and freedom. The sorrow? The goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place. You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the part of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where the president and his family live. There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning. The view is over the grounds here to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument, and then the Mall, and the Jefferson Memorial. But on mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> to the river, the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shore. Someone said that's the view <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> had when he saw the smoke rising from the battle of Bull Run. I see more prosaic things: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river. I have been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant, and mean. And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one _ a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor. It was back in the early'80s, at the height of the boat people, and the sailor was hard at work on the Carrier Midway, which was patrolling the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat _ and crammed inside were refugees from <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> hoping to get to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship, and safety. As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, and stood up and called out to him. He yelled, `` Hello American sailor _ Hello Freedom Man.''

 A small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sailor, who wrote it in a letter, could n't get out of his mind. And, when I saw it, neither could I. Because that's what it was to be an American in the 1980s: We stood, again, for freedom. I know we always have but in the past few years the world _ again, and in a way, we ourselves _ rediscovered it. It has been quite a journey this decade, and we held together through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we are reaching our destination. The fact is, from <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summits, from the recession of'81 and'82 to the expansion that began in late'82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference. The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery, in which the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> created _ and filled _ 19 million new jobs. The other is the recovery of our morale: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is respected again in the world, and looked to for leadership. Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of this. It was back in 1981, and I was attending my first big economic summit, which was held that year in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The meeting place rotates among the member countries. The opening meeting was a formal dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized nations. I sat there like the new kid in school and listened, and it was all <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> this and <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> that. They dropped titles and spoke to one another on a first-name basis. At one point I sort of leaned in and said, `` My name's <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>.'' In that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback: Cut taxes and regulation, started to cut spending. Soon the recovery began. Two years later another economic summit, with pretty much the same cast. At the big opening meeting we all got together, and all of a sudden just for a moment I saw that everyone was looking at me. Then one of them broke the silence. `` Tell us about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> miracle,'' he said. Back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so different. Some pundits said our programs would result in catastrophe. Our views on foreign affairs would cause war, our plans for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse. I even remember one highly respected economist saying, back in 1982, that `` The engines of economic growth have shut down here and across the globe and they are likely to stay that way for years to come...'' Well, he _ and the other `` opinion leaders'' _ were wrong. The fact is, what they called `` radical'' was really `` right;'' what they called `` dangerous'' was just `` desperately needed.'' And in all that time I won a nickname _ `` The Great Communicator.'' But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference _ it was the content. I was n't a great communicator but I communicate great things, and they did n't spring full blown from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation _ from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us for two centuries.

 They called it the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution, and I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like the Great Rediscovery: a rediscovery of our values and our common sense. Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something, the people will produce less of it. So we cut the people's tax rates and the people produced more than ever before. The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and stronger. Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our history: real family income up, the poverty rate down, entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new technology. We are exporting more than ever because <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry became more competitive and at the same time, we summoned the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home. Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace we'd have to become strong again after years of weakness and confusion. So we rebuilt our defenses _ and this New Year we toasted the new peacefulness around the globe. Not only have the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons _ and hope for even more progress is bright _ but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also beginning to cease. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is no longer a war zone, the Soviets are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and an American-mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we are a great nation, our challenges seem complex. It will always be this way. But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours. And something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement, there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world. Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free speech _ and turning away from the ideologies of the past. For them, the Great Rediscovery of the 1980s has been that, lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical way of government. Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive. When you've got to the point where you can celebrate the anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes, review your life and see it flowing before you. For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life. I never meant to go into politics; it was n't my intention when I was young. But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on you. I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to protect something precious. Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reversed the course of government, and with three little words: `` We the People.'' `` We the People'' tell the government what to do, it does n't tell us. `` We the People'' are the driver _ the government is the car. And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast. Almost all the world's consitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which `` We the People'' tell the government what it is allowed to do. `` We the People'' are free. This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I have tried to do these past eight years. But back in the 1960s when I began, it seemed to me that we had begun reversing the order of things _ that through more and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our freedom. I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say, `` Stop!'' I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do.

 I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping. And I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: as government expands, liberty contracts. Nothing is less free than pure communism, and yet we have, the past few years, forged a satsifying new closeness with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. I've been asked if this is n't a gamble and my answer is no, because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds. The detente of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises. They'd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world better, but the gulag was still the gulag, and the state was still expansionist, and they still waged proxy wars in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. This time, so far, it's different: President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He has also freed prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met. But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small incidents. Once, during the heady days of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street, a little street just off <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s main shopping area. Even though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there immediately recognized us, and called out our names and reached for our hands. We were just about swept away by the warmth _ you could almost feel the possibilities in all that joy. But within seconds a KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd. It was an interesting moment. It reminded me that while the man on the street in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> yearns for peace, the government is communist _ those who run it are communists _ and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human rights very differently. We must keep up our guard _ but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust. My view is that President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is different from previous Soviet leaders. I think he knows some of the things wrong with his society and is trying to fix them. We wish him well. And we'll continue to work to make sure that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that eventually emerges from this process is a less threatening one What it all boils down to is this: I want the new closeness to continue. And it will as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner. If and when they do n't _ at first pull your punches. If they persist, pull the plug. It's still trust _ but verify. It's still play _ but cut the cards. It's still watch closely _ and do n't be afraid to see what you see.

 I've been asked if I have any regrets. I do. The deficit is one. I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but tonight is n't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue. But an observation: I've had my share of victories in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you did n't win for me. They never saw my troops; they never saw <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Regiments, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action. Well, action is still needed. If we're to finish the job, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Regiments will have to become the Bush Brigades. Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time. But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of the past eight years: the resurgence of national pride that I called `` the new patriotism.'' This national feeling is good, but it wo n't count for much and it wo n't last unless it's grounded in thoughtfulness and knowledge An informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a good enough job teaching our children what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is and what she represents in the long history of the world? Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a different <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We were taught, very directly, what it means to be an American, and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If you did n't get these things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or the family who lost someone at <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION>. Or you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values and implicitly reinforced the idea that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was special. TV was like that too through the mid - But now we're about to enter the'90s, and some things have changed. Younger parents are n't sure that an unambivalent appreciation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the right thing to teach modern children. And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer in style. Our spirit is back, but we have n't reinstitutionalized it. We've got to do a better job of getting across that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is freedom _ freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise _ and freedom is special and rare It's fragile; it needs protection. We've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion but what's important: Why the pilgrims came here, who <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> was, and what those 30 seconds over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> meant. You know, four years ago, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late father, who'd fought on <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Her name is <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanatta </PERSON> <PERSON> Henn </PERSON>, and she said, we will always remember, we will never forget what the boys of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> did. Well, let's help her keep her word.

 If we forget what we did, we wo n't know who we are. I am warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit. Let's start with some basics _ more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual. And let me offer lesson No. 1 about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: All great change in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> begins at the dinner table. So tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins. And children, if your parents have n't been teaching you what it means to be an American, let'em know and nail'em on it. That would be a very American thing to do. And that's about all I have to say tonight. Except for one thing. The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs I've thought a bit of the shining `` city upon a hill. The phrase comes from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON>, who wrote it to describe the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> he imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early pilgrim _ an early `` Freedom Man.'' He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little wooden boat; and, like the other pilgrims, he was looking for a home that would be free. I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I do n't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace _ a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still. And how stands the city on this winter night? More prosperous, more secure and happier than it was eight years ago. But more than that: after 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home. We've done our part. And as I `` walk off into the city streets,'' a final word to the men and women of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution _ the men and women across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who for eight years did the work that brought <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back: My friends, we did it. We were n't just marking time; we made a difference. We made the city stronger _ we made the city freer _ and we left her in good hands.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other politicians should make adult literacy a national priority and commit up to $ 550 million for promoting it, says a report released today by a nonpartisan research institute. `` The primary need is for leadership,'' says the report, called `` Jump Start: The Federal Role in Adult Literacy'' and issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Southport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisman </PERSON>, author of the study, said he is encouraged by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stated interest in being an `` education president'' and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>'s longtime activism in literacy. <PERSON> Chisman </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Southport </LOCATION>'s Project on <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION>, recommended new federal spending of $ 550 million but said even less would permit `` a quantum leap forward.'' An estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults, some 20 million to 30 million people, lack basic literacy skills. Many are in the work force. <PERSON> Chisman </PERSON> contends this aspect of the literacy problem has the greatest immediate economic importance and should receive more attention. `` Most public and private programs are not available to people who are on the job,'' he wrote. `` Almost all federal resources are targeted on the unemployed or other disadvantaged groups.'' In an accompanying statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she hoped the report would `` lead to a more unified, coherent approach to this major national concern.'' Among <PERSON> Chisman </PERSON>'s recommendations: _ A six-month task force to set literacy goals and means of achieving them, and a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate federal efforts _ Passage of an Adult Basic Skills Act to set up a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION>, establish matching grants for state and local programs, and create a training program for adult literacy workers _ Authorization of basic skills training for the employed under the Job Training Partnership Act

<TEXT>
 A 73-year-old cancer patient says he decided to go to prison as a matter of principle rather than accept a solution to a decade-old dispute over a sewer hookup that would have cost him nothing. `` I'm doing this to show my rights to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a retired metal worker with rectal cancer, said Wednesday as he was taken from his modest <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> home near here to begin a six-month sentence for contempt of court. A large American flag decorated <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s porch and yellow ribbons adorned pine trees in his yard as he tearfully kissed his wife, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>, goodbye. He was then taken to <ORGANIZATION> Lieber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ridgeville </LOCATION>. `` I'm not scared because I'm going to jail.'' But, he said, `` six months is a long time for anybody to go to jail, especially on a charge like this.'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was imprisoned for defying a 1986 court order requiring him to tie his septic tank to a sewer line. The problem began in 1979 when the <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> paid a fee to tap into the line. When the line was installed, it ended at a corner of their lot, too far away, according to <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who said he would have had to spend $ 2,000 and take down four large trees to make the connection. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said the line should be extended in front of the house, where a straight 30-foot connection could be made. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said the utility had been willing to extend the line, but the <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> would have been billed an additional $ 200, which they declined to pay. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said it would cost the public utility about $ 1,200 today to extend the line. He said it would cost only $ 700 to connect to the corner tap, and that district commissioners offered to come out on their own time and dig the ditch. The utility `` bent over backwards'' to resolve the problem, he said. A <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> plumber on Tuesday offered to make the connection for free, but the <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> declined, saying they did n't want charity `` What's the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it in free and you do n't have to pay for it?,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. He added that the <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> were `` just looking for publicity and to get sympathy.'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> on Nov. 1 found <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> in contempt of the 1986 ruling that he make the connection, and gave him 60 days to hook up or go to prison. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who'll appear in court again after serving his sentence, predicted he'll probably be returned to prison. `` I have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewer line,'' he said. He said more than 100 area homes have n't tapped into the system but that he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said the other homes were being handled one by one. The public service district has spent about $ 40,000 in legal fees on the matter, including defending a $ 500,000 federal lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> Siegels </ORGANIZATION> challenging the utility's right to require the connection, officials said. That lawsuit was dismissed last year. It probably will cost more than $ 6,000 to care for <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> during his six-month prison stay, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON>.

Just hours before Wednesday's vote, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had canceled missile tests in the Mediterreanan planned for next week that Libyan Ambassador <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON> had called provocative. The officials gave no hint the cancellation was linked with the resolution. Libyan officials have claimed for weeks that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is preparing public opinion for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on a factory near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> claims has been built for the manufacture of poison gas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the cancellation of the Jan. 16-17 missile tests is intended to reduce tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accuses of fostering international terrorism. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> joined the allies Wednesday in voting against the resolution. The vote was 9-4, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> voting in favor. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> abstained. As permanent members of the 15-member council, any negative vote by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was enough to kill the resolution. The resolution `` deplores the downing of the two Libyan reconnaisssance planes'' and asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to suspend its maneuvers in international waters off <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Treiki disclosed the planned missile tests during <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> debate Tuesday night after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet informed Libyan air traffic controllers so they could divert civilian air traffic. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the canceled exercise was to have involved surface-to-air missiles, not air-to-ground missiles of the type that would be used in any attack on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Deputy U.S. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> announced the cancellation just before the council began debate, and officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> confirmed it. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> the American F-14 pilots fired in self-defense in the Jan. 4 encounter with the Libyan MiG-23s, a right nations have under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter. `` These were not unarmed Libyan reconnaissance aircraft, as this council has been told. They were highly sophisticated fighter aircraft, and we have shown the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the world photographic proof that they were armed,'' <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> displayed photographs of one Libyan jet showing shapes resembling missile pods on its wings and fuselage. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s deputy ambassador, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunni </PERSON> <PERSON> Muntasser </PERSON>, said the pictures were retouched and the planes were unarmed and on reconnaissance flights. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots acted in self-defense. British Ambassador Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said the vetoed resolution was `` couched in the wrong terms and proceeds from wrong assumptions.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>, said the resolution contained `` a one-sided account.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s deputy representative, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Brochand </PERSON>, expressed similar sentiments. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will rotate two aircraft carrier battle groups well away from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as one replaces the other. They said the battle group led by the carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, from which the F-14s flew, would complete its six-month deployment and be replaced by the carrier <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> starting late this week off western <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is asking for a record $ 114 million for its official mailings in 1990, which is, not coincidentally, an election year. The figure is included in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed budget but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> actually draws up its own spending proposal. It is normal for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to about double its mailing costs in election years, even though campaign materials can not be sent with taxpayer money. For fiscal 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has budgeted $ 60.9 million, according to budget documents. In the election year of 1988, however, congressional mailings cost $ 113.3 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is asking that lenders be required to provide home equity loan borrowers with more information about the cost of such loans. Under the rules proposed Wednesday, lenders generally would have to provide potential borrowers with a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the loan at the time of loan application and before any non-refundable fee is collected. The disclosures must include a full explanation of how the interest rate and monthly payments might change and the circumstances under which immediate repayment of the loan could be demanded. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has prohibited lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of the loan after it has been taken out. The Federal Reserve rules would allow changes, such as providing a lower monthly payment over a longer term, provided the borrower agrees to the changes in writing.

 The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen on Thursday, while share prices closed unchanged on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar finished at 126.12 yen, down 0.83 yen from Wednesday's 126.95-yen close The currency, which opened lower at 125.90 yen after its overnight decline on overseas markets, moved in a range of 125.90-126 .22 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 136.94-point gainer for a record 31,143.45 close on Wednesday, finished unchanged from the previous day's close. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed concerted dollar-selling overnight by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and several European central banks on overseas markets, dealers said. Central banks in several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> intervened in exchange markets Wednesday to brake the dollar's recent rise against their respective currencies. The dollar was firmer due to buying by Japanese investors, a dealer with a major commercial bank said. They see the dollar's early January rally as indicating the currency will not fall right away to the low 120-yen range or below, as had been widely expected, the dealer said As long as investors do not anticipate the dollar's rapid decline, their strong appetite for the currency will continue, he added. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, market players were mainly selling issues to prevent the index from rising further, as well as to collect profits after the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s sharp increase since last Thursday, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> achieved some of its most spectacular diplomatic breakthroughs in 1988, and ended the year more than $ 750 million in the red because member nations did n't pay their bills <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> financial spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said Wednesday that just 86 of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through the end of 1988, leaving the world body $ 394.9 million in arrears in the regular budget and $ 355.2 million in debt for peacekeeping operations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s largest contributor, was also the chief `` deadbeat,'' owing 53.5 percent of the total arrears of both budgets _ $ 401.7 million. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was responsible for about 77 percent of the arrears in the regular budget, $ 307.6 million. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> owed 2 percent of the regular budget arrears, $ 9 million. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was responsible for nearly half the arrears in peacekeeping, $ 172.1 million, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was responsible for 26 percent, or $ 94.1 million. The mounting debt exasperated <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> as the world body embarked on new, costly peacekeeping ventures. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers are in charge of monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Aug. 20 cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the Cuban pullout from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s exit from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Other peacekeeping missions are possible this year in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in December, when he accepted the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, that the failure of members to pay dues threatens the work of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to devise a payment schedule for repaying all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears; Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> has said the department told him it would be a three-to-five-year plan. Until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the release of $ 188 million and made the repayment pledge in September, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials had predicted the world body would be unable to meet payrolls by November. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has also pledged to repay all its arrears and has worked out a repayment schedule with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The total regular budget of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is about $ 880 million, of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed one-fourth and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 11.8 percent. In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 10 other nations owe more than $ 1 million to the regular budget: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, $ 33.9 million; <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, $ 7.9 million; <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, $ 5.2 million; <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, $ 4.3 million; <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, $ 4 million; <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, $ 3.5 million; <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, $ 3.1 million; <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, $ 2.8 million; <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, $ 1.4 million; and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, $ 1.2 million.

 They're heading for the last roundup at the 40-year-old Bar Double-R Ranch. But the trail bosses hope they can find a new pasture for the only no-cover, no-minimum, country-western basement nightclub in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. An office skyscraper is planned for the site where the Sundowners trio entertains the crowd, and 30 varieties of chili are served to the folks who stroll in off <LOCATION> Randolph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. The movie theater next door has already been closed, but the Ranch is still filled with the sounds of guitar picking _ for a few more weeks. If the owners ca n't find a new location before the wrecking ball strikes, the Sundowners will have to find a new place to hang their white Stetsons, and night owls will no longer be able to find a $ 3.15 `` chili mac tamale cheese salami bowl'' at 3 a.m. However, co-owner <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is optimistic he'll find a place for the Ranch, which has been at its current location since 1978. `` Both of its previous sites got torn down, too,'' he said Wednesday. `` They tell us we've got three or four weeks, maybe a bit longer,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at various sites in the downtown area. Most of the nightlife seems to be moving to <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, but I do n't think <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> is for us.'' <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, a fashionable neighborhood with loft condominiums and art deco restaurants, might not be the best place for a club that has a barbed wire collection behind the bar and `` Bulls'' and `` Heifers'' signs on the restrooms. River North's nouvelle sensibilities also might be offended by the Ranch's menu, which features items such as the `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steak </PERSON> -LRB- A Steal! -RRB-,'' and the occasional ornery patron. When the music's going good and the club is near its 200-patron capacity, the cook, who calls himself `` <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,'' sometimes has to double as waiter and calmer of the crowd. `` When the parties get a little wild, you might find someone who wants to pull a little strip show, and I've got to stop them,'' he explained. For singer and guitarist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, 57, the Ranch has been home since he left <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, 35 years ago. `` Don -LRB- Walls -RRB-, <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> -RRB- and I have been the Sundowners most of our adult lives,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. `` We do about seven sets on a good night, mixing in a little blues and a little pop with a lot of C & amp; W. `` We keep four big books with a few thousand songs in them up by the bandstand in case we get an odd request _ the tunes are usually no problem, but you can forget the words. `` Mostly, though, the old songs wear the best. Over the years, we've had the most requests for <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>'s version of ` The Wabash Cannonball' and old <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>' ` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rose </LOCATION>.''' The Sundowners are the only act advertised on the Ranch's street-level sign, but other entertainers have been known to walk down the steps and sit in for a set or two <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> are among those who have dropped in over the years. `` We know most of their songs,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, being at it as long as we have, we know most of everybody's songs. When we do n't know a song _ then that's what I'd call an odd request.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stocks Unchanged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell today against the Japanese yen, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index closed unchanged from the previous day. The dollar, which had gained 1.25 yen on Wednesday, fell back by 0.83 yen today, closing at 126.12 yen. It opened today at 125.90 yen, and ranged between 125.90 and 126.22 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's sharply lower opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed concerted dollar-selling intervention by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central banks on overseas markets overnight, dealers said. Central banks in several <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> intervened in exchange markets Wednesday to brake the dollar's recent rise against their currencies. But news of the intervention did not sharply discourage dollar-buying in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, as market players expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary authorities to keep high interest rates, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. `` But the current dollar-buying trend will slow down as next week's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monthly trade report approaches,'' the dealer added. Another dealer at a major commercial bank said that as long as investors do not anticipate a rapid decline in the dollar, their strong appetite for the currency will continue. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which climbed 136.94 points Wednesday to a record high close of 31,143.45, finished at the same level today. In the afternoon session, the index regained the 86.50 points lost in morning trading. Dealers said speculative investors' buying interest, targeted on steel issues Thursday afternoon, helped the market's main barometer to recover. Trading was active, with volume traded on the first section estimated at 1.2 billion shares.

 A man who spent 20 years trying to leave <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> unwittingly deported himself and his family from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for what he thought would be a 20 minute excursion to the Canadian side of <LOCATION> Niagra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. Three weeks after they left their <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> home on the trip, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, his wife and two adopted children remain stranded in motel in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. They set out Dec. 20 on a Christmas quest for snow, which his adopted children, <PERSON> Yoandys </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Yordalys </PERSON>, 9, had never seen. Even though the family lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for four years, immigration officials will not allow them back because they are illegal aliens. `` We came for 20 minutes,'' <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> said. `` No one told us we could not go back.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., has joined the Fajardos' cause by asking officials to let the family back `` This family has strong ties to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> community through relatives, business and local school attendance,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said in a letter to Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` It would be comforting to these people for them to be able to resume their well-established lives.'' <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, 39, a small, soft-spoken man who tried for two decades to leave his native <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said the family drove 1,500 miles in their truck to <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where they checked into a motel and planned to visit <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He told Canadian border guards his family wanted to see the Horseshoe Falls. When the family returned, however, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border guards demanded to proof of their citizenship. All <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> had was a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> driver's license At first, <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> maintained he was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. Later, he said he was a resident alien. But immigration officials, after a search of their records, determined otherwise. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Bermaida </PERSON>, and her two children entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in 1985 and <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> entered the country illegally in 1986. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> denies entering the country illegally. An immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to Mrs. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> and the two children. She appealed the decision in August on grounds that she would face persecution if returned to communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, but her appeal was rejected. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s application for asylum was pending when he crossed the border. His status was officially nullified by leaving the country, <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> could reapply, but his wife and children can not because they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration officials, <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` The family lied and their credibility is about zero at this point,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. Canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> until Sunday. What happens to them after that is uncertain. Under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> agreed not to return to his homeland. He said he left the country in 1984 with only the clothes on his back. He achieved relative prosperity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> working in several jobs, including his current one as a boat builder, and said he owns a home in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Students Protest Proposed Teachers Wage Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 10,000 students, most of them high-school age or younger, marched on the Education Ministry to protest a proposed cut in teachers' pay. Some schools let their students off for the mile-long march, Others counted participation as a classroom exercise in social science courses. Some students simply cut classes to be there. `` Who Will Rule Sweden In 20 Years, Educated People or Uneducated'' said one placard. The rally came a day after Finance Minister <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> presented a budget bill to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that trimmed $ 27 million, or about 0.5 percent, off teachers' wages. <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> said teachers' salaries went up last year by more than the 5.6 percent limit set by Parliament. The cut was condemned by all five opposition parties, which threaten to unite to kill the measure. Critics say schools are run down, textbooks tattered and torn, qualified teachers too few and meals in the free school canteens are tasteless. Primary school teachers earn up to $ 2,000 a month, while the best-qualified secondary-school teachers earn up to $ 2,270 a month after 15 years in the profession.

 A woman accused of drowning her 2-month-old son, dismembering his body and dumping the remains in two creeks reportedly told police she could n't cope `` because he was always crying,'' authorities said. <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>, 20, and her husband, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>, were being held today pending an arraignment, authorities said. Police divers searching murky <LOCATION> Neshaminy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Croydon </LOCATION> on Wednesday found five green plastic bags containing <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>'s head, hands and feet, said police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON>. A search for the torso in <LOCATION> Pohopoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Carbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 80 miles to the northwest was called off at dusk, <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said. The search was to resume today. Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> is charged with murder, false reports, hindering apprehension, tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice and conspiracy in tampering with a corpse, police said. If convicted, she could be sentenced to death. Her husband is charged with obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, aiding in a crime and conspiracy in tampering with a corpse, police said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 22 years in prison, Assistant District <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said police believe <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON>, 22, did not kill his son but helped dispose of the body. Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> initially told police her baby was kidnapped at a mall Tuesday, authorities said. She later told investigators she drowned <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> in a bathtub Saturday, cut the corpse up with a knife Sunday and stuffed the remains into plastic trash bags, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported today, quoting unidentified police sources. Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> said that she and her husband drove to bridges crossing the creeks and threw the bags in, the sources said. She took officers to both locations to show them where to search, the sources said. Police searching a trash container outside the Dacris' apartment building in northeast <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> found a knife believed to have been the one used to dismember <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON>, the newspaper said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> told police she had tried to cope with raising her son and year-old daughter, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, but could n't `` because he was always crying,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said. The daughter has been placed with a grandparent, police said. A homicide detective declined to comment on the newspaper report early today, saying no supervisor with the authorization to release such information was on duty. Police became suspicious shortly after Mrs. <PERSON> Dacri </PERSON> reported that two men grabbed <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> and her purse at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> shopping mall Tuesday, said police Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLise </PERSON>. She told police the kidnappers drove off in a sedan with no license plate and a third person behind the wheel, and said there were no witnesses in what is normally a busy area. Police said the <PERSON> Dacris </PERSON> lost custody of <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> for eight months last year following allegations of child abuse. They underwent counseling before the child was returned to them in September, authorities said.

<HEAD>Doctor Group Proposes Government-Run Health Insurance For All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should abolish private health insurance and instead provide Canadian-style government coverage for everyone, a group representing 1,200 doctors proposed today. `` Our health care system is failing,'' the group wrote. `` It denies access to many in need and is expensive, inefficient and increasingly bureaucratic.'' They suggested a system modeled on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national health program that they said would cost no more than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' current mix of public and private coverage `` Every year, as the costs of the current system go up and up and the number of uninsured people go up and up, that will be a push toward this fundamental change in our system,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON>. The proposal was drawn up by the 1,200-member Physicians for a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The group's 30-member writing committee was chaired by Dr. <PERSON> Steffie </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolandler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON>. The two doctors, based at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, recently published `` a Marxist view of current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health policy,'' which also praised the Canadian system. `` There are people of all political stripes involved in writing this, from the right to the left wing,'' <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I am clearly one of the left-wing people.'' A second paper in the journal, written by <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Enthoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, proposed a less drastic plan for universal health insurance. Their program would retain private insurance but require employers to provide coverage for their workers. Those not covered at work would contribute through taxes, and poor people's coverage would be totally subsidized by the government. These authors argued that a complete government takeover of health care financing `` would represent far too radical a change to be politically feasible in this country.'' Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Relman </PERSON>, the journal's editor, wrote in an editorial that the `` time has come'' for universal health insurance, but he did not endorse either plan. <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woolhandler </PERSON> argued that `` a single comprehensive program is necessary both to ensure equal access to care and to minimize the complexity and expense of billing and administration.'' Funding for their program would be based on an income tax `` or other progressive tax.'' The authors said the cost of extra service would be offset by lower administrative overhead, making the total cost no more than the current system.

 <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s former homosexual lover said the actor began losing weight and having night sweats in June 1984, but it was n't until a year later that he learned <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was stricken with AIDS. `` I was sitting alone in Rock's home. I turned on the television set: ` <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had acquired immune deficiency syndrome,''' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury Wednesday in his $ 11 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate. `` I began to sweat. I blacked out. I thought, ` Oh my God. I'm a dead man.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, asked him why he thought he would die. `` Because I had very intimate sexual contact with <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> -LRB- and -RRB- he had full-blown AIDS,'' Christian replied. Christian, 35, an aspiring musician, is suing the actor's estate and former secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, alleging they did n't tell him <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, who said he does not have the sexually transmitted disease that killed <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> in 1985, denied defense assertions that he was publicity-seeking opportunist who filed the lawsuit after he learned <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> did not include him in his will. Christian, under questioning by <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, said he had no idea whether he was included in the will. The lawsuit also contends Christian should receive compensation for emotional distress and fear that he had been infected with the deadly disease. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> developed a sore on his neck in June 1984, which <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told him was caused by the sun, and was losing weight. `` His skin became very dry. He had scales. He was itching a lot. He had skin rashes. He began to sweat at night,'' Christian testified. Although he questioned <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> about the symptoms, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told him he either was dieting, had the flu or gallstone problems, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told him the actor was anorexic, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and continued to have unprotected sexual intercourse with him until February 1985, when <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> lost interest in sex. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he has been celibate since then. It was n't until he heard a July 1985 television news broadcast that <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> had AIDS that <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> learned his lover had the fatal disease, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> called him from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had collapsed, to see how he was taking the news. According to <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told him to `` do anything you can for the kid, I may have killed him.''

<HEAD>Up To 30 Political Prisoners Held In Hospitals, Activists Claim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As many as 30 political prisoners are being held in psychiatric hospitals despite claims by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> no longer has political detainees, activists say. The Soviet leader told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last month that `` no persons convicted for their political or religious beliefs in places of confinement'' are being held in his country. But the activists told a news conference in a cramped apartment the names of three people they say are political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals. Two other men at Wednesday's news conference said they were former political prisoners and have been released in the past six months. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has credited the Soviets with `` significant progress'' in its treatment of political prisoners, saying it has freed all those held under laws limiting expressions of political and religious beliefs. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official has said it still has questions about 30 prisoners who are considered criminal violators by the Soviets. A delegation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> psychiatrists is expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late February to visit alleged political prisoners being held in psychiatric hospitals, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>. He said the group expects to see about 20 patients. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, 27, who said he was hospitalized as a schizophrenic after distributing `` leaflets on democratic rights,'' said he personally met seven other political prisoners at the <LOCATION> Chernitovskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, where he was held until October. He said none seemed mentally disturbed to him. Through them, he said he learned of 20 political prisoners at that institution alone. `` The doctors are sadists,'' said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, whose complexion was still white from his years of confinement. `` These hospitals do n't have a medical function, they have a criminal, punishment function. `` And this is in the time of glasnost, perestroika and democratization, in the time of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' said activist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON>. Last year, Soviet officials announced that a new law made it illegal to commit a patently healthy person to a psychiatric institution. <PERSON> Valeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON>, who served several years in the <LOCATION> Perm </LOCATION> labor camp for anti-Soviet propaganda, said `` hundreds of people are still sitting in custody for political reasons.'' <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said they believe 20 to 30 political prisoners remain in the psychiatric hospitals, but he knows the names of only a few. The most recent to be imprisoned is <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchenko </PERSON>, sent to a psychiatric hospital Dec. 23 in <LOCATION> Nikolaev </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Ilchenko </PERSON> was working with a human rights group in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> when he was called into a hospital allegedly to discuss his pension benefits on Dec. 23, <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said. `` The doctor demanded the names of people he'd been meeting in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, and said he was engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda,'' <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ilchenko </PERSON> was placed in a psychiatric institution, injected with drugs, and remains there today, <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ilchenko </PERSON> had been forced into a psychiatric hospital once before, where electric shock treatments `` left him in terrible condition,'' said <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON>, who is a medical assistant by profession. Others political prisoners still held are <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON>, who has been imprisoned for more than a decade, and <PERSON> Vyatislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherkassian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cherkassian </LOCATION> is a member of Pamyat, a right-wing extremist organization that blames the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s problems on Jews, foreigners and Freemasons. <PERSON> Podrabinik </PERSON> said he had no wish to stand up for the organization, but added, `` It is wrong that someone should be hospitalized even for chauvinist ideas.'' `` There have been cases where people were quite normal, and they were turned into psychiatric cases by the pressure'' of the forced treatment, <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhinya </PERSON> said he was placed in a psychiatric hospital for two years for publishing a philosophy manuscript in the underground press. The 50-year-old man from the <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> region said he was transferred last summer from the mental institution to a regular hospital, and released in October.

 Thousands of copies of a fake front page of The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> declaring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were placed in the newspaper's vending machines throughout <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, authorities said. Police were investigating Wednesday's hoax, and Executive Editor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Auslander </PERSON> said the morning newspaper would pursue a civil complaint alleging copyright violation against anyone caught. Charges of misdemeanor theft of service and trespassing could be brought against anyone involved, said police Lt. <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. The mock front page contained a headline reading, `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> at war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> _ 70,000 killed.'' Another headline stating, `` Rebels seize initiative in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' ran above stories condemning <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies toward the Central American country. The mockup used type faces and design resembling those of the Star, but the phony front page was only about two-thirds the size of the real one. No group was mentioned in the stories and no one called the Star to claim responsibility, said Managing Editor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` The content is a clear political bias,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said of the phony stories. `` The ironic thing to me is that of the papers they could have chosen in the state of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, they happened to choose the one paper which consistently does editorialize against ... the administration's policies in Central and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, circulation director for the publishing company jointly owned by the parent companies of the Star and the evening <ORGANIZATION> Tucson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 bogus copies were placed in as many as 600 Star vending machines. The Star has a daily circulation of about 87,000. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the fakes were inserted in the machines after 5 a.m., when newspaper employees finish delivering copies to the 1,150 machines in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. `` We found them in machines virtually all over the city,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. He said some of the mockups were placed in stacks atop the real newspapers and others were placed between individual newspapers.

<TEXT>
 The commander of next month's planned shuttle mission says he is confident the flight will prove that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s manned space flight program is back on schedule and here to stay `` We're quite proud to be flying the third flight since the -LRB- Challenger -RRB- accident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> said during the final preflight news conference Wednesday. `` We're very anxious to show that we're back in space on a routine, regular basis.'' Flying with Coats will be pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> flew aboard Discovery in January 1983 and is the only other shuttle veteran on the five-day mission scheduled to begin Feb. 23. The mission, Coats said, will initiate a busy year in which seven shuttle flights are planned, including the first two designed to dispatch probes to the planets _ <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> in April and <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> to Jupiter in October. Discovery also flew on a mission last fall that was the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s first since the Challenger explosion of January 1986. The shuttle Atlantis was the next to fly. It returned last month from a secret <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> flight with severe damage to about 200 of the 28,000 tiles that protect it from re-entry heat. It was the worst tile damage ever sustained by a shuttle. Two small cracks also were found in a bearing unit within a high-pressure engine turbopump during a post-flight inspection. But Coats, who flew aboard Discovery in August 1984, said Wednesday he is certain both problems will be resolved in time to meet the February launch. `` The engine problem is probably unique to that engine,'' Coats said, adding that engineers are looking at Discovery's engines and have spare turbopumps available. Engineers believe the cracks were caused by moisture that somehow penetrated the housing around the bearing. Coats said it appeared that <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' tiles were damaged during liftoff by insulation falling off the nose cone of one of the solid fuel booster rockets. `` But we're also reassured because despite all the damage Atlantis' tiles took, it survived,'' he said. `` I have a lot of confidence the tiles will see us home just fine.'' Discovery's main objective is to deploy a sophisticated tracking and data relay satellite. It completes a network that will allow ground controllers to communicate with shuttle astronauts and other unmanned satellites. Several scientific and medical experiments also will be conducted during the mission, and the crew will use a powerful IMAX camera to photograph damage to the planet caused by nature and man. Volcanoes in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, deforestation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> desert in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and global beach erosion are among the subjects to be photographed. Among the experiments planned are two student projects, including one in which four rats will be used to determine how injured bones heal in the weightlessness of space. `` The bone reparation process is an interesting question that has to be answered before man takes extended space flights,'' said <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>, a medical doctor who will observe the rats in orbit.

<TEXT>
 The City Commission has voted to seek dismissal of a theft charge against its former city manager because he faces a stiffer charge in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for using a bogus resume to get a municipal job, officials said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R.T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is accused of using false resumes to apply for city government jobs in four states, was arrested in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Dec. 20 on a theft-by-deception charge filed in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, 34, was fired the next day as city administrator in <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a job he had held since October. The <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, native was charged last week with first-degree theft for allegedly using a false resume to obtain $ 28,000 in salary, moving, travel and other work-related expenses from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town `` He's going to have some problems up there,'' <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They've already got him.'' Justice said the more serious charge in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the estimated $ 30,000 cost of extradition persuaded the commission to unanimously seek to drop the charge. A formal dismissal of the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> charge was expected in a few days, authorities said. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> resigned the <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> job in August after only six days when reporters uncovered several apparently false entries on his resume. He was indicted in October for allegedly failing to return $ 697 in travel reimbursements. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, who is jailed in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, in lieu of $ 10,000 bond, has called the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> theft charge `` preposterous'' and said he would have returned the money in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> had he been asked. The <ORGANIZATION> Kake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> based on glowing recommendations from references on his impressive, four-page resume. The resume listed master's and bachelor's degrees in public administration from <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, officials said. He also listed experience as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Officials say there is no record that <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> attended the university or worked for the associations.

 A judge granted asylum-seeking Central Americans another three weeks to leave south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, bringing sighs of relief for some of the hundreds trapped in desperate conditions by an immigration policy. `` Now we can go and be a little more tranquil about when we leave,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON> said he hoped to leave for a cousin's home in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Filemon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> on Wednesday postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week against the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The hearing had been scheduled for today, when a temporary restraining order <PERSON> Vela </PERSON> issued Monday against an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy was to expire. The order restored asylum-seekers' right to travel to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations while their cases are resolved. They retain that right until the rescheduled hearing. `` It will help some,'' said City Manager <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbons </PERSON>, adding that the crisis is not over for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' southernmost city. `` We have unofficial reports that there are 20,000 to 50,000 people still in the pipeline, on their way here,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is operating four shelters for Central Americans at churches, and <PERSON> Fitzgibbons </PERSON> said they should be replaced by a single, large center such as the local National Guard armory. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> policy put into effect Dec. 16 required that asylum seekers stay close to the application center nearest their point of entry while their requests are considered. Asylum seekers unable to leave the area because of the policy resorted to living in primitive camps, abandoned buildings and church shelters. Many Central Americans enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and file their requests at the busy <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Monday's order sparked an exodus, and hundreds of asylum seekers swamped the <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> center to ensure their applications would be processed by Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office processed 967 asylum applications Tuesday, a one-day record, and 739 Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said the agency had asked the judge to postpone the hearing so it could prepare its defense. `` We will be ready to go'' by Jan. 31, she said. `` And we are going to fight it all the way.'' She said about 95 percent of the applicants `` are here for jobs, not political asylum.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an attorney with the Harlingen-based Projecto Libertad legal office and a co-counsel to the class-action lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, said the asylum seekers are ready for trial but welcome the extended travel time. `` This should remedy the huge backlog of thousands of people stuck in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> -RRB- valley, so I think we'll see a lot less of the hardship and the crisis that we've seen in the past three weeks,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. Bus companies added extra northbound runs Tuesday and Wednesday, including a Greyhound Lines bus added Tuesday evening in which `` the whole busload was going to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON>, a Greyhound spokesman in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Those remaining in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> continued to receive donations of food and clothing from the community. `` Whether you agree with everything that's been happening, or if they're illegals, they're still hungry,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who with members of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> dished out beans and tortillas to Central Americans gathered at the INS office. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> city officials Wednesday took more than 100 Central Americans out of squalid conditions at the condemned Amber Motel and bused them to church shelters.

<TEXT>
 The head of an <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> shipping company has been arrested in connection with the building of Libyan plant the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims is a chemical arms factory, a justice source said today. The source said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, director <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION>, has been charged with forging shipping documents. He is to be arraigned Monday. `` We have found that there are grounds for prosecution,'' said the source, who asked not to be named and declined to elaborate. Gedopt is charged with altering documents for the shipment by sea of construction materials to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that were allegedly used to build the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. His arrest is part of a windening international probe into the nature of the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant and the role played by West German and other companies in its construction. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> denies the plant can make chemical weapons, saying it was built to produce pharmaceuticals. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged that five West German companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build the plant, notably Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> and I.B.I. Engineering of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON> was taken in for questioning Wednesday on his arrival at the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> airport from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and formally arrested Wednesday night. According to news reports in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he allegedly alterted documents to hide the nature and destination of cargo he shipped from Imhausen-Chemie to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. One shipment, in February, 1986, on the <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, a Cypriot-registered freighter, listed <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> as the final destination but the freighter unloaded its cargo at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>'s arrest came just days after officials of the investigation section of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s customs service visited <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to run the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> once endangered a South Korean spy's life by telling a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> official about the man's plan to defect, a newspaper reported today <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> admitted telling a South Korean diplomat in a 1977 telephone call that the spy wanted to defect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unpublished records of a 1983 congressional hearing. Before the hearing, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> had publicly denied making such a call. The incident occurred during the `` Koreagate'' scandal involving influence buying on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the Times said. The spy, high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, wanted to defect because he was about to be transferred home from a post in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials wanted to interview him regarding his government's involvement in the scandal. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrived at <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> home and escorted him to safety only 30 minutes before <ORGANIZATION> KCIA </ORGANIZATION> agents showed up, an unidentified senior law enforcement official told the Times. `` This guy, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> defector, would have been severely punished or killed, as well as his family,'' the official said. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who served 24 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, publicly denied 1978 allegations that he leaked the information and refused to testify in the matter before a federal grand jury and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics Committee. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience includes nearly six years at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, refused to discuss the incident this week, the Times said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspaperman aiding <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> during the transition, described the incident as `` an 11-year-old story, a non-event.'' `` He was not charged with any illegal or unethical conduct,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` That's the operative comment.'' <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s involvement in the episode and his early lack of candor will be investigated during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings on his nomination to head the new <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Veterans Affairs <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office, said, `` Any questions that arise will be answered by Mr. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> at his confirmation hearings.'' The Times said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials learned of the leak and were able to move <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> because they recorded <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s September 1977 phone call to the South Korean embassy. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> was the ranking Republican on the the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on international relations, which had secretly been in touch with <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> and planned to have him testify about the <ORGANIZATION> KCIA </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in Koreagate, the Times said. Information about <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>'s plan to defect was so sensitive that former Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, D-Minn., then-chairman of the subcommittee, told only <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, the newspaper said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, now an undersecretary of state, belatedly admitted in 1983 that he leaked the information, the Times said. The admission came in a closed meeting with senators just before he was confirmed to his first <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post in 1983. A transcript of the hearing, which was never printed or published by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but was found in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, shows that Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, insisted on putting what <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told the panel into the public record. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s telephoned tip to the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was `` an error in judgment,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>West Germany Hit By Sharp Rise In Drug-Related Deaths, U.N. Report
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 International drug traffickers are moving increasing quantities of illegal narcotics, threatening governments' stability and contributing to a sharp rise in drug-related deaths, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said today The 1988 annual report by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which last year warned that drug trafficking groups in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> challenged state authorities, did not single out any region for particular blame. `` Illicit production and manufacture of drugs take place in a growing number of countries,'' the 31-page report says. `` These activities continue to be carried out by criminal organizations ... which often join forces with terrorist groups, spread violence and corruption, threaten political institutions, undermine the integrity of national economies and imperil the very security of countries,'' it said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the report said the estimated quantities of illicit drugs entering the country continued to rise, especially cocaine. One bright spot cited in the report was a 1987 survey of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high school and college students that indicated drug-abuse declining among that group. The survey found for the first time a 20 percent decrease in cocaine use by high school and college students and young adults. The Vienna-based board works with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies. It said its report was based on data from governments, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> and other international organizations. Many countries provide information voluntarily. However, the report said that of the world's 185 countries and territories, only 10 _ <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> _ declined to provide drug-related data. `` During 1988, the gravity of the situation, which preoccupies the highest levels of governments, has led to strong counterattacks'' by governments, the report says. It singled out a coordinated enforcement operation in August that featured 30 countries in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The effort led to the seizure of 12 tons of cocaine, dismantling of 13 cocaine laboratories, destruction of seven clandestine airstrips and arrest of at least 1,000 people, the report says. In another development, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference last month ended a four-year fight against illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse, adopting a document giving all signatory countries the right to extradite suspected drug traffickers and the right to confiscate all their assets. But observers say the document, signed by 43 countries, may take years to become legally binding. The report says drug-related deaths increased sharply during 1987 and the first three months of 1988, with heroin the main killer. It singled out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where 1,362 people died during that period, compared with 606 who died in 1986 and the first three months of 1987. The report also noted: _ Opium production in southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> remains high despite campaigns to eradicate opium poppy cultivation. Abundant opium, together with the availability of essential chemicals, facilitate heroin production in clandestine laboratories near the borders of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. _ Transit trafficking of opium and heroin was reported to continue unabated in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, despite vigorous law enforcement backed by severe penalties. _ In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, health and law enforcement authorities have expanded activities aimed at eliminating the abuse of certain drugs and mind-altering substances. Stricter laws have been enacted to prosecute traffickers, and serious drug offenses can draw up to 10 years in jail.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts Call Reduced Award in Molestation a Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A jury ordered the local scouting council to pay $ 45,000 to a youth because he was sexually molested by his former scoutmaster but rejected the boy's $ 10 million claim against the national Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Boy Scouts called the decision a vindication of their treatment of the complaint and of the scouts' supervision of local councils that hire scoutmasters. The <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury had deliberated for five days after a six-week trial before deciding Wednesday that former scoutmaster <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON>, a convicted pedophile, had molested the youth. Jurors agreed with scout attorneys, however, that the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area council was liable for selecting <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON>. The youth, identified in court papers as `` Infant C,'' is now 17 and claimed he was molested by <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON> over a 10-month period in 1984. The youth's lawyers claimed the scouts were negligent in choosing <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON> to lead Troop 1970 because he had pleaded guilty to a molestation charge while a scoutmaster in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> three years before. The introduced confidential scout files hoping to prove that the organization would n't act against pedophiles within its ranks because of the fear of bad publicity. `` We're very pleased with the outcome,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebb </PERSON>, director of public relations for the national Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The evidence at the trial clearly demonstrated that scouting is a local activity and that parents, neighbors and fellow members are the people best suited to select scouting membership,'' <PERSON> Hebb </PERSON> said in a statement. The youth's lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessel </PERSON>, called the damages award `` grossly inadequate'' and said he will ask presiding Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamborsky </PERSON> to overrule the jury's decision at a hearing Jan. 27. The damages does not cover the $ 58,907 in medical expenses the youth has incurred, according to testimony presented at the trial. `` How this boy could have suffered $ 45,000 worth of damages, I simply do n't understand. ... This boy deserves better than this,'' he said. The teen and his family initially sought $ 30 million from the scouts and <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON>. But the amount was reduced during the trial to $ 10 million and the judge dismissed <PERSON> Bittenbender </PERSON> from the suit, ruling the man's actions were intentional and so not negligent.

 A West German convicted of illegally arranging the shipment of a solvent used in chemical warfare from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> forfeited his $ 350,000 bond and fled the country, The Sun reported today. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, a representative of a German chemical company, did not return Dec. 1 to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> halfway house, where he was ordered to live while awaiting sentencing, the newspaper said, citing court papers. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> left the house that day for a volunteer job, and never returned. The next day, he called his American attorney and told him he was in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the documents said. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> did not appear for his scheduled sentencing Dec. 20. At the request of federal prosecutors Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who presided over the case, ordered the forfeiture of $ 100,000 in cash <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> posted on the $ 350,000 bond and the seizure of an additional $ 250,000 he had on deposit in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bank. Federal officials refused to comment on what was being done to retrieve Walschek from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and on whether anyone else was under investigation, the Sun said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a suspected chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceppos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, declined to comment Wednesday, citing his client's request he not discuss the matter. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, who faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine, was arrested Aug. 1 on a charge he arranged the shipment of thiodiglycol from <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. He None of those countries is allowed to receive the chemical without first obtaining special permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, according to court records in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The export of thiodiglycol is restricted because it can be used to manufacture mustard gas, a deadly poison first used during World War I. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were accused of using chemical weapons during their eight-year war. On Aug. 26, <LOCATION> Walschek </LOCATION>, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> Chemco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gmbh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to one count of illegally shipping thiodiglycol to non-approved countries, and was sent to the halfway house. <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it had been erroneously informed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that no special permission was required for shipments of thiodiglycol to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The company said `` it had no knowledge of the alleged effort to divert the chemical from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, had voluntarily taken precautions to guard against this sort of thing and had relied upon assurances from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies that the company was complying with regulations.'' That assertion, however, was contradicted in a 14-page affidavit detailing the scheme which the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> filed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in September.

 A plan to clean this city's notoriously filthy air by planting millions of trees and curtailing driving could help counter the greenhouse effect if copied by other urban areas, an environmentalist said. `` If we're going to address this problem it will be a grass-roots effort by activists throughout the cities of the world,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trends </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of environmental activists in 35 countries. In response to federal pressure to reduce smog and local anxiety about growth and traffic congestion, Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> recently proposed planting 2 million to 5 million trees throughout the city during the next five years, encouraging the use of public transport and ride-sharing, and weaning industries away from fossil fuels that generate high levels of carbon dioxide. The 63-point proposal represents the first urban effort to curb the worldwide greenhouse effect, said <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, who joined the mayor at a City Hall news conference Wednesday. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said he would ask mayors of cities throughout the world to emulate the plan. `` This landmark project, initiated in a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> metropolis, will focus on the urban areas throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. `` It is vital for the future of the planet that we begin to sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect.'' The greenhouse effect is a term used by scientists to describe a potential warming of the Earth's temperature by pollution and carbon dioxide that trap solar radiation in the atmosphere. Many scientists fear it could cause the planet's temperature to raise several degrees, melting polar ice, raising sea levels and flooding coastal cities and possibly disrupting agriculture. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said the most dramatic element of the plan is the proposed planting of trees, which absorb carbon dioxide and produce life-giving oxygen. `` Up to 5 million trees planted in the right places in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will conserve the energy equivalent of one to two new power plants,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipkis </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> TreePeople </ORGANIZATION>, a conservation and community-action group that is organizing the planting campaign. The city has donated $ 25,000 of an estimated $ 100,000 needed to organize the planting, which probably will cost several million dollars, <PERSON> Lipkis </PERSON> said. Among the specific recommendations of the plan, which <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> unveiled Jan. 4, are mandatory parking fees at shopping malls, replacing the city's cars and trucks with newer models that get better mileage and establishing tax incentives for home energy conservation.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today rocketed bases of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> outside this southern port for the second time in 13 hours and police reported an undetermined number of casualties. Two Israeli jets roared in at 10:05 a.m. to attack camps belonging to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Majdalyoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, four miles east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Israeli military authorities said the bases served as a planning and staging areas for terrorist attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> splinter group, has been blamed for terrorist attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Western European countries, most notably the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airport massacres of December 1985. A police spokesman said the two Israeli jets in today's raid fired four rockets `` in a few seconds and flew away west toward the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.'' The spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said smoke billowed from the valley. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas at first turned away ambulances dispatched from <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, claiming there were no casualties. But the police spokesman said the ambulances later were allowed into <LOCATION> Majdalyoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and returned with sirens wailing. He said they took an undisclosed number of casualties to a <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> clinic in the Druse-controlled <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains northeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. `` These people -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are clever in hiding their losses. It is very difficult to estimate their casualties,'' the spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas opened up at the raiding jets from twin-barreled anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed, he said. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army said in a statement that the bombing followed an earlier raid at 9 p.m. Wednesday. It did not say if the target was destroyed, but said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes had returned safely from both raids. The attacks were the first two Israeli air raids on guerrilla targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. According to a police count, 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 Israeli air raids on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1988. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, broke away from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group in 1974 and formed his faction two years later. He is the most wanted Palestinian terrorist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> opposes <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s explicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> today urged Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to agree to an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and said he wo n't visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until that happens. `` All countries of the world except <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' have accepted such an international conference as the proper framework for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. A conference, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, would bring together concerned parties and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> say the conference should lead to direct Arab-Israeli talks. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> discussed the conference and other matters at a news conference following a private meeting with Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other regional problems when he visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Mubarek </PERSON> did n't say when he will go, but political adviser <LOCATION> Osama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Baz </LOCATION> says the visit is expected in the first half of this year. `` I have known <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president. We used to exchange views on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> problems,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` We understand each other well.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has repeatedly rejected a peace conference, believing that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be forced to make territorial concessions by countries who are biased against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I believe world opinion fully agrees to an international conference and I appeal to Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to respond to the voice of peace that is backed by world opinion,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. Asked about prospects of his visiting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> replied: `` I have said it repeatedly before, and I sent a message accordingly to Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>: if my visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will lead to good progress in -LRB- solving -RRB- the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> problem, then I am ready to go. `` I can not visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> particularly after Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> announced he will not make territorial concessions and does not accept an international peace conference. He is not giving something in return or -LRB- paying -RRB- a price for my visit, and we will not go there to have tea and coffee or to have a good time.'' A visit `` must achieve something tangible'' in furthering efforts for an <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> settlement, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has refused to relinquish any <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territory his forces presently occupy: the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, all seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signed a peace treaty in 1979 and established diplomatic relations, but <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has not visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since taking office in 1981.

<TEXT>
 A long-dormant geological fault discovered under the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons complex will not affect the restart of the site's three reactors, says a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> official. `` We see nothing right now that would make any difference,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who directs DOE environmental studies at the SRP. The department and the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the facility, on Wednesday announced the discovery of the fault, a fracture or zone of fractures in rock strata where pressure and displacement can cause earthquakes. Geologists believe that the fault _ the most significant ever found at the complex _ is no longer active and that its last movement probably occurred about 30 million years ago, the department said. The Pen Branch Fault runs within a half-mile of the K-Reactor, which the department hopes will be the first restarted this year after repairs, and the site of a reactor that is expected to be built beginning in 1991 or 1992, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. The two other reactors are several miles from the fault, he said. All three reactors have been shut down since August because of safety concerns, and the idling of the nation's only active tritium-producing reactors has made the Pentagon concerned about the supply of tritium, which is used in bombs. The radioactive material decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, which means that it must be replenished periodically. A geology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> said the fault, which is about 300 meters deep at its lowest point, is n't likely to produce an earthquake of any significance `` These are extremely shallow faults,'' said <PERSON> Pradeep </PERSON> <PERSON> Talwani </PERSON>. `` -LRB- They -RRB- just do n't have the energy to have a large earthquake.'' In 1886, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> flattened much of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, more than 100 miles to the east. The fault extends across the site in a northeast-southwest direction for about 20 miles and is probably part of a set of other faults that run parallel with it, geologists said. It runs almost parallel to a previously known fault. Scientists plan to drill more wells and excavate trenches to learn more about the fault, including its history and magnitude. The preliminary report will be submitted to the Bulletin of the <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> for publication later this year, following peer review. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that preliminary findings are seldom released before peer and official reviews but that DOE and <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> realized the public has a strong interest in discovery `` regardless of whether -LRB- the fault -RRB- is active or not.'' A full study by an <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take two to three years. The panel includes experts from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey, <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors pressured <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime prime minister, Gen. <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>, into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in war crimes, a television documentary claims. The British <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid putting <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> on trial. The documentary challenges <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among other things that he: _ Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> front _ Knew more than a month in advance of Japanese plans to attack the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> navy at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, 1941 The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> will show `` Hirohito _ Behind the Myth'' on Jan. 24. <PERSON> Behr </PERSON> is a Paris-based journalist. His biography of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last monarch was used for the award-winning film `` The Last Emperor.'' It has been reported previously that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prosecutors wanted to keep <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> out of the war crimes trial and asked <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON> to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the High Command. Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces occupying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, wrote in his book `` Reminiscences'' that he fended off pressure from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to indict <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war. <PERSON> Behr </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview Wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> on March 13.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says it will try to maintain its minuscule AIDS rate by screening foreigners for the deadly virus, even forcing mandatory tests of some visitors who can not provide proper medical proof. Foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months or more will be subject to testing for the disease beginning next month, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` Here, there can not be any discrimination,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` We conduct tests of our own people and besides, statistics show the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is sharply lagging behind other countries, say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in the number of ill people -LRB- with AIDS -RRB-. And we just do n't want to catch up.'' The Soviets once regarded AIDS as a disease spawned by Western sexual depravity and drug use. One Soviet newspaper's account had even claimed the virus was the result of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> biological warfare experiment gone haywire. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the regulations were introduced to supplement a 1987 decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers. That decree made it a crime to knowingly spread AIDS, punishable by up to eight years' imprisonment, and said anyone in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could be forced to take a test to determine whether they were carriers. According to <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the new rules go into effect Feb. 1. Summarizing them at a news briefing Wednesday, he said: `` Foreigners coming into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for over three months, if they do n't have certificates which would be mutually accepted by agreement, should be screened. As outlined by <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the new regulations on testing for AIDS antibodies appear to exempt short-term tourists but to apply to all foreigners _ diplomats, students, business people and journalists _ who live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. As of late 1988, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, AIDS testsof 17 million people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had turned up 112 Soviets who carry the virus, as opposed to 334 foreigners residing in the country. Eight people have the disease, five foreigners and three Soviets, he said. `` We do not want this kind of import,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to say foreigners are a risk group But we do n't take any chances.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said a traveler who tests AIDS-positive may be asked to leave the country. `` People who try to avoid medical examination or treatment may be expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, following a prosecutor's sanction,'' he said. Soviet doctors customarily use hypodermic needles that are then boiled to sterilize them for re-use, but <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told one inquiring foreign reporter: `` Do n't worry, we'll do our best so that you will have single-use needles.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vice consul in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s announcement was the first indication he'd had from Soviet officials that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would have to prove they were AIDS-free The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> community in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> numbers about 800, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, public affairs specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that since the autumn of 1987 AIDS has been on the list of contagious diseases which require a rejection of an application for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa. Pravda reported Nov. 11 that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had concluded agreements with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and its East bloc allies that require their nationals seeking to enter the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to prove they are not AIDS carriers.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims extremely susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, shared hypodermic needles, transfusion of infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Small-Town Movie Critic Banned From Area's Only Theater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLYTHE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The only film critic in town, a free-lancer who refuses to write about R-rated pictures, has been barred from this desert hamlet's lone theater because of her negative reviews. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, who writes for the twice-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, was handed her admission fee back during a recent screening of `` Gorillas in the Mist'' and asked to leave the <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON>. `` People were staying away from the theater because of her reviews,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the owner's brother and an attorney for the theater, said in today's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. `` The feeling inside the theater, whether right or wrong, was that her criticism was not evenly balanced.'' Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> argued that her reviews of family-oriented films are largely positive, and she vowed not to be silenced. The 29-year-old wife of an elementary school teacher, who gets $ 8 for each review, said she will cross into <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and make the 90-mile desert drive to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, site of the next-closest theater, to see the same films showing at the Blythe. `` I'm incensed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> said. `` By driving to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> I'm telling them they ca n't stop me from writing reviews. The drama in this town of 8,400 residents situated about 220 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has prompted angry editorials by the 4,500-circulation newspaper and picketing outside the 600-seat theater at the paper's urging. The critic said the ban was unfounded. `` Of the 28 reviews I have written, 17 have been positive,'' she said. `` That's a pretty good percentage,'' mused <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON>, a movie reviewer for Newsweek magazine. `` I do n't think any of us would survive in <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> co-owner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose theater does n't advertise in the newspaper, has called <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> a dilettante with no credentials to review films. `` Were her distorted, negative and unfair criticism harmless,'' he said in a letter to the editor, `` we could perhaps ignore her, and chuck it off to a small-town mind that dabbles in writing newspaper articles.''

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is rounding out the top ranks of his administration by nominating retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as energy secretary and former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as drug czar, transition and congressional sources said today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to announce the selections at a news conference a few hours before holding a late-afternoon dress-rehearsal meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the historic residence across from the White House. `` He will talk about what he expects of them, what his priorities are, what's important,'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition press secretary, said of the first gathering of the president-elect's top appointees. Sources who declined to be identified confirmed that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top uniformed officer, would be tapped for the energy post and that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> would get the job of coordinating the government's war on drugs. CBS News first reported on <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' selection and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> had disclosed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s new role. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a hard time filling both jobs, the last top-level posts that were vacant. Aides suggested that he vacillated on the energy post between an oil-state candidate and one with experience in nuclear energy. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> faces a multibillion-dollar cleanup of the nation's aging and increasingly unsafe nuclear weapons plants. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, who was a nuclear submarine commander before becoming chief of naval operations, is considered an authority on nuclear warfare. Other contenders for the energy job were identified by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition sources as former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash. Another contender, former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, was told he was no longer being considered, transition sources said Wednesday Along with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> had been mentioned previously as prospective drug czars. Today's gathering of top officials in the incoming administration was designed to `` give the president-elect and his senior staff the opportunity to share how they see the first week of the administration,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sign an executive order immediately after he is sworn in next week setting up a panel to review ethics for government appointees. The advisory commission will be co-chaired by <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the former attorney general in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, a senior judge on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here, she said. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his decision to attend Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral next month, saying he was `` doing what's right. The decision has been criticized by veterans and others who resent <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role in World War II. A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviator whose plane was shot down by the Japanese in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1944, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I speak from a pretty good vantage point.'' `` We have a good relationship with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. I want to see it even better, and this does n't concern me a bit. And you're talking to a person who was in combat in World War II,'' he said. `` I feel you always look ahead, not always look back.'' Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> government and business professor, was announced as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief domestic policy adviser. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, 42, was a White House adviser in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term and also worked as an assistant to former President Ford. He is a professor of business and government at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. Other announcements included: _ <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aide and the director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural committee, as assistant to the president for special activities and initiatives _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and former vice presidential aide, as assistant for issues analysis _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> as deputy counsel, the same job he has held in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential office _ B <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, as deputy press secretaries. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has been a deputy press secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential spokesman and Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> served in a similar capacity in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office.

<HEAD>British Official Says Gadhafi Most Dangerous Backer of IRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is `` the most dangerous'' backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which he has supplied with many advanced weapons and plastic explosives, a senior <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> leader said today. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has supplied the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> with a plastic explosive called Semtex. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has said the Czechoslovakian-made material was probably used in the bombing of the Pan American jumbo jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last month in which 270 were killed. Authorities say they do not yet know who planted that bomb or why, and <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> did not make any reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster in his speech to a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> military academy. `` A significant portion of the explosives and weapons held by a few hundred active -LRB- IRA -RRB- terrorists are shipped from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is without doubt the most dangerous of the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters,'' he added, referring to the dominant wing of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have proof that he has supplied them with tons of sophisticated weapons and large quantities of Semtex explosives.'' `` He has also provided them with ample funds and as recently as September reiterated his political support for them,'' said <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. British officials previously have said Libyan-supplied Semtex probably reached the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in three shipments that arrived in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. The Irish government, unlike the British, has never pointed a finger directly at the Libyans, although it says it has told <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that it condemns the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and does n't want <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to support the group. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fighter jet on a training mission accidentally dropped a three-foot practice bomb, digging a foot-deep crater in a family's back yard but causing no injuries, officials said. The eight-pound bomb had a detonator charge, similar to a shotgun shell, that emits smoke when it hits the ground, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Cecil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who bilked investors into sinking $ 2.4 million into a bogus self-chilling beverage container drew 12 years in prison despite his lawyer's insistence he was only a terrified `` franchise'' for the mob. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON>, 42, was bullied by mobsters into carrying out the fraud, defense attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said Wednesday. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON>: `` Your conduct has been your character. You are a con man.'' <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON>, who could have received 20 years in prison, pleaded guilty in 1987 to racketeering. Five others were convicted in the scheme to promote a phony self-chilling can. <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> and his co-defendants promoted Laser Arms, incorporated in 1986, through fake news releases, ads, and shareholder reports. They staged a phony news conference and prepared company documents with photos of actors portraying executives. As part of a plea agreement, <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> has been providing information on organized-crime involvement in securities manipulation, said <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. Indictments are expected, authorities said. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> was used as a `` vehicle'' by mobsters and was `` viewed by a number of people as a person they could franchise to make money for them.'' <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> agreed with the term franchise but said that mobsters beat <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> and threatened him to continue carrying out the Laser Arms fraud. <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON>, who was living in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, is in the witness protection program. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has implicated <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> in at least seven securities fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s, authorities said. <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said that despite a `` track record'' of securities violations, <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON> never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud as Laser Arms. At one point, <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said, mobsters kidnapped <PERSON> Zolp </PERSON>, held a gun to his side, said he was to be murdered and beat him.

 Police arrested 10 Spanish Basque militants, including <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Urutigoechea </PERSON>, considered by <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque separatist organization <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said today. Spanish officials, party leaders, and newspapers applauded the arrest of <LOCATION> Urutigoechea </LOCATION>, 38, also known as `` <PERSON> Josu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ternera </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading daily, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pais </LOCATION>, said the arrest means `` <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has lost its staunchest, longest-active leader, suffering the toughest blow.'' <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has carried out a 20-year campaign of violence in a bid to secure independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the three-province northern Spanish Basque region. It maintains bases across the border in French Basque country. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the arrests represented the most important setback to <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> since police in southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> arrested dozens of suspects in raids on Sept. 30, 1987. <LOCATION> Urutigoechea </LOCATION> and the others were arrested Wednesday in the cities of <LOCATION> Bayonee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonloc </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poitiers </LOCATION> in west-central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A police spokeman said on condition of anonymity that authorities arrested <PERSON> Urutigoechea </PERSON> as he was driving a motorcyle down a towpath along the <LOCATION> Nive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>. He did not resist, even though he was armed with a pistol and a grenade, police said. Police said they arrested two others at a house he had just left, six in <LOCATION> Poitier </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Bonloc </LOCATION>. There was no immediate word on whether criminal charges would be filed against the 10 or whether they would be extradited to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> told reporters, `` The police actions and the arrests are of great importance to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> society on such a major matter as the battle against terrorism.'' Since taking up arms in 1968, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mainly <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> security and military forces. The arrests came four days after <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> declared a 15-day suspension of attacks in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as a sign of good faith to persuade the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> government to open talks on the Spanish Basque region. Authorities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> said the arrests were carried out through close cooperation on both sides of the border.

<TEXT>
 Angry settlers shouted down Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> today and demanded that the government do more to quell the Palestinian uprising. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, troops shot and killed an 11-year-old Palestinian during clashes following the funeral of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager who died of wounds suffered earlier, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army confirmed both deaths. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who spoke at a mourning ceremony in <LOCATION> Brakha </LOCATION> for a slain Jewish settler, was confronted by a crowd of 200 settlers. They screamed demands that he put an end to attacks on Jews by Palestinians and chanted: `` You are doing nothing.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the settlers that the greatest danger to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was dissension among Jews. `` One thing only can hurt our ability to stand firm: quarrels among brothers, or worse civil war among them,'' he said. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops broke up a sit-in by hundreds of Jewish settlers near the settlement of <PERSON> Yakir </PERSON> who also demanded the army crack down harder on Palestinians involved in the 13-month-old uprising. The army set up roadblocks throughout the area to prevent more settlers from reaching the site where the sit-in began Wednesday but dozens broke through one roadblock and were chased by troops, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Also today, 18-year-old <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Irut </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> was shot in the head and critically wounded by Palestinians who accused him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, troops wounded three Palestinians in a clash with stone-throwers, the army said. Palestinian reports said the confrontation began after settlers opened fire on a Palestinian youth who stoned their car. In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the army imposed a curfew on the <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> neighborhood and arrested <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents according to prepared lists, police said. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police commander <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehudai </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that the action was the start of a new policy of imposing curfews on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhoods to quell disturbances. Curfews are frequently imposed in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, but rarely used in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers its capital. In <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, 11, died of a bullet wound to the chest during a clash in which hundreds of Palestinians hurled rocks and burned tires to protest the death of another <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> youth hours earlier, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Three other <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> residents were in critical condition after being shot in the clash, hospital officials said. Troops imposed a curfew on the city and a nearby refugee camp. The clashes were caused by news of the death of 17-year-old <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddeni </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, who died at east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after being shot in the head in a Jan. 1 clash. Residents called a general strike following <PERSON> Maddeni </PERSON>'s death and raised outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and black flags of mourning, the Arab reports said. Hundreds of students poured into the streets upon hearing news of the death. The deaths raised to 351 the number of Palestinians killed in the Palestinian revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation. Fifteen Israelis also have died. Since the uprising began, settlers have complained of insufficient protection by the army. They have sought permission to fire on stone-throwers and demanded deportations of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists on a large scale. About 65,000 Jewish settlers live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, along with about 850,000 Palestinians.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who just months ago could command a national television audience, got a chilly response to his request for five minutes' air time on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> TV stations to pitch a tax increase. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday asked stations for time at the start of their newscasts tonight to make his case directly to voters. <ORGANIZATION> WCVB </ORGANIZATION> said no. News executive <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Balboni </PERSON> called the request a `` completely inappropriate'' attempt to manipulate the news. `` Our responsibility is to cover that story but to cover it from all sides and then report it to our viewers, and that is what we will do,'' he said. Executives at <ORGANIZATION> WNEV </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the governor's request. Other stations said they were discussing it. WBZ demanded a copy of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech before noon today before deciding whether to give him air time, a request <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press secretary said would not be met, news director <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said. As a result, the station will not provide air time. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> public TV station <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> was not asked for the time. Managing editor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> VanScoyoc </PERSON> said the governor would appear on its news show tonight in an interview. `` It's a way for the governor to reach the most people directly,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary, said in explaining the request. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not seeking the TV time because news accounts are incomplete or biased. He said the hope was to deliver to viewers the type of statement newspapers often provide when they publish texts of major addresses. According to officials familiar with the governor's thinking, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to seek up to $ 200 million extra income in the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and as much as $ 600 million next year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has acknowledged a shortfall of at least $ 600 million in the state's current $ 11.6 billion budget, a gap he attributes to a revenue slowdown.

 The government today said West German companies or individuals may have helped build a suspected chemical arms plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and that it is checking for any violations of export laws. The issue has aggravated normally warm relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and West German. `` The federal government has indications of the possible participation of German companies or persons at this plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' chief government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said in a statement. `` West German authorities are intensively pursuing these leads,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said without providing details. He said the government is checking documents held by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to decide if it should prosecute violations of export law that may have occurred. Earlier today, government officials said indications that West German companies helped build and outfit the plant had embarrassed the government and damaged the nation's image. `` There is no question these allegations have caused serious damage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s international prestige,'' said a high-ranking government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The government is in an extremely embarrassing and difficult position,'' said the official, referring to developments that forced Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to reverse statements that there was no evidence of involvement by West German companies in the affair. Earlier today, authorities conceded unofficially they had found `` indications'' that at least two West German companies played major roles in supplying equipment for the plant, and a shipper also implicated in the affair was arrested in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON>, said today on `` CBS This Morning'' that West Germans `` did help us, not only in this plant, in other plants also. `` We have a vast cooperation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and certainly some companies participated in this pharmaceutical plant,'' <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON> said. The Libyan leader, Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, says the factory, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is for the production of pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> conceded in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network that `` there are a number of indications that evidently point in this direction'' of West German involvement in the plant. Federal officials confirmed a criminal investigation has begun against a now-defunct <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> company _ I.B.I. Engineering _ and that investigators had seized company documents. Officials also confirmed that the documents linked another company, <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lahr </ORGANIZATION>, to the construction project, backing claims made by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month. A source with the <ORGANIZATION> Belgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, director-general of Cross Link of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, was taken into custody and charged with forging shipping documents for goods sent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Under West German law, the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> must approve export licenses for arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to produce them. There is also a ban on export of high technology to `` sensitive areas.'' <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> last week announced that an initial investigation of Imhausen-Chemie turned up no evidence of illegal shipments. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials did not let up in pressing their case on the involvement of West German firms, and the controversy has dominated news reports and political discussions in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Suffolk County Law On Use of Video Display Terminals Takes Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A law requiring rest breaks and special training for many workers using video display terminals went into effect today in a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> county despite a legal challenge. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health officials, who will enforce the law, estimated that it applies to 8,500 VDT users in 150 to 200 businesses. The measure is believed to be the first VDT-regulating law enacted by a local government. A state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge is expected to rule within the next two weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses. The judge has already granted the four businesses a preliminary injunction blocking a section of the law that would have required employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations and glasses for VDT operators. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 18-member legislature approved the law in June over the objections of County Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, who said it would hurt businesses and was of questionable value to VDT operators. The measure applies to operators who spend more than 26 hours a week in front of a screen in a private workplace with 20 or more terminals. Beginning today, those workers must be given a 15-minute break or alternate work assignment every three hours. The employers also must notify VDT operators of health hazards, including eye strain and nervous disorders, which may result from prolonged use of VDTs, and must schedule training in recognizing symptoms and taking protective steps. The law does not include fines for violations, but health officials can file civil charges to force compliance.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with decision on Nagorno-Karabakh. No

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet government's highest executive body today imposed a `` special form of administration'' on the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region while keeping it within the Azerbaijani republic, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was another step by the government aimed at defusing tensions over the mostly Armenian enclave, which has been the focus of a violent struggle between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The dispute between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which wants to annex the area, and neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has led to more than 60 deaths in almost a year of unrest. About 200,000 refugees have streamed across the border. Military law and a strict curfew were imposed in many parts of the two republics in November to quell ethnic violence. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the decision today was made at a meeting of the Presidium convened by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to consider `` urgent'' state issues. There had been unconfirmed reports in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region for more than a month that the Kremlin would transfer <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to the Russian federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, in an effort to end the dispute. But a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> statement made it clear the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> intended to keep the small, mountainous region within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Presidium `` found it expedient to temporarily introduce in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> autonomous region a special form of administration, with <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> retaining its status as an autnomous region incorporated in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not explain what the special administration entailed, and said a decree will be published later by the official press. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last week that a special commission of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> was to meet Wednesday to consider the ethnic dispute between the two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. There was no word Wednesday from state-run media that such a meeting had taken place, although <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs of the two republics met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and agreed to try to persuade refugees who fled ethnic violence to return to their homes. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s predominantly Armenian population began agitating in February for annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and ther cause was taken up by thousands of demonstrators in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, and other Armenian cities. The demands led to violence between the two ethnic groups in both republics. In July, the Presidium turned down the Armenian annexation requests, and opted instead for a program of government economic and social aid for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Plague Wipes Out Arsenal Prairie Dogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An outbreak of plague has wiped out one-fifth of the prairie dogs at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, but the onset of winter is believed to have killed the fleas carrying the disease, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials say. `` We've lost 1,000 of our 5,500 acres of prairie dogs,'' Capt. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical contamination cleanup operations, said Wednesday. No humans are believed to have contracted the disease, but it may have spread to coyotes, officials said. Only fleas, not mammals, can transmit the disease, which usually takes the form of bubonic plague in humans. <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and Wildlife biologists noticed a large decline in the prairie dog population last month. The Army restricted access to the area and called in an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> entomologist, but the weather turned cold and the scientist was unable to obtain flea samples, <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON> said. `` So we contracted for a coyote specialist to trap four animals,'' <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON> said. `` We forwarded blood samples from the coyotes to the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> and on Jan. 3 they confirmed the presence of plague.'' The coyotes carried antibodies to the plague, but it was not known whether they had contracted the disease, he said. <PERSON> Kingery </PERSON> said there is no threat to anyone visiting the arsenal.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader: No Action on Hostage Issue on Horizon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leading Lebanese Moslem Shiite clergyman was quoted as saying there will be no developments involving foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until sometime after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, spoke in an interview published Wednesday in the London-based Saudi Arabian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION>. He said that the prevailing view before had been that the hostage issue would move once the American presidential election campaign was over. `` But we did not see anything on the horizon at the time to indicate that.'' `` But I cautiously expect that after sufficient time has lapsed following the new American president taking office that the issue of the hostages moves anew,'' he was quoted as saying. There are 15 foreigners believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON>, who spent most of December in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, recalled in the interview that he had predicted before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598 _ the basis for the Iran-Iraq cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20 _ that the hostage issue would grow more complex. `` Contrary to the conviction prevailing at the time, we expected the issue of the Western hostages of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to become more complicated. It seems our prediction was correct. For despite the passage of more than five months after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of 598, there has not been any progress whatsoever in the issue of the hostages,'' he was quoted as saying. `` We still hold the same view. That the time has not yet come for the issue of the hostages,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamseddine </PERSON> said `` considerable prudence will be needed in dealing with the hostage issue. But I say that ending the issue is not going to take as much time as it took till now. Until when? I am not in a position to state or speculate.'' Asked about links between the hostages and the fighting between Shiite militias in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where the hostaes are believed held, he said he did not see a clear connection but there was a link that he could not talk about in the interview. On the future of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said that it was intertwined with a Lebanese political settlement, noting that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> backed the predominately Moslem government of <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has had rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> governments since its <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> when his term expired Sept. 23, 1988.

Faith says she'll tell him after <PERSON> Maeve </PERSON> sings. Fans, like <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, will never hear the answer. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said it canceled the soap because too many affiliates chose to pre-empt the low-rated drama for noon newscasts. `` ` <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s Hope' has not been rejected by the audience, it has simply been unavailable to viewers,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerich </PERSON>, vice president of daytime programs for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, said at the time. `` Without sufficient stations to carry it, it has become a victim of audience erosion.''

But they said the victors in the 17th century battle at <LOCATION> Naseby </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> would have preferred the court to abide by Transport Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON>'s decision `` The wisdom of investing this exercise of judgment to a democratically elected minister rather than the court would have appealed to those who won the day at <LOCATION> Naseby </LOCATION>,'' wrote Lord Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>. Sir <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>, vice chairman of the Society for the Protection of the Field of the Battle of <LOCATION> Naseby </LOCATION>, shot back: `` <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON> might have been a bit of a destructive chap himself, but he would never have approved of this.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staged an unusual `` farewell review'' for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today, and the military services were told to absorb the undisclosed cost of the pageant. Responding to the military honors heaped on him in the 45-minute ceremony, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the 595 men and women in the armed forces whom he said had died in defense of freedom since he became president in 1981. `` Over the last eight years, the lustre has been restored to the reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as yours,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the assembly. `` Those days will never come again,'' he said, to applause that thundered inside a hangar at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` But it is not just your fellow Americans who owe you a debt,'' the president said. `` Because we remained strong, because we acted when we believed we had to, in the last eight years, not one inch of ground on this earth fell under communist control.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> presented the president with medals from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and its four armed services plus the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at the opening of the event. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies, which he said had contributed to the Soviet decision to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the planned Vietnamese pull out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` Your vision of a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> assuming its rightful role on the world stage has produced lasting results. Our nation has moved from self-doubt to self-confidence,'' he said. Much of the planned fanfare was canceled because of a steady rain that fell throughout the morning, and the ceremonies were held inside a 14-story-tall hangar designed to hold the two new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 airliners being delivered later this year for presidential use. First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> canceled plans to attend the salute because she has `` a touch of laryngitis,'' said a spokeswoman, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toler </PERSON>. `` She just is n't feeling well and decided not to got out in the cold,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Toler </PERSON> said. Inside the hanger were some of the fruits of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trillion-dollar military buildup, including the the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s new B-1B bomber, as well as jet fighters, helicopters, an Army M-1A tank, and one of the E-4B aerial command post planes that is always standing by in case of war <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, also was on hand and greeted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as he sat down to watch a military review that bagan with a display by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Colonial Fife and <ORGANIZATION> Drum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> dressed in Revolutionary War garb. The ceremony included a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> film lauding <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his decisions to invade <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983, bomb <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986 and escort <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> oil tankers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> two years ago. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` we want to thank you and thank you sincerely for the legacy of strength that you are leaving to our next commander-in-chief.'' `` You have made patriotism fashionable again and serving in the military attractive,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. On a jocular note, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> cautioned <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` the weather will not be like this in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' referring to the drier climate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will live after Jan. 20. Among the outdoor events canceled because of the rain were fly-overs of 17 military aircraft. The Marine Band provided music and the Joint Service Honor Guard marched before the president. Every four-star general and admiral was invited to attend, along with about 1,400 VIPs and government officials. Despite such elaborate preparations, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it could not estimate the cost of the farewell `` at this time.'' `` Funding for the salute will be absorbed by each of the services,'' it said. `` Each service also is responsible for funding -LRB- the attendance of -RRB- their respective general and flag officers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged it was not a normal practice to stage such a farewell for an outgoing president. `` It has not been done in recent history,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said, but refusing to define `` recent history.''

 A slowdown by <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> airlines mechanics involved in a labor dispute forced the state-owned carrier <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> to cancel 86 domestic and European flights Thursday, a company spokesman said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrade </PERSON> said 6,000 passengers were affected by the cancellations, which included flights to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> had 461 flights scheduled for Thursday, he said.

<HEAD>Three Potatoes in Four Never Make It to Soviet Tables</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is suffering through a potato shortage, and more than three out of every four spuds never make it to the dinner table because of waste, rot and loss in transit, a newpaper said Thursday. `` What's happening in our country with the potato?'' the Communist youth daily <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> asked. `` Why is it on the list of goods in short supply?'' The potato, known to Russians as their `` second bread,'' is an important staple in many Soviets' diet. But it has been absent or in short supply in many of the country's food stores for weeks. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> that Soviet state and collective farms produce more than 31 million tons of potatoes annually _ twice the American crop. Americans, though, can eat potatoes all year because crop loss, from the field to the kitchen, is only 5 percent, <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> said. In comparison, Soviets buying potatoes _ a crop that's usually packaged with a generous quantity of dried mud and already rotten vegetables _ end up throwing out half the purchase, <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> said. `` It happens that if all losses are counted en route to the consumer, only 7 million tons of potatoes make it ` to the cooking pot,''' <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> told the paper. `` Less than a quarter of the entire harvest!'' He called the potato shortage an indication of the woes of Soviet agriculture as a whole, which because of more than a half-century of state planning has been geared to meeting government production targets rather than developing efficient techniques of management and food transportation and storage. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for the widespread leasing of state-owned farm land to individual peasants to increase food supply by allowing them to earn more for producing more. The Communist Party has scheduled a meeting on agriculture in February.

 Rescuers used harnesses to free two divers trapped in icy water 55 feet down for up to 11 hours, but both died, officials said today. The divers, who were repairing an 80-foot-high, 72-year-old wilderness dam owned by <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, became trapped Wednesday by water pressure at openings they had cut in the dam on <LOCATION> Chesuncook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, authorities said.

<HEAD>Independence May Not End Troubles in Namibia's Embattled North</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ONDANGWA, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 22 years of warfare, curfews and atrocities, the beleaguered Ovambo people of northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> are on the threshold of emerging as power brokers in the transition to independence. There is an air of excitement in <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION>, where half of all Namibians live. But there also are worries about the staggering problems that will confront a new government after independence elections Nov. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, has agreed to withdraw from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony under the terms of a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution. The pullout of South African troops will deprive garrison towns of their main source of income. The return of tens of thousands of exiles and refugees will strain local resources, and the possible takeover of power by the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement could trigger vendettas against Ovambos who worked with or fought for South African authorities. `` To be free and independent does n't mean we are suddenly in paradise,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleopas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumeni </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, by far the largest denomination in the region. `` We can accomplish the task of nation-building only if we do it together.'' <PERSON> Dumeni </PERSON>'s plea for reconciliation is heartfelt. His brother was killed by a military patrol and one of his daughters was killed in a bomb blast blamed on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. Ovamboland, in the center of northernmost <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, covers only 7 percent of territory's land, but accomodates roughly half its 1.3 million people, most of them living in huts or corrugated metal shacks. It is the region where the guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ has its strongest support and where most of the low-intensity guerrilla war has been waged. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has a legal political wing operating in <LOCATION> Nambia </LOCATION>, but the guerrilla movement is outlawed. In the coming months, <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION> is expected to become a political and propaganda battleground, with an array of factions trying to ward off a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> victory in United Nations-monitored elections. Holding <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> to less than two-thirds of the vote would prevent it from having total control over the elected assembly that will draft <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s new constitution. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers claim <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will try to rig the voting to favor parties it considers more moderate. Ovambos say security forces are visiting villages with the message that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> plans communist-style collectivization and should be opposed. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> has said he does not forsee blanket nationalization of industries, but his exact political and economic programs have not been spelled out. Among those caught in the political crossfire is <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalangual </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ovambo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He has cooperated to a degree with the territorial government while at the same time trying, with mixed success, to maintain cordial relations with <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. `` True reconciliation is not a superficial thing,'' he said. `` For people who've been embittered it's not all that easy.'' In many cases, the conflict has splintered Ovambo families. While one son may have fled north to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to join <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, his brother may have joined <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, a police counterinsurgency unit widely accused of brutality. `` The parents are caught in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Kalangula </PERSON>, 62. `` They do n't know whether to turn left or right.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shikongo </LOCATION>, who works at a human rights center near <LOCATION> Ondangwa </LOCATION>, predicted that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> would discourage widespread retribution against <PERSON> Ovambos </PERSON> who served in the security forces but would conduct some sort of reorientation program. A retired Lutheran minister sympathetic to <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, German-born <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paully </PERSON> said some vengeance-taking was inevitable. `` Certainly people who have been really devilish will be hunted down,'' said <PERSON> Paully </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in 1951 and has married an Ovambo woman. `` Those in power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have done nothing to defuse this situation.'' The social and economic needs of post-independence <PERSON> Ovamboland </PERSON> will be vast. Up to 100,000 refugees and exiles, many of them ill or crippled, will be returning to a region already lacking adequate services and job opportunities. Many adults will lose their jobs as maids or maintenance workers when the South African army bases close. Changes will be needed in an education system where one underqualified teacher instructs 50 or more children in a South African-designed curriculum. `` Some students are anticipating a utopian world where, in an independent state, everyting is candies and honey,'' said <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Nandi </PERSON>, Ovamboland's education director. `` I tell them the opposite is true _ if independence comes everyone must be prepared to work 20 times harder.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s servicemen and women today as `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pride'' at an elaborate military review designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to bid farewell to their commander-in-chief. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking at the end of the 45-minute ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also called for a moment of silence to remember the 595 persons who had died in the service of their country over the past eight years of his presidency. `` They are not with us today, because they are at God's right hand. ... They voluntered. They chose to serve, they gave their lives. They are our heroes,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president was treated to as much pomp and circumstance as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could muster for the rainy-day ceremony, which was moved inside a 14-story-tall hangar at the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> base. Although a fly-by of military jets had to be canceled because of the foul weather, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was treated to a review of troops, music by the scarlet-uniformed Marine Band, and a movie hailing his military buildup during his two terms in office. He also received service medals during the festivities. Arrayed as a backdrop were the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s new B-1B bomber, as well as jet fighters and helicopters, many of them purchased during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trillion-dollar military buildup. `` Mr. President, the pride people feel today _ certainly the pride felt by the men and women in our armed forces _ is a direct result of the leadership you have provided as commander-in-chief,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` You have restored not only our national strength _ but also our sense of purpose.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was thankful to have born `` the most sacred of tasks'' as the nation's commander-in-chief and to oversee a resurgence of spirit among the nation's military. `` Where, I have at times asked myself, where have you come from? How you've managed to cohere into the crack, disciplined, patriotic band of brothers I see before me this morning?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. He offered his own answer: `` You come from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and you are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pride. On behalf of all <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I thank you, and pray God that he may bless you now and forever.'' The president said he ordered first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to cancel plans to attend the ceremony because she was suffering from laryngitis. The farewell came the day after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered his own Oval Office goodbye, in which he said he was handing the nation over to the `` good hands'' of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In a televised speech bidding adieu to the nation, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boasted Wednesday night of his accomplishments and ignored many of the difficulties that arose during his eight years in office. `` We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world,'' he said. Yet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also admitted that his self-styled conservative revolution left many things unchanged, and he asked his followers to stick around and help his successor. `` If we're to finish the job, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Regiments will have to become the Bush Brigades,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Soon he'll be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.'' The president said he was leaving office with the central message of his political life strengthened _ that an unfettered economy, a strong defense and a free citizenry forged a nation `` respected in the world, and looked to for leadership.'' `` Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive,'' he said. `` Because we are a great nation, our challenges seem complex. It will always be this way. But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> addressed the nation from his Oval Office desk, his left hand in a splint and swathed in bandages from weekend surgery on a finger. Speaking nine days before his retirement to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called his departure `` sweet sorrow.'' But he also said he looks forward to a renewal of personal freedom, contending a modern president must live `` somewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving.'' Another regret, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, was his failure to tame the nation's deficit But that merited only a paragraph in the roughly 21-minute speech. `` I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but tonight is n't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue,'' he said. The national debt almost tripled in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term and he ran up the biggest budget deficits in history. His final budget proposal, released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, projects a deficit of $ 92.5 billion. The president's remarks were void of any mention of such national tragedies as the barracks bombing that killed more than 241 servicemen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Challenger disaster or the Americans held hostage in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. There was no word of the trade deficits or the scandals that tarnished his administration, such as the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and use of the proceeds to fund the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> illegally. The Contras, subject of so many <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> speeches, were not mentioned at all. As triumphs <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> listed the nation's economic recovery, its low unemployment and inflation, and its bolstered military. The president who warned early in his tenure of the `` evil empire'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> took credit at the end of his presidency for forging `` a satisfying new closeness'' with the Soviets. He said the new relationship helped bring about the first U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons, as well as `` a new peacefulness around the globe.'' `` What it all boils down to is this: I want the new closeness to continue,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But he advised those who follow to `` trust but verify. ... Watch closely _ and do n't be afraid to see what you see.'' `` We must keep up our guard _ but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust,'' he said.

 The daughter of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has asked the government for permission to form a women's association, an official report said Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted the English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostafavi </PERSON> applied for permission with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> `` to form the Women's Society of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The agency quoted the newspaper as saying Mrs. <PERSON> Mostafavi </PERSON> has been active in Iranian women's affairs. It added, `` She has always emphasized that women should better realize their rights and concentrate their efforts on regaining their denied ones.''

<HEAD>Officers Sue Over Job Transfers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two police officers who led the investigation of the deaths of seven people unearthed in a boardinghouse yard are suing their bosses for transferring them to other jobs. Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Enloe </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> allege their reassignments were punitive and illegal; their superiors maintain the transfers were routine. `` These transfers were precipitous, unwise and unfair,'' said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was an effort to use the officers as scapegoats for the errors of management.'' The Police Department came under fire for allowing <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> to walk away from the house Nov. 12, one day after the first body was discovered in her yard. Police have also been criticized for allowing a reporter to interview <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> on a media-chartered flight back to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> after her capture in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, 59, has been charged with murdering one of her tenants, and prosecutors have said they expect to file more murder counts at a court hearing next week.

<HEAD>CIA Chief Says Good Progress in Bombing Probe; Soviets Might Help</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds one graf of Soviet comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators are making good progress in probing the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet last month, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said in an interview published today, and he thinks Soviet intelligence agents would pass on any tip they might have on who is responsible. `` The leads are very encouraging. We've come a long way in understanding what caused the crash'' in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed 270 people Dec. 21, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. `` We understand the nature of the -LRB- explosive -RRB- device and we already have a good reading on those organizations that were capable of acquiring _ I do n't want to say manufacturing _ such a device and getting it through the security gates that are in place to protect international traveling,'' he said. `` There's a real determination to stay with this,'' he added. But, the intelligence chief said, `` I ca n't tell you when or how soon'' the case will be broken. Middle Eastern terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bombing, in which a plastic explosive was placed in a forward cargo hold in the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jumbo jet. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, asked whether the government of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was suspect, hesitated for 10 seconds and then said: `` I do n't think we're in a position to say that.'' Asked about the possibility that Soviet intelligence agents might pass on a tip as to who was responsible for the bombing, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> replied: `` I would guess they would.'' `` It's a view that I have held that conflicts with many who have thought that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was monolithically responsible for most of the terrorism around the world, particularly a decade ago,'' he continued. `` To whatever extent their involvement in training and supplying and shielding terrorists a decade ago may have been true,'' factors such as President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s desire to give the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a world leadership role have changed that, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> suggested. `` We've has intimations of a desire of the Soviets to work in the world arena to reduce the threat of terrorism,'' he said. At a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> news conference today dealing with other matters, Soviet charge d'affaires <PERSON> Evgeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutuvoy </PERSON> said he could add nothing to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s remarks. `` Probably he has some information on this subject I do n't have,'' <PERSON> Kutuvoy </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> today pressed the federal judge in the Iran-Contra case to drop conspiracy and theft charges against fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed a memorandum under seal in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in support of his motion of last Thursday to dismiss the two central counts. The charges that would be dropped allege that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants illegally diverted more than $ 14 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. The memo was accompanied by declarations from <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the independent counsel said in a statement. The material outlines the position of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that, out of concern for national security, it can not allow certain classified documents to be disclosed at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial in support of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s case <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> refused to dismiss the two counts on Monday, saying he first wanted an affidavit from <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> detailing the administration's objections to releasing the classified material contained in documents <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wanted to use to prosecute North. On Dec. 12, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said a substantial amount of classified material must be disclosed in order to give <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> a fair trial, including the names of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries where <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved in the secret resupply operation to the Contras. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also said that the ranks and duties of officials of foreign governments who appear in the classified documents must be disclosed, although the judge permitted the names of the officials to be deleted. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also insisted that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> personnel be identified as working for the agency, although not by name, and that the text of information obtained by intelligence be presented verbatim in most instances. Last Thursday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> moved to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges, citing <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s `` insistence on introducing classified information in his defense'' and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's refusal to release material the judge ruled <PERSON> North </PERSON> would need at trial. North is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carry prison terms totaling as much as 60 years. These include obstructing various congressional and presidential inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statements and destroying documents.

<HEAD>Report Calls for $81 Billion More to Modernize Nuclear Weapons Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today released a report calling for increased spending of $ 81 billion to modernize the nuclear weapons complex over the next 20 years and the closing of four major facilities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the 31-page report `` will enable the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a long-term approach to modernization rather than a piecemeal response to the problems within the nuclear weapons complex.'' It recommended stopping nuclear fuels processing at four sites where problems have been highly publicized: the Rocky Flats Plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the Hanford Site near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, the Feed Materials Production Center at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and the Mound Plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Waste management and environmental restoration at these sites will continue until completion,'' the report said. It was not clear whether research activity would continue at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, which produced the material for early atomic weapons during the 1940s. The report also said that the only three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reactors capable of producing tritium, a critical element in modern thermonuclear weapons, could not be restarted until late 1989. The three reactors, all at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, have been shut down since last April undergoing changes to make them safer. `` In spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable production efficiencies,'' said an unclassified version of the report, released at the White House. To meet tritium needs, the report repeated previous administration recommendations for the construction of a $ 3.2 billion heavy water reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and a $ 3.6 billion new design gas-cooled reactor at the Energy Department facility at <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The budget for fiscal 1990 includes money for the design of those new reactors. The report also addresses the problem of cleaning up nuclear contamination around the 15 largest facilities in 12 states, as well as modernizing the plants and closing down four of the most troubled operations. The money would be spent mostly by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures nuclear weapons and carries out related research for the Pentagon.

<TEXT>
 An architect of President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s unsuccessful executive-privilege Watergate defense is a top prospect for the post of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> solicitor general in the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a civil law expert, is among five or six candidates being considered for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top legal policy position by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. Also under consideration are two conservative federal appellate judges appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> of the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. Best known for his work for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> during the 1973-74 Watergate investigation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 61, has a formidable reputation among lawyers as a legal scholar and expert on federal court procedure. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> law professor, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> helped devise the legal argument that executive privilege exempted <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> from complying with a subpoena to surrender tape recordings of Oval Office conversations. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> accepted <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s argument that executive privilege was a valid concept, the justices ruled 8-0 in 1974 that he still was not exempt from subpoenas for evidence needed in court cases. In a decision that led to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s resignation, the high court ordered him to surrender the tapes, which contained damaging evidence of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> involvement in covering up the Watergate break-in. The presidential appointment of a solicitor general requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer, arguing cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and deciding whether to appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies. The solicitor is known in legal circles as the 10th justice because the high court has traditionally relied upon him to provide legal guidance. Charles Fried, the current solicitor, is leaving office to return to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Winter, 53, a former <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who became a judge in 1982, and <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, 42, who served as couselor to Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from 1981 until his appointment to the D.C. Circuit in 1983, had been mentioned as possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominees following the 1987 retirement of Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> gave up a seat on the 2nd Circuit to become solicitor general in 1965. Two years later, President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> named him to the high court. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s appointment as solicitor general would cap a distinguished career as a professor, appellate lawyer and expert on court procedure. He has represented the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, notably in death penalty and voting-age cases. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also is the co-author of the definiitive legal textbook on federal court procedures and practice.

<HEAD>Six Survivors Found in Rubble 35 Days After Armenian Earthquake</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Fixes 1st graf to clarify survivors weren't rescued today.</HEAD>

 Six people were pulled from the basement of a collapsed apartment building in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, 35 days after the Armenian earthquake, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. The men were quoted as saying they survived on canned vegetables, fruit, pickles and ham. The survivors were rescued Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, the 35th day after the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 25,000 people in northwest <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Rescuers last pulled a person alive from the wreckage Dec. 26, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The six men were found under the rubble in the basement of a nine-story apartment building which had collapsed on them, the official Soviet news agency said in a report from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. They survived because there was plenty of canned food stored in the basement, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. All are hospitalized in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> but none are in danger, doctors told the news agency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say how the six men were found or who rescued them. Officials had ended the search for survivors weeks ago, saying it was necessary to clear away the rubble to prevent disease spreading from decayed bodies. Authorities have been demolishing buildings that could not be rebuilt after the earthquake. One of the six survivors, <PERSON> Aikaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON>, had medical training and administered massages to the others to relieve the pain of their injuries, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. One of the men, <PERSON> Karlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkissyan </PERSON>, had a broken arm and the others sustained only minor injuries, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` On the day of the earthquake, I asked five neighbors to help me carry two heavy wooden kegs to the basement,'' <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> was quoted as telling <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` Just then, we suddenly heard a terrible roar. The earth trembled, and walls began to collapse. I thought a war had started.'' `` It's true, we used the food sparingly,'' the 50-year-old electrician said. `` After all, we had no idea what had happened, nor how long we would be entombed. We lost track of time completely. But we never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released. `` I had only one thought _ to do everything necessary so my young friends would not go crazy,'' <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said. `` I entertained them, calmed them, sang, and told stories about my life.'' He identified two of the other survivors as <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachaturyan </PERSON>. He said he could not remember the names of the others. <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said the men never had to worry about food and water because the basement was used to store tins of vegetables, fruits and pickles. `` It's true, we conserved the food in every possible way. But we never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released,'' he was quoted as saying. An editor at Armenpress, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> affiliate in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview there were no details of how the men were discovered because there is still only one telephone line to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. The editor, who would not give his name, said <PERSON> Akopyan </PERSON> said nothing about the rescue or conditions in the basement, and doctors were refusing to allow further interviews with him because he had developed pneumonia. He said his staff had not yet been able to meet with the other five survivors. The quake leveled much of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city 10 miles east of the Turkish border and left thousands homeless. Once home to more than 280,000 people, <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> today has only 100,000 inhabitants, thousands of whom now live in tents. Many residents have been evacuated. Survivors also have had to deal with bitter cold conditions and snow, which officials said hampered the rescue efforts. On Dec. 14, rescuers pulled a mother, <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosyan </PERSON>, and her 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Gayaney </PERSON>, out of the rubble in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. The two had been buried alive for eight days. To keep her daughter alive after their only food _ a jar of blackberry jam _ was gone, the mother had cut her fingers and fed the child blood.

 Olympic diver <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> was under a suicide watch in his jail cell today after pleading guilty to manslaughter by drunken driving in the deaths of two teen-agers, authorities said. `` He is scared to death of everything,'' said Maj. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a supervisor at the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. Jailers checked on <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> every 15 minutes because of warnings from his lawyers that he might be suicidal, authorities said. A series of psychiatric tests showed he has been developing suicidal tendencies, his lawyers said. `` We told the judge we were seriously concerned about his emotional state, and we told him of our concerns about self-destructive behavior,'' lawyer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> pleaded guilty to spare grieving relatives who had just heard gruesome testimony on the accident, his father said. `` He did it for the right reasons,'' a sobbing <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, father of the 1984 silver medalist, said outside the courtroom. `` He did not want to put the families of the kids through a horrible trial, or our family.'' The plea came Wednesday as testimony was just beginning in the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial on charges that the athlete drunkenly plowed into a crowd of teen-agers with his sports car in suburban <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> on Aug. 1. The late night crash injured six people. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> and his two passengers escaped serious injury. The case drew international attention when <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> decided to compete for a place on the 1988 Olympic diving team less than a month after the crash. He failed to make the squad. He pleaded guilty to two counts of driving under the influence manslaughter and three of causing great bodily harm while driving under the influence. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, who was jailed pending sentencing Jan. 30, faces seven to 22 years in prison. The plea surprised Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Skye </PERSON>, who was about to show jurors 43 color photographs of the crash scene. `` Obviously the pictures were the most graphically unpleasant part of this case,'' <PERSON> Skye </PERSON> said later. Before the plea, <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovitt </PERSON> testified about the accident scene for the prosecution. She described finding two bodies on the road `` in pieces'' and two of the injured teens, one bleeding badly and moaning, another bloody and screaming. Killed in the accident were <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossic </PERSON>, 16. A 16-year-old who survived lost a leg, which was later reattached. <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> met with attorneys from both sides in Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>'s chambers for half an hour, then emerged grim and glassy eyed to make his guilty plea. `` Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty and for no other reason?'' <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> asked. `` Yes,'' replied <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, his voice barely audible. Among the victims' relatives and friends at the trial was <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>'s fiancee, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, who burst into tears outside the courtroom later and said, `` I'm just glad it's over. I think we all know the carnage that was out there.'' During opening arguments, defense attorney <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugate </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> had been drinking and speeding when his car hit the teen-agers on a dark dead-end street known as a hagout for teen-agers. His car was traveling faster than 75 mph, and an hour after the crash his blood-alcohol level was 0.2, twice the legal definition of intoxication, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Skye </PERSON> said another prosecution witness would have testified that after getting out of his car <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> beat his fist on the ground and said, `` There go the Olympics.'' When <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> to try out for the 1988 team, members of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> and victims' friends and relatives gathered there and staged a silent protest. But after Wednesday's guilty plea, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, who coached his son in diving at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It was <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>'s decision `` I am proud of him. I think it is something <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> is trying to face and I'm really sorry.''

 Drugs and housing problems worsened in urban America last year, and the shortage of affordable housing is the top hindrance to local economic growth, a survey of municipal officials said Thursday. The National League of Cities, releasing the findings of its annual survey of local officials, criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for major reductions in housing aid and for proposing to end local assistance to fight drugs. `` The efforts of city leaders to fight drugs and crime, to provide shelter and housing opportunities, to encourage investment in jobs and to support the economic growth of their community,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beals </PERSON>, executive director of the league, are `` being undermined by a ` fend for yourself' philosophy that is irrational, unconscionable and just plain wrong.'' The league, which represents large and small municipalities across the country, released the results of its survey of municipal officials at a news conference. It surveyed 690 officials in 473 communities last month. Two-thirds of the town officials reported local drug problems had worsened in 1988, and crime was described as worsening by 45 percent. `` In the face of unrelenting drug trafficking and drug-related violence, the president wants to abolish funding for local drug assistance,'' <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said. Ranked next among worsening conditions was the affordability of housing, affordability of rental housing, and homelessness. Forty percent or more of the respondents reported a worsening in each of those related categories. A majority, 51 percent, said the supply of affordable housing is inadequate for growth _ ranking that problem ahead of roads, education and other issues as impediments to economic development. <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget proposal for fiscal 1990, the federal fiscal year opening Oct. 1, would eliminate local revenue bonds for housing, cut aid for the homeless in half, cut low-income energy assistance by one-quarter, and make reductions in spending for community development, rental rehabilitation and low-income housing assistance. Despite the reported problems, more than half the officials reported overall economic conditions improved in their cities in 1988, and nearly half said unemployment diminished. Two-thirds said they expected to hold the line on taxes in the coming year, but 61 percent said they expected to raise fees and other charges. Those surveyed included officials from cities and towns of all sizes and regions. Some 47 percent of them were in the category of small cities, with populations of 10,000 to 50,000.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has hired a laboratory to find out the shelf life of condoms exposed to various climatic conditions. An estimated 5.5 billion condoms are produced each year worldwide. They are used for birth control and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS. But because condoms are made of rubber, which deteriorates, they could be ineffective if they are n't properly stored or distributed quickly enough. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has contracted with the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to examine condoms' shelf life. The three-year, $ 440,000 study will monitor the deterioration of condoms exposed to heat, cold, humidity, light and air pollution. `` I'm not sure that any condom made in a large manufacturing country is capable of withstanding developing-country environments,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchings </PERSON>, a program officer with the 11-year-old non-profit research organization. Ms. <PERSON> Hutchings </PERSON> said little is known about what happens to condoms after they leave the controlled conditions of a manufacturing plant. She said boxes of U.S.-made condoms will be stored in different climates worldwide and will be tested every six months.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father has turned his television set back on, but he said he and his wife are still stinging from the slings and arrows flung at their son during the presidential campaign. `` The untruths and distortions could have filled a 12-volume encyclopedia,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a hometown audience Wednesday. The elder <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>, said the family is still upset by media coverage of his son's selection as President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, and of the campaign that led to their election in November. `` I hope nobody at the Herald-Press does to you what the media did to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>,'' he told about 170 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> dinner. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, developed a routine for reading papers during the campaign. He would go out to the mailbox and glance at the headlines. Then his wife would ask: `` Should I read it?'' Often, he said, the answer was no. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he told a `` Nightline'' producer that he would not talk to host <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> about their son's treatment by the media because he and his wife were boycotting TV. `` We've turned our set back on, but only for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> -LRB- a conservative commentator -RRB-, the World Series and weather,'' he said he told the producer. The Quayles received about 1,500 letters during the campaign, most of them regarding their son's National Guard service and the `` you're no <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' remark by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, during the vice-presidential debate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said responses on both were overwhelmingly in his son's favor.

 More than 900,000 census-takers fanned out from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Thursday to start the first nationwide head count of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s population in a decade. Data gathered during the eight-day census, including on Soviets' education level, place of residence, ethnic group and language, will be used `` to plan the main directions of the country's economic and social development,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda said The census is the first in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1979, when the population was found to number 262.4 million. In January 1988, government statisticians estimated the Soviet population at 284.5 million. In the next eight days, census-takers will call at Soviets' homes, but will also comb railway stations, airports, trains, planes, shops, hotels and hospitals to assure an accurate population count, Pravda said Foreigners who live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will also be counted, Pravda said. One-quarter of the Soviets polled will be asked to answer additional questions, including where their workplace is located, the time they've resided in their present home, its size and degree of comfort, and how many children they have given birth to if they are women, Pravda said. The census will also show the changing ethnic makeup of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Pravda said. Western demographers estimate the country's Moslem nationalities, because of a higher birthrate, could become a majority in the country by the end of the century. Pravda said preliminary results of the census are expected in April, and more definitive data in the fall of 1990. The newspaper assured Soviets that the answers they given census-takers will be kept confidential, and asked them to attentively answer the questions they are asked.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek and American officials Thursday ended another round of talks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases without making much headway toward a new agreement, a government spokesman said. `` A disagreement of views continues to be observable even though a deadlock was not noted,'' said <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the three-day talks. It was the first round of talks since a five-year operating agreement for the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations expired Dec. 20. Under the old accord, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 17 months to negotiate a new agreement or dismantle the bases. `` The talks were held, as in the past, in a serious and professional climate and an exchange of views continued,'' <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said. He said the talks, the 13th round since negotiations began in November 1987, focused on the legal aspects of a `` possible'' new agreement. He did not elaborate. He added, however, that negotiators were still at the `` preamble'' stage of a new accord. `` Discussion resumed on the preamble of a new agreement ... which has been under continuous processing during the negotiations,'' he said The talks have made little progress because of the socialist government's insistence that a new agreement provide assurances that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help solve the country's longtanding disputes with neighboring <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies have been at odds over military control of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, its seabed mineral rights and the divided eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they do n't want to involve regional politics in the bilateral bases talks. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, whose ruling <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has been rocked by series of financial scandals, is expected to use the bases issue to attract leftist voters in the upcoming June elections.

 A T-shirt being sold at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol Museum has been removed after complaints that it was emblazoned with an ethnic slur.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has asked former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Commissionchairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> to become chairman of the Wall Street giant struggling to rebound from a scandal raised by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>'s leadership. The nation's fifth-largest securities firm also said it had approached <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman from 1975 to 1977, to become a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, a trade consultant, is the husband of <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, tapped by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, instrumental in the firm's record $ 650 million settlement last month of securities-fraud charges, would continue in that role. There had been rumors he might resign. The announcements appeared to reflect an effort by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s senior management to distance the firm as much as possible from the Wall Street insider trading scandal that has entangled it since late 1986 `` The firm's objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the problems and opportunities it faces, and to continue to make an important contribution to the nation's capital markets,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement disclosing the job offers. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, information officer for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> is ambassador, confirmed in a telephone query that he'd `` been approached by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> about becoming chairman of the board.'' Neither <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would comment on a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today that quoted unidentified sources as saying <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> was close to accepting a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> offer. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> would accept the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> invitation. A receptionist at the <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consulting firm of which <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> is chairman, said he was out of the office. <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> ran the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> when it began a fraud probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> more than two years ago after speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> implicated the firm in his illegal acts. That probe resulted in <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> securities-fraud charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> as well as a record $ 650 million plea bargain with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office last month. The firm has been seeking a well-known and respected figure to take the chairman's job as part of an effort to recover from its legal ordeal. Shad is credited with strengthening the agency's efforts to reduce insider trading and other abuses on Wall Street. He resigned in 1987 after a six-year tenure to accept the ambassador's post. Word that <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> had been approached came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said it had agreed to end talks with former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> about a possible role for the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff in the firm's senior management. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> since November about a senior role in the management of the nation's fifth-biggest securities firm, possibly as chairman. His involvement was seen as part of a possible <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> strategy to minimize the impact of criminal charges that were then expected against the firm and some of its key employees. The announcement came as <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> worked to settle a civil suit filed by the agency against the firm in September. The settlement of criminal charges was reached Dec. 21 but is not final until resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suit. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks might be completed in a few days. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> declined to comment. The government investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s financial dealings began more than two years ago after now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> turned state's evidence and implicated the firm in his illegal acts. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> denied wrongdoing until last month, when it was threatened with possibly crippling charges of racketeering unless it agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. Under its settlement agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution and cooperate in the government's crackdown on securities fraud.

<HEAD>Businessman To Give Free Bikes To Kids Who Improve Grades, Attendance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A businessman whose efforts at philanthropy once were rebuffed by an entire school has turned to bicycles as a way to peddle education. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Argenbright </PERSON> is offering 1,500 students at 22 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> elementary schools free bicycles if they improve their attendance, behavior and grades. `` To me, it will be a real ego thing for these kids to show off those bikes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Argenbright </ORGANIZATION>, chief executive officer of the security and transportation firm <ORGANIZATION> Argenbright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They'll have worked hard to earn them.'' Schools were chosen for their low or declining test scores, and only students who are n't living up to their potential will be offered a chance to earn a new bicycle. The principal and teachers at each of the participating schools will select students for the program and will draw up a personal challenge for each child, specifying what changes in attendance, academic achievement and discipline must be demonstrated in order to earn the bicycle. `` These are our students with the greatest potential to improve,'' said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Superintendent <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I think this is an excellent program that will have a needed impact on the students,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Principal <PERSON> Effie </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` Our underachievers and those children who are overlooked or who are continually posing problems need that extra incentive and this appears to be the answer.'' The program will be launched at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 19, and the students' progress will be monitored weekly. <ORGANIZATION> Argenbright </ORGANIZATION> promised to pay the administrative costs of the program and chip in at least $ 5,000 toward the purchase of the bicycles. He will try to raise another $ 100,000 from large corporations. <ORGANIZATION> Argenbright </ORGANIZATION> hopes his latest plan will be more popular than last year's offer of a free college education to each graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in his hometown of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He flew 40 Madison students to <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to tour the city and campus. `` And then not one single student even bothered to fill out the application'' to attend <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, he said.

<TEXT>
 A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia entrenched on a mountaintop turned back a rival faction in fierce fighting Thursday in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. West of the battle in <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes bombed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> base it said was used for planning a staging terrorist attacks. Thursday marked the fifth straight day of fighting in the latest battle between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Police said <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> lost five combatants in an aborted attack to capture the mountain village of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said seven Amal militiamen also were injured in the attempt to storm <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions. A police spokesman said there was no report on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s possible casualties in <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, the key to a triangular-shaped enclave on the western edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> About 500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters held the spot. The new casualties brought the overall toll to 112 killed and 227 wounded in the fighting since Sunday. Four Israeli warplanes, meanwhile, attacked a base of Palestinian <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> faction in the Majdalyoun valley before dawn. The police spokesman, who can not be identified in line with police rules, said two of the jets fired four rockets into the base, located about four miles east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Ambulances evacuated the wounded, but a casualty count was not available. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is `` clever in hiding their losses. It is very difficult to estimate their casualties,'' the police spokesman said. Smoke billowed from the base, which Israeli warplanes also bombed Wednesday night along with another council stronghold in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Bkusta </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first air attack into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said its jets returned safely. The battle between the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions is the fourth major confrontation since April for control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect. By police count, 388 people were killed and 1,209 wounded in the previous three rounds of fighting. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> seeks to create an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> patterned after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The more secular <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> rejects <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual influence over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiites and favors a multi-sect government with Moslems sharing power equally with Christians. Amal called a general strike for Friday in predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to protest what it called `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s new Nazism.'' Amal was referring to atrocities committed by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters in an attack against <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> and four other villages in the region Sunday. Police said both groups have committed `` horrific atrocities'' in their current confrontation. Victims from both factions have been found with their heads chopped off or their bodies otherwise maimed. The police spokesman said the vanguard of a 1,000-strong Amal force attacking from the west, southwest and south reached <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> early in the day Thursday, `` but was pushed back by <PERSON> Hezbollahis </PERSON> in fierce fighting.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> pulled its attackers back to nearby villages in tanks and armored personnel carriers behind a heavy artillery cover, the spokesman said. An Amal commander in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, identified only by his code-name of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, confirmed that the attack failed. `` <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> is a mountain peak. Our fighters are in the valleys and we have to climb up to the Hezbollahis. This is not an easy task,'' he said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> said his forces blocked all supply lines to the nine-square-mile enclave, which stretches southeast from <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> to the nearby hamlets of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouswar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louwaizeh </PERSON> and the wooded slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safi </LOCATION>. `` We will besiege them for a while, until they run out of supplies and ammunition and then try again. We do n't want to sacrifice our fighters in a battle than we can win easily after a while,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators got a first look at the engines from a crashed <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 on Thursday, and British airlines flying similar craft said they found no evidence of faults in the engine warning systems. The engines from the British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 that crashed Sunday were removed from an embankment along a freeway near the town of <LOCATION> Kegworth </LOCATION> and taken to nearby <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The plane, bound for <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, crashed while trying an emergency landing at the airport, killing 44 people and injuring 82. Investigators are trying to determine why the plane's apparently working right engine was turned off during the flight when later examination showed it was the left engine that caught fire. Speculations have focused on a faulty engine warning system and crew error. Most of the wreckage will be reassembled at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Establishment </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON>, a senior inspector from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>. The engines, however, will be taken to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for detailed inspection by the manufacturer following a preliminary inspection at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, he said. `` We must await a full strip inspection of both engines. That's most important,'' <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON> said On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> ordered British airlines using <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320s equipped with the U.S.-French CFM56 engine to inspect the fire and vibration warning systems for `` left-right sense.'' Those checks were completed Thursday by six airlines, and none found any problems. The aviation authority also ordered more frequent inspections of the engines built by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also has ordered checks of the warning systems of 300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s operated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. Unlike the British agency, however, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> did not order more frequent engine inspections. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said there had been `` very, very isolated incidents'' of cross-wiring of warning systems in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft. But he said none had led to an accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it obtained evidence early in the investigation that both engines `` might have suffered a related failure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said there have been two crashes involving double failures of CFM56 engines. In both cases, foul weather was a contributing factor, but that was not an element in the British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> disaster. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reported Thursday that investigators believed the disaster began shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with the failure of the No. 3 bearing in the left engine, which created vibration and intense heat. As the captain throttled back on the damaged engine to prepare for an emergency landing, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the vibration would have ceased, and _ if the right engine had been shut down _ could have disguised the fact that the wrong engine had been turned off. The Times said investigators believe that the No. 3 bearing, just behind the engine's high-pressure compressor, broke down completely as the aircraft made its final approach, leaving the 737 without power. The newspaper said investigators believe that faulty wiring led to a false warning that the right engine, not the left, was on fire. However, it said the plugs that attach the warning circuits to cockpit levers are designed to prevent right and left from being accidentally swapped, and there was no indication how a false warning could have been given. A <ORGANIZATION> Tranport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to comment on the newspaper's report. The first funerals for crash victims were held Thursday in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, 65, and his wife <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON>, 59, `` were always together in life, and their bodies were found together in death. They died in each other's arms,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Aidan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said at a Requiem Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigid </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

 Marine commanders have brought charges against a lieutenant and two sergeants in the death of a soldier who had been left behind in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> during a training exercise, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said today. Earlier this week, the top two commanders of the soldier's battalion were relieved of command over the death of <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. He was left behind Aug. 30 and died of heat stroke. The military today said it has ordered a court-martial against First Lt. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who was in charge of posting <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> as a road guide for the exercise, on charges of disobeying an order, dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has been accused of disobeying orders to pair <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> with another Marine instead of posting him alone. In addition, Sgt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s platoon sergeant, and Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s squad leader, were charged with offenses including dereliction of duty and disobeying an order, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> was accused of disobeying orders not to grant leave to <PERSON> Turnell </PERSON> the day the exercise ended; the squad leader's absence resulted in a day's delay in noticing <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>'s absence, authorities said. Earlier charges against <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> were withdrawn Wednesday after his lawyer argued that the commander who convened the court-martial was himself disciplined in the case. Marine investigators said that <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> built a shelter from the desert sun during the exercise that originated at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Twentynine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palms </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, but died after the temperature reached 107 degrees.

 <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>'s `` Thirty Seconds Over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'' _ World War II terms that probably mean nothing to many Americans _ were cited by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a farewell address that cautioned his countrymen against forgetting their history. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged building patriotism through better knowledge of history. `` If we forget what we did, we wo n't know who we are,'' he said in his broadcast Wednesday night. `` I am warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the American spirit.'' He specifically mentioned `` why the pilgrims came'' to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 17th century in quest of religious freedom, `` who <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> was, and what those 30 seconds over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> meant,'' as well as the battle at <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the landing at <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Those examples of American derring-do and heroism may mean little to the 69 percent of the American population born since the end of World War II. The details: _ `` Thirty Seconds Over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'' _ An <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> demoralized by the surprise and destructive Japanese attack on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces at <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, on Dec. 7, 1941, and the subsequent heavy losses to the Japanese in the first months of the war was electrified by news of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and other Japanese cities. The country finally had something to cheer about. The daring raid occurred on April 18, 1942. Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> led 16 B-25 `` Mitchell'' bombers. First word came from <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, but confirmation came a month later from President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, who said the planes took off from `` Shangri-La'' _ a fictitious place _ but later it was disclosed that they had taken off from the deck of an aircraft carrier, the USS Hornet. The raid, in addition to bolstering American morale, slowed the Japanese offensive. Later, <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, a former stunt flyer, flight teacher and aeronautics pioneer, was awarded the Medal of Honor. The term `` 30 Seconds Over <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'' was the title of a popular movie about the raid. _ <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> _ The <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> beachhead, 33 miles south of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, saw some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II and accounted for many of the 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battle deaths in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> the first half of 1944 <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION> was a bloody way station on the road to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> _ The site, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, of the Allied invasion by land, sea and air of the European mainland which started June 6, 1944 After bitter fighting, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> retreated. The landing began the climactic stage of the war on the West European front, the drive from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the German homeland, culminating in the Nazi surrender the following year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled that on the 40th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> landings he read a letter from a young woman whose late father had fought at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> sector. The writer, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanatta </PERSON> <PERSON> Henn </PERSON>, `` said, we will always remember, we will never forget, what the boys of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> did,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> noted, adding, `` Well, let's help her keep her word.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Americans who are 35 and older `` grew up in a different <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' where they learned to love and appreciate their country either from school, their own family or `` from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or the family who lost someone at <LOCATION> Anzio </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Two public interest groups on Thursday assailed a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would exempt very low-level radioactive waste from federal regulations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> does not have the right to increase anyone's involuntary risks,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arrigo </PERSON>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based group She contended that the commission's proposal `` ignores the growing number of health studies that indicate that low doses of radiation increase the health risks of those exposed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to exempt from federal regulations low-level waste that would expose people to 10 millirems of radiation a year _ approximately the same amount of radiation involved in a whole-mouth dental X-ray. If finally adopted, the new rule would enable atomic power plants and other users of nuclear materials to dispose of such low-level radioactive waste as ordinary refuse shipped to incinerators or land fills. Ms. <PERSON> D'Arrigo </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff panel at a public meeting in suburban <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, that `` part of the responsibility for using radioactive materials for any purpose is keeping them from harming or potentially harming anyone _ in this generation and in future generations.'' `` Those who operate nuclear power stations and those who produce radioactive consumer products must be required to do whatever it takes, at whatever the cost, to keep the radiation they generate out of the lives and environments of those who choose not to increase their risk by exposure,'' she said. Also criticizing the proposed change was another anti-nuclear group, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Nuclear Power. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsrud </PERSON>, speaking for the coalition, asserted that `` all exposures to ionizing radiation may have deleterious genetic or somatic -LRB- body -RRB- effects.'' On this issue, she said, `` prudence and conservatism are essential to serve the public interest.'' Speakers endorsing the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> proposal included <PERSON> Lauriston </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of physicians and scientists involved with radiation biology and medicine. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that `` extremely costly protective measures'' are currently required by `` regulatory control of very low-level radiation exposures that are believed to be well below the need of regulation.'' `` If this is allowed to continue, estimates of future costs in unnecessary parts of programs of waste management and site cleanup have been estimated to range into billions of dollars,'' he said.

 Sikhs waging a separatist war in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> killed 36 people, hanging four in revenge for the executions of two Sikhs convicted in the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, police said Thursday. The two Sikhs were hanged Jan. 6 for the murder of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who was shot down Oct. 31, 1984, by Sikh members of her personal bodyguard. Militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent Sikh nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the only Indian state where the sect has a majority. Police superintendent <PERSON> Govind </PERSON> <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> said the headman of <LOCATION> Bhujiawali </LOCATION> village and his three brothers, all Hindus, were kidnapped Wednesday night by a raiding party of five Sikhs and found hanging from trees the next morning. He said a handwritten note claimed responsibility for an underground Sikh militia and threatened more hangings of Hindus in revenge for the executions of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> at the Tihar Central Jail in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Others killed Thursday were a Hindu couple and their two daughters and another Hindu couple; Sikh farmer <PERSON> Fakir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, his son and nephew, and seven others killed in separate attacks, police reported. Police in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the state capital, said 16 more people were reported killed Wednesday night, including other relatives of the hanged village headman and his brothers. Most victims of the Sikh radicals are Hindus, but they also attack moderate Sikhs who oppose the separatist campaign. The latest deaths bring the number of people killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year to more than 90. At least 2,400 people were killed in 1988. Although they have a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a northern state that includes <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s richest agrucultural land, Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of this predominantly Hindu nation's 800 million people. Those fighting for independence claim discrimination by the Hindus.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents today arrested a Korean-born naturalized citizen in an alleged international conspiracy to buy and export missiles and nerve-gas weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said.

Sarin attacks the central nervous system, quickly causing convulsions and death. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> described the gas as a `` very rapid, odorless, colorless poison which can enter the body by inhalation, absorption or injection.'' Also named in the complaint was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who was described in court documents as the operator of <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Authorities said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> had approached <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> on Jan. 6. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> later met with <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> and two other people in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel, the complaint. The identities of the others were not immediately known. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> later discussed with the undercover agent the shipment of nerve-gas bombs from the Port of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the complaint said. A man who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> offices today refused to comment and hung up. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s arrest in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> was the culmination a seven-month investigation, authorities said.

<HEAD>Reagan Expands Quota For Refugees From Soviet Union And Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will increase this fiscal year's quota of Soviet and Eastern European refugees by 7,000 by lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees, many of whom are former political prisoners unable to emigrate, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The decision brings to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will be permitted to enter this country. While the added slots will be taken mostly from the quota for refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials stressed the president has considerable flexibility to alter the totals later on. A high ceiling was set for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with the expectation of a major exodus of Vietnamese who had been detained in `` re-education camps,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. But, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unable to reach an agreement with <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> about processing. As a result, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, the slots would be reallocated to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Nearly 40,000 slots are available for Vietnamese, he said. `` There is no shortage of refugee or immigration numbers available to Vietnamese who wish to emigrate to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` The only shortages are the exit permits issued by Vietnamese authorities.'' Last year, only 2,500 exit permits were issued in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he said. Thousands of Soviet refugees, many of them Jews, are in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, waiting for permission to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the quota for them to enter this country is full. Additionally, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an average of 100 applicants a day approach the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said two employees of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help handle the processing. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, after pressuring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to step up Jewish emigration, has found itself in a paradoxical position. The Jewish exodus is at a nine-year high. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finds itself unable to process all those who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with exit permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but who sought entry here once they reached <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` The ceilings are not set in concrete,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Wednesday, demanding anonymity. He explained that over the eight months left in the current fiscal year, the ceilings can be adjusted by the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to meet changing situations. Soviet Jews were routinely admitted as political refugees, but late last year the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration required individuals to prove they were the specific victims of persecution. Otherwise, they were forced to compete for the available slots with other refugees from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Attempt To Remove Black Squatters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court on Thursday ruled in favor of 500 black squatters from a tiny <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> town who have been fighting an eviction order for the past year. <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge J.H. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> refused to give <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nolloth </LOCATION> municipal authorities the right to forcibly remove the squatters, who live in shacks and tents. `` Such an order, if granted, contemplated the possibility of a forcible removal of a large number of women and children to be dumped in the desert immediately outside the boundaries of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nolloth </LOCATION>, without shelter,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said in his ruling. Port Nolloth officials last year authorized themselves to remove the squatters, saying there was no land in the town where blacks could live legally. All residential areas in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are segregated by race, and no black neighborhood has been established in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nolloth </LOCATION>. The black community, however, took the officials to court and won an interim order allowing them to stay prior to <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>'s ruling Thursday. Port Nolloth authorities have not said where they want the squatters to go. The nearest black township is more than 300 miles away. Some of the blacks have lived in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nolloth </LOCATION> since 1980, and additional squatters migrated from nearby <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> last year. Only a few thousand people live in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nolloth </LOCATION>, one of the few towns in the semi-arid landscape that makes up the northwest corner of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Most of its residents work in the fishing or mining industry. An estimated 3.5 million blacks have been forcibly removed by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government during the past four decades. The government has said it no longer stages forced removals for political reasons, but may do so for health purposes or to prevent illegal squatting.

 No one quite knows why a Democrat with no ties to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got invited to his Jan. 20 inauguration, but the lucky lady says she's putting the gift tickets in her pocket and heading for the festivities. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> member of the Clover Town Council, got the unasked-for tickets in the mail last month. It's only a guess, but her name may have something to do with the mystery. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, both Republicans, are friends and political allies. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who is going to the inauguration, asked that his sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, be mailed tickets as well. The sister, whose married name is <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, did n't get the tickets.

 A team of wool wizards clipped, spun and wove their way to victory turning a sheep's wool into a shawl in 107 minutes using techniques artisans used centuries ago. `` We have a good team, everybody worked well together,'' breathless team captain <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyser </PERSON> said Wednesday night when the judges announced the winner in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Farm Show's Sheep to Shawl contest. After buying the shawl for $ 1,600, <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Breniser </PERSON> of Blue Ball, said the approximately 2-by-5 foot shawl was worth the money. `` It was a fair price,'' he said. `` They worked hard for it.'' The team earned about $ 14.95 per minute of work on the shawl. The <ORGANIZATION> Wool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wizards </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> beat out eight other teams of five. The contest began when nine shearers armed with snapping electric razors unceremoniously hauled a sheep between their legs, waited for the starting signal and began shaving the animal bald. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, shearer for the winning <ORGANIZATION> Wool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wizards </ORGANIZATION>, finished his sheep first in about 2 -LCB- minutes. The workers then carded the wool, brushing it with paddles so the fibers lay in one direction, worked it into yarn on a spinning wheel, and finally wove it into a shawl on a wooden frame loom.

 A billboard featuring a punk `` tooth fairy'' has been put up by an artist who proposes building a huge molar in the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to honor the first city to fluoridate its drinking water. The $ 550 billboard, put up Tuesday night, seeks support for `` Operation: <PERSON> Pearly </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>,'' of a proposed 600-pound, 18-foot-long abstract sculpture of a fiberglass tooth balanced atop a stainless steel pole 22 feet above the river, near downtown. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> proposed his sculpture in June. But the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> objects to the sculpture, contending a symbol of an extracted tooth may perpetuate stereotypes linking dentistry to pain. `` The billboard's got a big-time wrestler'' posing as the tooth fairy, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. `` He's got pink, spiked hair with a big white tooth earring. He's a bad dude, 6-3, 230 pounds solid. The billboard says ` Tooth or Consequences' and says ` Support Operation: Pearly White.''' <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said Wednesday he's raising money for his sculpture, but would n't say how much. The billboard will be in place for 10 days to two weeks, he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Stages Elaborate Ceremony To Salute Departing Commander-In-Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> summoned its four-star officers, the Marine Band and a 21-gun salute to stage an elaborate ceremony Thursday for a departing commander-in-chief, but kept the cost a military secret. With Marines in camouflage battle dress standing by under the wing of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> strategic bomber, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the military commander-in-chief, received a farewell salute from the nation's armed forces and told the men and women in uniform: `` You are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pride.'' At the ceremony in a new hangar built for the next <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, the presidential aircraft, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stood misty-eyed as the Marine Band, after playing the traditional Marine Hymn, followed with a rendition of `` <PERSON> Auld </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> <PERSON> Syne </PERSON>.'' The unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include flyovers of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. It was forced inside by a chilly rain. The flyovers were called off. The cost of the patriotic farewell was as elusive as a military secret. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had said Wednesday that it could not estimate the cost `` at this time'' and would not count the expense of aircraft performances in any event. `` Since the fly-by is being conducted using normal operational flying training hours, no additional costs will be incurred by the services,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Funding of the salute will be absorbed by each of the services,'' it added. First lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was also invited but stayed home because of laryngitis that has dogged her since before she and the president returned from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation on Jan. 5. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the estimated 1,400 government officials, members of the armed services and other guests that the first lady, `` who unfortunately is ill and has no voice, tried to get up and get here and I sent her back to bed.'' The 45-minute ceremony began with the firing of a 21-gun salute outside the hangar. Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> then presented the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distinguished </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to the president, telling him, `` You have restored our nation's pride in itself and the nation's armed forces' pride in our uniform.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also presented medals from the four armed services within the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, thanked the president `` for the legacy of strength you are leaving to our next commander-in chief'' after President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes over on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> interrupted his own eight-minute speech to lead the crowd in a moment of silence for 595 members of the armed services who have died in the line of duty in the last eight years. `` They volunteered; they chose to serve; they gave their lives; they are our heroes,'' he said. He did not call the moment of silence a prayer, but he bowed his head, closed his eyes and ended by saying, `` Amen.'' Addressing the living in the armed forces, he said that `` the credit _ the gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace _ properly goes, not to me, but rather to all of you.'' `` You come from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and the Northeast, from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and Adirondacks, from the inner cities and the most remote of farms,'' he said. `` You come from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and you are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pride. `` Over the last eight years, the luster has been restored to the reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as yours,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the assembly. `` Those days will never come again,'' he said, to thunderous applause. `` But it is not just your fellow Americans who owe you a debt,'' the president said. `` Because we remained strong, because we acted when we believed we had to, in the last eight years, not one inch of ground on this earth fell under communist control.'' Following his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday night, the salute was one of a series of sentiment-laden events for the president that will culminate in his return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a private citizen next week. To the left of the speakers on the platform in the 14-story hangar, Marines in camouflage paint and fatigues flanked one of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s new B-1B bombers. Elsewhere stood jet fighters, helicopters, an Army M-1A tank and one of the E-4B aerial command post planes that stand by in case of war _ all part of the trillion-dollar military build-up that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made a point of pride in his administration. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, was on hand and greeted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as he sat down to watch a military review that began with a display by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Colonial Fife and <ORGANIZATION> Drum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> dressed in Revolutionary War garb and included a color guard of the combined armed services and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Every four-star general and admiral was invited to attend.

 Proposed cuts in next year's school budget have unleashed a tempest of opposition, with one 11-year-old pupil reported to suggest that the finance minister `` should go hang himself.'' Expressen, the country's highest-circulation daily, ran the quote in bold type. It said it was quoting an 11-year-old it identified as <PERSON> Calle </PERSON>, one of hundreds of students who wrote to the daily papers to complain of a proposed reductions in next year's school budget. Education exploded into a political drama when Finance Minister <PERSON> Kjell-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s most popular leaders, targeted schools for spending reductions in the 1989-90 budget package presented to Parliament this week. Trimming the education budget was <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s latest move to hold the line on wages and put a lid on inflation, now running at more than 6 percent, well above the European average. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s taxes have long been among the highest in the world, and generous education benefits are a big part of what the taxes buy. On Wednesday, 12,000 primary and high-school students marched through downtown Stockholm to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Some climbed up on window ledges and overturned flowerpots, chanting `` Stop <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>!'' Opposition to <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s governing Social Democrats united in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and threatened to kill the budget legislation. <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> said teachers' salaries went up last year by more than the 5.6 percent ceiling set by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and that schools should take into account a falling number of students. Primary school teachers' salaries start at $ 1,400 monthly, and college-trained teachers with 15 years of experience earn $ 2,267, near the average national income. Critics charge that the planned cut of $ 27 million from education, or 0.5 percent of its budget, ignored a crisis resulting from 10 years of insufficent government allocations. They say school buildings are falling into disrepair, tattered textbooks are handed from one class to the next, and qualified teachers are abandoning education for better-paid jobs in industry. The protesters demand a limit of 20 pupils per class, newer books, better food in schools, and a doubling of the monthly government stipend to each student from the current $ 78. <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s proposals are part of his broad efforts to keep the Swedish budget in shape. In seven years as finance minister, he has wiped out a huge annual deficit to give <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> its first surplus budget since 1962, often through policies that go against the socialist leanings of his party. He has proposed a sweeping reform to simplify taxes, plug deduction loopholes and reduce tax on overtime payments. At the same time, <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> has been unable to buck the tide in his party for more benefits and leisure time for workers. The Social Democrats have promised six weeks annual vacation for everyone. They have pledged to extend parental leave for new parents _ mother or father _ from nine months with full pay to 12 months this year and 18 months in 1990. The school crisis has prompted <PERSON> Claes-Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kjellander </PERSON>, political editor of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>, to question Swedes' favorable attitude toward <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> and his predecessors `` They raise our taxes, they spend our money for unnecessary things, and cut the grants for things we think are important. This is repeated year after year. The more it's repeated, the better we like them,'' he wrote. The pupil identified as <PERSON> Calle </PERSON> was reported to hold other notions. After <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> complained that <ORGANIZATION> Expressen </ORGANIZATION> reached `` the lowest point of Swedish journalism'' by using the schoolboy to attack his draft budget, <ORGANIZATION> Expressen </ORGANIZATION> put this response from <LOCATION> Calle </LOCATION> on its front page: `` Hey, <PERSON> Kjell-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>: You know you do n't really have to hang yourself. I only meant, for example, ` Go throw yourself against a wall.' You are making a booboo.''

Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the first woman to lead a Moslem nation, did not say whether she and <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> would press Afghan guerrillas for a political settlement before the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal of Soviet forces. `` We are watching what form of government is offered by the mujahedeen -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- before making an assessment of the Afghan problem,'' she said. `` It's for the Afghans to decide ... because they're the ones fighting.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> support the Moslem guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.

<HEAD>Royal Shakespeare Company Plans Biggest Year Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced plans for its biggest Shakespeare year ever with 14 of the bard's plays and shorter contracts for actors aimed at attracting more top talent. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hands </PERSON>, the subsidized theater's artistic director, unveiled a new `` one-year, two-season work cycle'' under which actors will commit themselves to one 60-week contract, playing the first half of the season at the company's home theater in <LOCATION> Stratford-upon-Avon </LOCATION> before transferring the productions to its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> base at the <LOCATION> Barbican </LOCATION>. This replaces the two-year schedule in which actors had to make a two-year commitment and spent one year at <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> and the second in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The system is meant to encourage actors to join the company by allowing them the flexibility to couple stage work with the more lucrative film and television assignments that make long runs in the theater possible. `` It's not a change in the basic policy ... It's a continuing experiment,'' said Hands, adding: `` English actors do not like long runs.'' Hands declined to name names, but said the old system had mitigated against getting those top talents who would not sign such a lengthy contract. He said the company will present 27 plays in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>. The 1989 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> season begins at the end of March with the transfers from <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> of last year's mainstage and studio productions, which included <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> as <PERSON> Prospero </PERSON> in `` The Tempest'' and a series of plays from, and about, the Restoration period. Two new productions, to open in July and September respectively, will be revivals of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s `` The Man Who Came To Dinner'' and <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON>'s `` The Master Builder,'' with <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> playing the doomed visionary, <PERSON> Solness </PERSON>. The spring <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> line-up begins April 11 with `` A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and includes <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Cymbeline,'' `` Hamlet,'' and `` <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>,'' before those productions in turn transfer to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in November. At that point, two more productions enter the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> repertory: a stage adaptation of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>'s novel `` A Clockwork Orange'' and `` Have,'' by Hungarian writer <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>. The autumn sees a new <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> roster of `` As You Like It,'' `` All's Well That Ends Well,'' and `` <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>.'' Besides Wood, actors announced for the upcoming season include such RSC veterans as <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, and promising young talents such as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rylance </PERSON>, who will play <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. American playwright <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who wrote the book for the short-lived Broadway musical `` Chess,'' will open a new play, `` Some Americans Abroad,'' in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in July. Other plans by the company include a six-week European tour in February and March of the company's highly praised `` Titus Andronicus.'' This year marks the first time in four years that the company has no musical on tap. `` Les Miserables,'' which opened at the Barbican in 1985, is an ongoing worldwide hit, but its revival of `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>'' failed to transfer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its most recent musical, `` Carrie,'' was a disaster, closing on Broadway after five performances in May.

<HEAD>New Ulcer Drug Rated Better Than Commonly Used Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new ulcer drug that is still being tested is superior to one of the mainstays of ulcer treatment because it promotes healing and relieves symptoms more quickly, according to a new study. The drug, known generically as omeprazole, was found to work better than Zantac, one of two widely used treatments for ulcers of the digestive system. `` I have a good feeling about this drug. It seems to be more effective,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> was among physicians at 45 institutions in 13 countries who compared omeprazole and Zantac on 602 patients. The results were published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said he expects the new drug to be approved for routine use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> within the next year. The latest study compared the two drugs in patients with stomach ulcers. After one month of treatment, ulcers had healed in 80 percent of those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving Zantac. After two months, 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85 percent of the Zantac patients had healed. The drugs work by blocking the body's secretion of hydrochloric acid, but omeprazole does so far more completely than other drugs on the market. An estimated 20 million Americans get digestive ulcers. They are holes in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum, which is the upper part of the small intestine. Earlier studies have found omeprazole to be superior to Tagamet, the other commonly prescribed ulcer medicine, in healing duodenal ulcers. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, who has also studied the new drug, said some experts are concerned about the long-term effects of shutting down acid secretion almost completely. `` I think this drug actually is a step forward, but it's into some uncharted areas,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` Only time will tell if that is best for patients.'' He said that while omeprazole will probably be widely prescribed, it's still unclear whether it will become the drug of choice in the highly competitive market for ulcer remedies. The latest study concluded that `` omeprazole is superior to ranitidine -LRB- Zantac -RRB- in the treatment of benign gastric ulcer'' because it produced faster healing and gave more rapid relief of symptoms.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials seeking to erode support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> filed a complaint Thursday against an influential pro-Israel lobby and 53 political action committees, charging they had violated federal election laws. The 100-page complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was filed by one-time Undersecretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, former ambassador to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Akins </PERSON>, former ambassador to <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Killgore </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Findley </PERSON> and three others. The complaint, supported by more than two dozen exhibits, alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has overstepped its legal lobbying activities by targeting political candidates for election or defeat based on their positions toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The complainants further claimed that <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> channeled funds and volunteers to such campaigns in violation of its registered purpose as a lobbyist. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> has in the past denied such activities but declined to discuss the complaint, citing <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations of confidentiality. The complaint, researched by a major Arab-American organization called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, demands that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> force <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> to register as a PAC and disclose its activities. Such a ruling would hamper the effectiveness of the lobby, which operates behind the scenes to recruit support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid with $ 3 billion annually, and to oppose weapons sales to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foes of the Jewish state. `` <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s formidable ability to mobilize congressional support ... is based not upon an appeal to the American national interest but upon threats by a special interest that has resorted to conspiracy and collusion,'' said a statement by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON>, formerly the chief inspector of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and one of the plaintiffs. But a brief statement by <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> said its `` members proudly participate in the American political process and do so within the law. We are confident the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> will expeditiously concur.'' <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> and others have argued over the years that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy is skewed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s favor to the detriment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standing in the Arab world, both politically and economically <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> and its supporters contend that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is the only stable democracy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and a vital ally for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the volatile region. They also point to broad support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in public opinion surveys. There are only a handful of pro-Arab PACs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and they are outspent as much as 10-to-1 by the pro-Israel groups. The complaint, the first against <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> in its 15-year history, also charges that the lobby coordinates the activities of dozens of PACs and uses them to channel funds to candidates. The complaint cites two internal <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> memos, one of which urges a colleague to ensure that pro-Israel PACs channel contributions to certain <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. The petition also seeks to prove collusion between <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> and 53 pro-Israel PACs through their common cause and an overlap of their officials. It is not uncommon in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for directors of PACs to be active on boards of special interest groups or corporations. If the charge of collusion is accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>, it could find that the PACs exceeded their contribution limits because the law treats all contributions by affiliated committees as though they were made by a single group. The complaint, which also demands that the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> order candidates to return such excessive contributions, cited the 1988 <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> senatorial race, which the complaint contends was targeted by <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION> through its allegedly affiliated PACs. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Licht </PERSON>, who was allegedly supported by $ 172,000 from pro-Israel PACs, ran against incumbent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, but lost. <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, who voted in 1981 to sell AWACS surveillance aircraft to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, did not receive a dime from pro-Israel PACs, the complaint alleges. <ORGANIZATION> AIPAC </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, noting that most of the evidence cited by the complainants is based on newspaper clippings and anonymous claims, said, `` There has been no effort to influence PACs; they make their own decisions.'' He declined to be named. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> generally takes 30 to 45 days to decide whether to investigate a complaint.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> legislator introduced a resolution Thursday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the slayings of three civil rights workers in 1964. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaggs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the resolution would put the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> `` on record'' in commemorating the June 21, 1964, deaths of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>. None of the sites of significant events during the civil rights era bear state monuments, including the site near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where the three slain civil rights workers were found buried in an earthen dam. There is a monument to the three men at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, but it was erected by the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Talk about state markers has been fueled in recent weeks by the release of the movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the slayings and subsequent investigation. `` We keep saying <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is changing,'' said <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, former field director for the state <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, `` but we do n't do anything to show it.'' A state marker `` would speak louder and show we actually have changed,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. `` That would be a better indicator that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is changing than anything else.'' It was too early to assess reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flaggs </PERSON> issued a statement saying the three civil rights workers `` dedicated and sacrificed their lives for the benefit of others.'' `` It is imperative that the citizens of this state recognize the humanist efforts which were demonstrated by those three courageous civil rights workers who believed in justice and equality for everyone, regardless of race, color or creed,'' he said. State historian <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said funding for state markers was lost in 1980 and has not been restored. But he called the slayings the turning point in the civil rights movement, and clearly favored commemorating them. `` It's one of the most historic sites in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' he said. A marker, he said, would show `` we can recognize the truth and no longer cover it up. We are no longer a closed society.''

During the meeting, Libyan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jadallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzouz </PERSON> <PERSON> Talhi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions against his country were aimed at dissuading <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states from possessing arms that could threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> requested the meeting of foreign ministers after two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planes downed the Libyan jets, which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say were about to attack the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> craft. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the action was unrelated to concern that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has built a plant for making chemical weapons. The plant, which <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says is for producing medicine, was a main topic at a five-day international conference this week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on banning chemical weapons. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has the biggest stock of chemical arms in the world, and it is trying to obstruct other countries from having their own,'' said Arab League Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON>. The conference ended without agreement on a ban. <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> members who attended sought to tie chemical disarmament to nuclear disarmament. They said that until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gives up its nuclear force, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states need chemical arms for defense. The Arab position was not included in the final document. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke to the league's uprising subcommittee of six foreign ministers that has been responsible for ensuring support for Palestinians in the occupied territories. He charged the group with neglecting its responsibility. The exact amount of aid promised is not known, but is generally believed to be about $ 128 million in emergency aid and $ 43 million in additional help each month. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> first began complaining about a lack of aid at a June meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> that was dedicated to organising financial and diplomatic support for Palestinians. The committee issued a statement urging league members to adhere to their promises.

 The judge hearing the case for compensation to victims of the 1984 gas leak in this city has been transferred after he was found to be biased against the company, officials said Thursday. He is the fourth judge to be moved from the <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trying the case since the world's largest civil suit began in 1985.

<TEXT>
 The government released more than 200 political prisoners Thursday after newly elected President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> lifted a 5 -LCB- - year state of emergency in this ethnically troubled land, the military said `` I still do n't know why I was brought here,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 39, as he left <PERSON> Tyronne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> Cricket Stadium, a temporary military camp in <LOCATION> Moratuwa </LOCATION>, about six miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rupasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Padmasiri </PERSON>, the father of another prisoner, said, `` My son is a rice paddy farmer, the father of three children. He has no involvement with the Sinhalese extremists.'' He said his 28-year-old son, <PERSON> Panduka </PERSON>, was arrested while buying groceries. Military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 234 political prisoners were freed after the emergency rules were lifted at midnight. The rules were imposed in May 1983 after ethnic riots between the Sinhalese majority and Tamils, who are fighting for independence. Extended month by month, they empowered security forces to arrest and indefinitely detain a suspect without charge and to search houses without warrants. When the president revoked the emergency state three days before it was again to expire, he said about 1,800 political prisoners detained without charge would be released. Within hours, 110 prisoners were freed at a detention camp in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the military said. Ninety-nine were released from the <LOCATION> Moratuwa </LOCATION> camp, and 25 others were allowed to leave a prison in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, it said. All had been held without charge since November for alleged involvement with Sinhalese extremists trying to overthrow the government, said one military official. Each signed a statement before leaving prison saying he had been treated well and would not bring charges against security forces, the official said. Military officials said other prisoners would be released later but gave no details. The detainees include both Sinhalese and Tamils accused of violence against the state and assassinations of government legislators, police and soldiers. This island off the southern tip of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has suffered spiraling violence since 1983, when militant Tamils launched their separatist war. Since then, more than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians, have died in massacres, ambushes and guerrilla battles. The dead include more than 600 Indian soldiers, part of a peacekeeping force sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in July 1987 to try to disarm Tamil insurgents. In his campaign for president, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> pledged to press for withdrawal of the 50,000 Indian troops. A few thousand were reported to be pulled out earlier this month. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, was sworn in as president on Jan. 2 after winning last month's presidential election. In addition to the other deaths, more than 650 government supporters, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed by Sinhalese extremists. They oppose former President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s efforts to make peace with the Tamils by granting them limited automony in the northern and eastern provinces Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people They say they are denied jobs and education by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control the government.

<HEAD>Long-term Use Of Acyclovir Effective Against Herpes, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Studies at five medical centers show that acyclovir, an antiviral drug, can reduce or eliminate recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes even when taken for more than a year, a researcher said Thursday. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, said a double-blind study involving 261 patients with active herpes infections showed that outbreaks of the disease were virtually eliminated for about half of those taking acyclovir twice daily. `` These were all patients who before had had about one recurrence of herpes a month'' and had been infected for more than a year, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said half of the 261 patients in the study received 400 milligrams of acyclovir twice a day for a year, while the other half received only a placebo. `` For those who took the active drug daily, about half -LRB- 46 percent -RRB- had no recurrence of herpes outbreak at all'' during the year, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` In the other half, who took the drug, the recurrences were very mild and they lasted a day instead of five days as before,'' he said. Members of the active drug group averaged 1.8 recurrences for the whole year. In the placebo group, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, `` there was virtually no change in the frequency of the outbreaks.'' He said those in the placebo group each averaged 8.5 herpes episodes over 12 months, and only five percent of this group experienced no episode. Genital herpes is caused by a virus that generally is spread through sexual contact in which one partner has open lesions of the disease. Herpes infects the genital tract of both men and women and will periodically cause infected lesions on genital surfaces. For some infected with the disease, these episodes can be very painful, frequent and continue for years. For others, the pain and formation of lesions may occur only once and then not reappear. `` For 20 to 30 percent of those infected,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, `` the outbreaks are very frequent occurences that continue for many years.'' He said patients used in the study `` were selected from a population that has lots of trouble with herpes.'' Although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective temporarily against herpes, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the double-blind trial was the first to demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over many months. `` The trial shows that if you have a population that has frequent recurrences you can treat them for a long period of time and it is safe and it works,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. In addition to <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, the study trials were conducted at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Prison Warden Who Was Stabbed By Female Guard Is Suspended for Losing
Key</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A warden has been suspended for losing the master key to the prison, an incident that corrections officials believe is linked to the warden's relationship with a female guard who allegedly stabbed him. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 49, warden at the maximum-security <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Men </LOCATION>'s Facility in <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, was placed on indefinite suspension without pay Jan. 3, the day he was stabbed in the back by Sgt. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, officials said. He faces a Corrections Department hearing Jan. 30, spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> said Thursday. The stabbing occurred at a service station in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> stopped for gas on his way to work. Police said <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, a guard at the Cotton Regional Facility in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, followed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to the service station and stabbed him with a 6-inch knife when he got out of his car. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was treated at a hospital and released. Corrections officials believe the key was lost during an argument between the two Dec. 17 in <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>' apartment. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was found naked and struggling with the knife-wielding <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, who had summoned police, according to police reports. He left the woman's apartment after receiving a change of clothing. Corrections officials believe the key to the 470-bed prison was lost in his original clothing. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said she had been involved in an eight-year affair with <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is married, according to court records. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, who has been suspended from her job and faces felony charges in the stabbing incident, was caught in a `` Fatal Attraction'' - type relationship and that he was trying to counsel her `` Fatal Attraction'' was a 1987 film about a woman's obsessive pursuit of a married man. While the lost master key unlocks all interior doors, including cells, it does not unlock exterior doors or the prison's weapon's arsenal, Light said Replacing the locks would cost $ 40,000 to $ 65,000, she said, adding that corrections officials have n't decided whether to make the change. `` The supposition is that the key was not lost inside the institution but is floating around somewhere outside the prison,'' Light said. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, who was called an excellent employee by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeley </PERSON>, an assistant to the warden at the Cotton facility, faces charges of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and carrying a concealed weapon. Free on $ 5,000 bond, she waived a preliminary examination and was bound over for arraignment in <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 18, according to the county Prosecutor's Office. The maximum penalty for convictions on the charges is 10 years in prison. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseworth </PERSON>, deputy director of the department's bureau of correctional facilities, was serving as acting warden of the <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> facility, Light said.

<HEAD>Suggests Review of Tax Laws to Guard Against Abuses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that he would not advocate government action to curtail corporate takeovers but suggested a review of tax laws might be needed to guard against abuses. `` I am not in favor of the government picking winners and losers,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference called to announce his final Cabinet choices. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he planned any action to put the brakes on the increasing number of takeovers, many through so-called leveraged buyouts. `` You are talking to one who would as much as possible rely on market forces,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buy out stockholders and take over the target company. Sometimes such buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover. The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear that high debt levels, particularly in a recession, could endanger both the bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` if there are abuses of our tax laws, ... the whole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.'' The vice president did not elaborate, but hinted that his administration might examine changes in tax laws to make clearer the distinction between debt and equity.

<HEAD>Burmese Students Fly Home, Officials Deny Forced Repatriations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of 76 Burmese students flew home Thursday from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the prime minister was reported to reject charges of earlier forced repatriations. The latest return brought to 260 the number who have come home since the repatriation program began Dec. 26, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said. Thousands of students, at the forefront of pro-democracy protests through much of last year, fled to Thai border areas controlled by anti-government guerrillas after Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup Sept. 18 and his troops killed hundreds of demonstrators. Two Burmese aircraft took the latest group of students from a processing center in the northern city of Tak to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The students were seen off by the Tak governor and <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials and welcomed aboard the planes by Burmese military officers. Forty-four more students will return the same way Friday, officials say. They will be accompanied by <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and foreign journalists invited by the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military to try to dispel charges that the students were being forced back to face harsh treatment by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> authorities. Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> rejected as `` absolutely untrue'' charges by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights group, that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> forcibly repatriated 22 students who flew from Tak to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Jan. 6, Thai newspapers reported Thursday. Speaking with reporters Wednesday, <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> was quoted as saying he tore up the telexed statement with the charges from the London-based group as soon as he saw it. He suggested Amnesty was interfering in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s affairs, but he said it and other humanitarian groups were welcome to observe the repatriations of the students. `` We did n't force them back and they all smiled happily when boarding the planes,'' he said, according to The Nation newspaper. `` <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is a developing country in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, so it is normal that those <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries like to think that we are still barbarians,'' he was quoted as saying. Thai military officers in charge of the repatriation program also have strongly denied Amnesty's charges. The Amnesty statement, received in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said concern for the students' safety was based on `` increasing evidence'' that many Burmese arrested for involvement in the demonstrations have been held without charge or trial. It cited evidence that some were tortured. The group's statement said the 22, of the Shan ethnic minority, were rounded up by <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> police two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. The statement said: `` They are said to have repeatedly expressed fears for their safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities not to be returned to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and eventually went on a hunger strike. They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from Tak airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel. The group said 14 students detained with them are believed still held at Tak airport, pending similar repatriation. Reporters who accompanied the 22 students on the flight quoted them as expressing concern for their safety in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> at first promised the students temporary asylum, but <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Chavalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Dec. 14 and reached an agreement with <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> to repatriate the students. Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at the border.

 Opting for education over earrings, two brothers gave in to their principal Thursday and agreed to take off their earrings during school hours. But their parents say they'll continue to fight the order <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunderland </PERSON>, a junior at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> R-3 High School, and his brother, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, a seventh-grader, returned to classes for the first time in the week since the controversy started. `` I'd like to wear my earring, but I do n't want to flunk,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>. `` I take mine off as I enter the school and put it back on as I leave the door.'' Principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the brothers would have flunked all their courses for the quarter if they had accumulated seven unexcused absences. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> banned earrings for boys on Jan. 4 after an outbreak of name-calling and pushing and shoving between boys who wore earrings and those who did n't. He gave eight boys who wore earrings the next day the option of taking them off or leaving. Two boys stayed in school; the other six, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, left but eventually returned to class. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the school's dress code gives administrators the discretion to ban things that would be `` disruptive to the educational process.'' But the brothers' parents, <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunderland </PERSON>, argue that their sons are victims, not perpetrators. They said they intend to explore legal action against the school. `` They did n't start the trouble and now they are being punished unfairly,'' Mrs. <ORGANIZATION> Sunderland </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's sexual discrimination. If the boys ca n't wear'em, then the girls ca n't.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sunderland </ORGANIZATION>, a truck driver, had his own ear pierced and now wears an earring himself in a show of solidarity with his sons. `` I was outraged,'' he said. `` I did it in the belief of standing up for my boys and what they believe in. That's why I'm pushing it.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Says Some Reforms `Skidding,' Promises To Do Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist Party on Thursday unveiled a campaign platform that promises a higher Soviet standard of living but acknowledges that some of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are `` skidding.'' Nearly four years after launching an ambitious modernization program to raise living standards and open its long-closed society to public scrutiny, the party said, `` The economy has not yet begun to operate in a new way. People have not yet come to feel fully the results of restructuring.'' The expectations raised by perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program, are far from being met, the platform said. `` Progress in some areas, including the social sphere, is skidding.'' The platform was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a plenary meeting on Tuesday and published in full by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. At the same meeting, the leadership picked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and 99 other top officials of the ruling party to run for election to the party's 100 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> Despite a new election law allowing `` an unlimited number of candidates'' to participate in the March 26 election, the move guaranteed the top Communist leaders uncontested seats in the new 2,250-member parliament, which will elect the nation's president and a full-time legislature. The party's first priority is `` a solution to the most acute issue: the food problem,'' the platform said. But it offered few clues to how it would accomplish that, saying only that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> soon will hold another plenary session to take steps `` to meet the population's requirements for foodstuffs more quickly.'' Meat, butter, sugar and other staples are rationed throughout much of the country and are in short supply elsewhere, even in the national capital, where there are numerous complaints in newspapers and on the streets that the food situation is worse now than when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed power in March 1985. The party also conceded people continue to wait `` for a sufficient amount of high-quality industrial goods to appear on sale,'' but it said a substantial amount of money is being spent to modernize light industry, and that some defense plants are being converted to civilian use. The platform also promised the party would `` do everything necessary ... to provide each family with a self-contained apartment or a house by the year 2000.'' Twenty percent of Soviet families now share living quarters with other, unrelated families. In some regions, families must live in dormitories because no apartments are available. Among other campaign promises, the party pledged: _ A new pension law increasing payments to retirees and establishing a uniform pension plan for industrial and office workers and collective farmers _ Overhaul of the judicial system and adoption of laws to strengthen individual rights `` an equality of everyone before the law. _ Expanding the rights of the nation's 15 constituent republics and stengthening their `` sovereignty'' within the Soviet system, which divides authority between the central government and the republics but traditionally has reserved most power inside the Kremlin In foreign policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> declared, `` The Cold War is retreating'' and said prospects are good for achieving a U.S.-Soviet pact on reduction of long-range nuclear weapons following implementation of a treaty eliminating intermediate-range missiles. `` We are doing all we can for an early settlement to the Afghan problem, for completion of Soviet troop withdrawal in keeping with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords,'' the platform said. A U.N.-brokered agreement calls for the last Soviet forces to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, but officials have indicated they may not meet that deadline. The Kremlin has been working to arrange a negotiated settlement of the protracted civil war.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unveiled a massive 35-foot globe, the centerpiece in <LOCATION> Geographica </LOCATION>, a high-tech multi-media science and geography exhibition two years away from being finished. Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> pressed a button to turn on the 1,550-pound globe, repeating her effort 25 years ago, when she helped dedicate the original globe and display in Explorers Hall at the magazine's headquarters Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> congratulated the society for its efforts to `` illuminate our understanding'' that the entire world is one society. The new globe, with a circumfrance of 35 feet, is composed of 54,739 square inches of epoxy resin and Fiberglas cloth painted in painstaking detail by artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, who spent 3,127 hours highlighting vegetation, deserts, national boundaries and undersea features. The globe is lifted on a cushion of air and can be rotated so any portion can face the audience. Lights display the movement of sunlight and shadow around the world. Occasionally work had to be sanded off and changed in progress, <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. For example, a visiting Indian official who saw the work informed the society that an area shown as a swamp had dried up into a salt lake _ so it was changed. And the configuration of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ice shelf had to be redone after a giant iceberg broke off. Geographic officials did take one precaution to save work in the event of political changes. National boundaries were applied with automotive pinstripe tape so that they can be relocated if necessary. The renovated exhibition area includes a 72-seat theater, a weather display including satellite readouts and a `` tornado'' in a tube, video shows depicting exotic cultures and both rare and common animals. While the exhibit wo n't be finished for two years, the society's president, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosvenor </PERSON>, said the public will be admitted starting Saturday to see the many displays already in operation

<HEAD>Airlines Begin Testing For Cross-Wiring In 737s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines began testing Thursday for faulty engine warning systems in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 airliners similar to one that crashed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A spokesman for one U.S carrier said 80 percent of its 737s had been tested with no problems found. Officials of other airlines said they were complying with the testing as a precautionary measure but expected to find no faulty wiring of fire and vibration warning lights that might mislead a pilot into shutting down his only good engine if the other one showed problems. That is one possibility being investigated in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where a British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> 737 crash killed 44 people Sunday. Investigators said the pilot was trying to land with his malfunctioning left engine after his good right engine was shut down. Tests on British-owned planes were completed Thursday under a <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> order that grounded them until the systems were checked out. No problems were reported. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` air worthiness directive'' issued late Wednesday did not order any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes grounded. It gave airlines with 292 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s and eight 737-400s until Sunday morning to conduct checks for possible cross-wiring. Each test takes about an hour. The British agency also ordered increased inspections of CFM56 engines on the planes, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had not taken that step. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials identified the affected airlines as <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. `` We found no anomalies or discrepancies,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Messing </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, reporting on inspections conducted by Thursday afternoon. He said 80 percent of the 55 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s flown by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> had been checked and the rest would be finished overnight. He said no flights were affected by the checks. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said the airline supported the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action `` even though we regard it as precautionary.'' She said all of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of 49 affected airliners had been tested for possible cross-wiring by test pilots after delivery from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> factory. United inspections were to be conducted Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at airports around the country, she said. American spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said inspections of some of the airlines' eight 737s were conducted Thursday, and the remainder would take place before Sunday. `` We have no reason to expect discovery of any abnormalities in these systems,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 At least 6,000 people starved to death in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in the past three months, but international airlifts of food and medicine have improved the situation, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Beuff </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> said he had reports of people dying at the rate of up to four a day in some areas of the south affected by a 5-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Reith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chuol </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> region, told reporters there were unconfirmed reports of 15 people dying there every day. No relief aid has reached the Upper Nile. <PERSON> Beuff </PERSON> said: `` Between last September and December, about 6,000 people have died in the south of the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but that is not the case anymore. ... People suffer but they are not dying. The situation is still not under control, but it is better than last year.'' Since the civil war began, nearly 2 million southerners have fled fighting in the countryside, trekking northward or going to government-controlled towns where they became dependent on relief food. Western relief officials estimate up to 560,000 southerners died from starvation, disease or fighting in 1988. Rebels led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a former army colonel, are fighting for greater autonomy for the south, most of whose people are Christian or animist, from Moslem-dominated northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Last summer, tens of thousands of southerners were isolated by heavy rains and thousands died of starvation. When the rains ended, several international airlifts started flying food and medicine to the towns in the Bahr el-Ghazal and <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> regions. Several operations by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> continue. As many as 80 people a day died last summer in <LOCATION> Bahr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Ghazal </LOCATION> towns.

City Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Figliola </PERSON> said the police complaint forms lodged Nov. 19, the day of the protest, and subsequent affidavits filed by prosecutors are `` completely barren'' of proof that the protesters knew they were on private property without permission or that they were told to leave the clinic grounds.

<HEAD>Official Sees Rebel ``Campaign of Terror'' in El Salvador''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> claimed Thursday that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s leftist rebels have had to resort to a `` campaign of terror'' against civilian targets because of declining popular support and increased resistance from the country's armed forces. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>, said the rebels have assassinated eight mayors in recent months, prompting 35 other mayors to resign. `` Denied success in the countryside, the guerrillas have embarked on a campaign of terror in the cities,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, whose remarks were made available by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels have met greater resistance from the armed forces and have had difficulty recruiting, forcing them to press men `` _ indeed children _ into a dirty war,'' he said. `` These are the tactics of a marginalized force driven to extremes by desperation,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, whose 3 -LCB- - year service as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bureau </ORGANIZATION> will end next week with the inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> He expects to practice law after spending about two months with the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative research group. Summing up what he described as the eight-year legacy of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> praised the democratic gains in the hemisphere and touched only briefly on the region's debt-induced economic crisis, which has led to declining living standards in most countries The return of economic growth, he said, `` will depend upon a pragmatic, open-ended search for solutions among creditors and debtors _ coming together as partners realizing their common stake in the outcome.'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also was sparing his in remarks on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, his major area of concern since his appointment in 1985. `` The <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that chose to become part of the Soviet bloc was not democratic,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` A democratic <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would have no use for a standing army of intimidating dimensions. Real peace in Central America depends on the prospects for democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' He made no reference to the Nicaraguan Contras, who have had unswerving support from <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. Expressing confidence that <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s fledgling democracy will be able to ride out the rebel challenge, he said the electoral process which began in that country six years ago led to a marked improvement in the security situation there. `` As the people voted in record numbers to put civilian leaders in charge, the military, freed to meet its professional challenge, began to reverse the progress made by the guerrillas. `` At the same time, a people who could see the prospects for peaceful change under elected governments could only reject the violence of the guerrillas as gratuitous and regressive.''

 <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, whose refusal to sit at the back of the bus sparked the modern civil rights movement, said the fight continues as she joined others Thursday honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. King rose to prominence after Mrs Parks' action in December 1955 in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, set the stage for a boycott and subsequent demonstrations that caught the nation by surprise. King was killed April 4, 1968, in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and what would be his 60th birthday Sunday is celebrated as a national holiday Monday; the celebration began with several events on Thursday. Mrs. Parks, 75, praised King as she answered questions on radio station <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION>. She said the struggle to attain rights is not over. `` I feel a kindred to the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as well as any other people who are being denied freedom, and as we try to free ourselves we must help those who are not free and are suffering all kinds of physical reprisals or denial,'' she told listeners. `` It seems as long as we do n't all unite together en masse that we will have to repeat marches over and over again and I do hope to live to know and see the day come when we will all be free citizens, to have any opportunity any other persons have to assume the responsibilities as others.'' At a breakfast at the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, several people were honored who exemplified King's meaning of taking `` the measure of a man'' at times `` of challenge and controversy.'' Those honored were <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, mother of a man killed on a <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, parkway after being chased by a gang of whites in December 1986; <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, president of an advocacy and service group helping welfare hotel residents; and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaine </PERSON>, who adopted a child with AIDS. The American Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held a meeting for 100 school children, about one-third <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON>, two-thirds black, to emphasize that the `` black and Jewish communities have long worked together in the movement for civil rights,'' the congress said. Attending were <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning, America''; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of `` Sesame Street''; former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Met Rusty Staub; city Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>; and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. `` The friendship between African-Americans and Jews, the alliance for social change, goes back a long way, well before the'60s,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> told the gathering. `` Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON> understood that when he spoke out against anti-Semitism and said that nobody should be anti-Semitic, least of all blacks.''

<HEAD>China To Meet With Vietnam On Cambodian War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has agreed to meet with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> next month for their first direct talks on the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict, a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance official said. The meeting will be held at the request of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which also plans direct talks with resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s son and representative in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance radio Wednesday. A text was obtained Thursday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supplies arms to the forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and two other guerrilla groups in the war against Soviet-supplied Vietnamese forces, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Asked about the reported Chinese-Vietnamese meeting, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> said on his return Thursday from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that he knew of it but could not divulge details. At a regular <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> briefing in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Thursday, spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> would say only that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will consider direct talks with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` at an appropriate time.'' He refused to elaborate. Both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have indicated they want to resolve the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict and thus clear a major barrier to Sino-Soviet rapprochement. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month to pave the way for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years, Chinese television reported Monday. In the resistance broadcast, <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is to withdraw its last troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> next month if it adheres to a U.N.-brokered accord, certainly will not continue to bankroll the Vietnamese forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` Moreover, as it is currently working to improve its relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and especially <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> just can not continue to help <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> occupy <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. He added: `` Moreover, I have learned that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to agree to negotiate with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> PRC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- accepts this Soviet proposal, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will call directly on <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> `` And I have just learned that the <ORGANIZATION> PRC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to receive <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s minister or deputy minister of foreign affairs early next February,'' he said. `` Based on all these points, it is not possible for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to maintain the presence of its troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> gave no details on the reported meeting. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, once allies, fought a brief but bloody border war in 1979 after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. They still periodically report border skirmishes. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has made a series of peace overtures to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in recent years, but <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> officials say the Chinese have rejected them and demanded first the unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Thursday, spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position that the key to the solution of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict `` lies in the genuine and complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date and effective international supervision.'' There is fear, however, that the strongest <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance group, the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, might seize power after a Vietnamese pullout and resume the ruthless repression that colored its rule of the country from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion. During that time, an estimated 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> executions, famine and civil unrest. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will totally withdraw by 1990 whether there is a settlement or not. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it withdrew 50,000 troops last year, leaving another 50,000 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>USDA Sets '89 Assessment at 1.12 Cents Per Pound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Flue-cured tobacco farmers and buyers each will be assessed 1.12 cents per pound for the 1989 crop, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The total of 2.24 cents covers a no-net cost assessment of 2 cents per pound and 0.24 cents to help cover the federal budget deficit. The total 1989 assessment will be down slightly from last year's 2.26 cents per pound. Department officials said they consulted with the Flue-cured <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the producer-owned association that handles the support program, before determining the 1989 assessment. The budget deficit assessment will be imposed according to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which calls for a reduction in the price support level by 1.4 percent or, alternatively, an assessment on producers to achieve an equal reduction in spending. Officials said the 1989 price support for flue-cured tobacco will remain at $ 1.468 per pound as announced on Dec. 15 for this year's crop

<HEAD>Many Rape Victims Blame Themselves, Fail To Report Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many college women raped by their dates or acquaintances do n't report the attacks because they blame themselves for losing control, a conference studying violence on the nation's campuses was told In addition, many women fail to realize they have become victims of rape or attempted rape, and seldom report the attacks even to their friends, experts said. `` What happens is that a guy pays for dinner, the movies, and he thinks you get what you get in marriage. They see it as a mini, quasi-marriage,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearinghouse </ORGANIZATION> on Marital and Date Rape. `` I do n't think we're getting rid of date rape until we get rid of that concept. In such cases, women, because of their upbringing, often blame themselves for being unable to control the situation, said Ms. X, who said she uses the X to protest the lack of attention given to women's historical role. About 250 psychologists, counselors, law enforcement officers, students and others attended this week's Third National Conference on Campus Violence here. The conference began Tuesday and ended Thursday. Several reports discussed at the conference indicated that from 13 percent to 25 percent of college women become victims of rape or attempted rape. As many as one in four female college students have been raped or have been victims of attempted rape by the time they reach the age of 21, according to a survey conducted on 32 campuses by Ms. <PERSON> Magazine </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and psychologist <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koss </PERSON>. The survey of 3,187 female and 3,000 male college students randomly selected in the 1985-86 school year found only 27 percent of the women deemed to have been victims of rape or attempted rape considered themselves crime victims. The study found 84 percent of the rape victims knew their assailants, but only 5 percent told police they had been attacked. Experts blamed the non-reporting on a `` rape culture'' that holds women primarily responsible for the outcome of relationships with men, even when they're overpowered. Lt. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> campus police's date rape prevention program, said no rape reports were filed with campus police in 1988 and only three were filed the previous year. Some 38,000 students attend the College Park campus. Many colleges and universities have started rape prevention programs. A leader in the effort is <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which instituted its Rape Education and Prevention Program in response to an alleged gang rape. Sue Green, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> effort, said her program teaches women to recognize a potential date rapist and teaches them how to fend off an attack. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, who runs a rape prevention program at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said the key to prevention is teaching college men that forcing sex on a woman during a date constitutes rape. Until men are more receptive, Ms. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s program stresses `` empowering strategies,'' including self-defense courses. She also suggests women use a buddy system where one woman agrees to stay sober and make sure the other steers clear of trouble.

<HEAD>Non White Males More Likely to Be Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The odds of becoming a murder victim are five times greater for non-white males born now than for the overall population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Americans born today have a 1 out of 177 chance of being murdered, while the risk for non-white males is 1 in 38, according to the study based on 1987 Uniform Crime Reporting statistics added to a computer model. If there were no murders, the average lifespan for all Americans would increase by almost 3 months, and the average lifespan for non-white males would increase by more than 11 months, the study found. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON>, a statistician with the Uniform Crime Reporting program, cautioned the predictions are based on 1987 figures and do not account for the possibility of substantial changes in the murder rates. `` We ca n't look into the future and say there are going to be so many murders in 1999,'' said <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON>, who compiled the report with statistician <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. `` This is based on what happened in 1987.'' In 1987, when the murder rate was 8.3 per 100,000 population, there were an estimated 20,100 murders. Of those, 9,510 were non-white, 7,436 of them non-white males. The study _ which calculated the probabilities of being murdered for newborns, those age 20 and those age 40 _ did not break down the non-white category for blacks, Hispanics and other minorities, <PERSON> Propheter </PERSON> said. The study predicted that while newborn non-white males have a one in 38 chance of becoming a murder victim, the chance for non-white females is one in 138. For both sexes, the chance is one in 60. For newborn white males, the chance is one in 204, while for white females, it's one in 437 for a combined chance of one in 277. For newborns of all races, the chance of being murdered is one in 122 for males, one in 324 for females and one in 177 for both sexes. As for men who already have reached age 20, non-whites have a one in 41 chance of being murdered, while whites have a one in 224 chance, for an overall chance of one in 136. For females who are now 20, non-whites have a one in 157 likelihood of being murdered, and whites have a one in 504 chance for a total probability of one in 376. The least likely to be murdered _ among the ages calculated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ are white women who are now 40. They have only a one in 931 chance of being murdered. Of all the groups now 40, the highest probability of being murdered remains non-white males, with a one in 97 chance. The overall murder rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has leaped 34 percent between 1967 and 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reported. In the past 10 years, the highest rate was 10.2 per 100,000 population in 1980, and the lowest was 7.9 per 100,000 in 1984 and 1985. The 1987 rate of 8.3 per 100,000 compares with 2.5 per 100,000 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In 1987, 36.7 percent of murders resulted from arguments, and 19.6 percent occurred in connection with felonies such as robbery, narcotics, sex offenses and arson, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Waskiewicz </PERSON>, an editor with the Uniform Crime Reporting unit. Meanwhile, 1.1 percent occurred from suspected felonies, 17.7 were miscellaneous _ including such things as the assailant being under the influence of alcohol or drugs _ and the circumstances for 24.9 percent are unknown, she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Thursday the people are angry and trouble is in store unless a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting next week does something to improve living conditions. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a shipyard electrician who founded the independent Solidarity union movement in 1980, said Poles are restive and fed up with high prices and shortages. `` We hope for God's sake that this plenum will go a little bit farther than its own nose,'' He told a news conference in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. `` If it does n't, it will be like a shout of encouragement to society and to us all, and I do n't know where we will end up. `` I appeal for getting out in front of society's demands. If not, I'm really afraid.'' The meeting Monday and Tuesday of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to produce confrontation between conservatives and those willing to recognize Solidarity and negotiate with the opposition. Solidarity was legal after its birth in the labor turmoil of August 1980 as the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc. It was suppressed and outlawed after the imposition of martial law in December 1981. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity wants to avoid unrest. `` We want it to be quiet ... both for the side of Solidarity and the government ... to get ready for talks, for attempts at solutions,'' he said. `` So we've given plenty of time. `` Unfortunately I am worried because there have been more and more days, but no more solutions. ... There are price hikes, but there is a lack of effect of reforms. ... Society is so tired, so fed up with it.'' He said he had expected protests to begin in April if nothing was done, `` but it may happen sooner. Let's hope we can avoid it. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> really does n't need it.'' A rally of several thousand Solidarity supporters was held Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> works. He mentioned that during the news conference, along with minor work stoppages or strike threats at various plants in the past few weeks. In an appeal for unity, he said: `` If we start jumping out in different places over different problems it will be anarchy, and it will be a reason that may be used to strike against -LRB- the union's -RRB- mainstream, to break, dissolve and destroy it.''

<HEAD>President Calls For Major Overhaul, Cleanup Of Atomic Arms Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday recommended spending $ 81 billion over 20 years to modernize the government's crippled nuclear arms factories and to begin cleaning up the nationwide trail of waste left by four decades of bomb-making President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not know whether he would support the proposal, which was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The plan includes closing four nuclear materials plants, consolidating work at other facilities and building two reactors to make a radioactive gas vital to continued production of nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the blueprint `` will enable the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a long-term approach to modernization rather than a piecemeal response to the problems within the nuclear weapons complex.'' The cost of modernizing the aging weapons-making plants through the year 2010 would be at least $ 52 billion, the report said. Cleanup costs over that period would total $ 29 billion, although the report said environmental repairs would have to continue far beyond 2010. There are 17 major plants in 12 states. These figures are in addition to normal operating costs over the next 20 years which, combined with the modernizing and cleanup costs, would total $ 244 billion. The cost estimates underscore the difficulties facing the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has pledged to maintain the nation's nuclear deterrent while protecting the environment and cutting government spending to balance the budget. Coincidentally, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent his recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the same day that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominated retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for developing, building and testing the nation's nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference he did not feel bound by the recommendations in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s report and indicated he would make no decisions on the weapons plants problem until after he and <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had studied the security implications. `` I think there's a risk, if we imprudently go forward, until he and I have had a chance to take a hard look,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was trained in nuclear engineering during a 1958 stint at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> _ one of the military-related nuclear weapons facilities. Concern over the nuclear weapons complex heightened last fall after the last of the nation's tritium-producing reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was shut down for safety reasons. Tritium is a short-lived gas that is vital in nearly all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear warheads. Pentagon officials have expressed concern that unless at least one tritium-making reactor is restarted soon the nation's nuclear arsenal could be weakened. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said it was unlikely the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors would be operating before the end of the year. The unclassified version released publicly did not say whether that would be soon enough to avoid a tritium shortage. It appeared to suggest, however, that even after costly safety and technical improvements, the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facilities would be unable to supply enough tritium. `` In spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable production efficiencies,'' the report said. The report specifically recommended: _ Investing $ 400 million to improve safety and technical operations at the Rocky Flats plutonium-processing plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and then spending $ 6.1 billion to close down the plant and transfer its operations to other sites _ Phasing out all nuclear materials-processing work at the Hanford Plant near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, between 1995 and 2000 A cost estimate was not made available. This plant, opened in 1944, was one of three original <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Project sites responsible for producing plutonium, including the material used in the bomb that destroyed <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. _ Shutting down the Feed Materials Production Center at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and shifting its operations elsewhere The report gave no specific cost figure and did not say where the Fernald activities should be moved. This plant, which makes uranium metal cores used in nuclear reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, has drawn fierce public opposition due to leaks of uranium dust into the atmosphere and toxic chemicals and uranium into wells used for drinking water. _ Transferring the nuclear waste-recovery operations of the Mound Plant, near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, to other unspecified <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> weapons plants at a cost of $ 255 million, starting in 1995 The plant's main work _ producing small explosive devices and timers for nuclear weapons _ would continue at the same site. _ Building two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium The report said the preferred sites would be at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. It estimated the combined cost at $ 6.6 billion.

 A Canadian cargo plane crashed and exploded in a fireball near a row of houses Thursday, killing the two pilots aboard and setting nearby woods afire, authorities said. `` We thought we were dead. That's how close it was,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, who was in his home a few hundred yards from the crash site. `` We've got debris all over the roof and everything.'' No one on the ground was injured, and no homes suffered serious damage. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonasson </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, said pilots from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> were the plane's only occupants. <PERSON> Jonasson </PERSON> declined to release their names until families had been notified. A small quantity of explosive and corrosive materials were aboard the plane, but they posed no environmental hazard, <PERSON> Jonasson </PERSON> said. The twin-engine plane took off from <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and crashed at 4:45 a.m. in a heavily wooded area about a half-mile away, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, acting aviation director for <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> described it as `` a fireball coming right at the side of my house.'' The explosion set fire to about 100 yards of wooded area, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowell </PERSON> of the Butler Township Fire Department. Several witnesses reported seeing a fireball in the air before the crash. Several hours after the crash, broken limbs and branches surrounded the smoldering wreckage and small fires continued to burn, although they were later extinguished. Boxes and other cargo littered the area. Two bodies were discovered at the site, one in the wreckage of the <LOCATION> Hawker-Siddley </LOCATION> turboprop and the other nearby, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chief investigator for the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coronor's office. The plane, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, was carrying cargo to <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an air freight courier service with a hub at the Dayton airport. It was at least 9 years old. Airport officials said they were unsure how long the aircraft was in the air following takeoff. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, an Emery employee, saw the plane go down as he was getting off work at the airport. `` It was kind of like just going across the horizon, and then it just blew,'' he said. `` It was just a big ball of fire.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitz </PERSON>, another Emery employee, said the plane appeared to burst into flame shortly after it cleared the runway.

 A cockpit recorder recovered by an underwater robot from the year-old wreckage of a South African Airways <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 nearly three miles deep in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> could provide the latest clue in a $ 6 million effort to determine cause of the crash that killed 159 people. The recorder's tape, recovered from the ocean last week, was taken Thursday by South African investigators to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, where it was copied for use by the investigators. Safety board officials said they only provided equipment for processing the tape and would have no role in playing, transcribing or analyzing it. The Unites States is providing the technical assistance at the request of the South African government. Meanwhile, search continues in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for other evidence in the Nov. 28, 1987, crash, including the flight data recorder, which would include technical information on the last few minutes of the flight. The cockpit tape, which officials said was flooded but has been cleaned and dried, records all talk and other noise in the cockpit. <ORGANIZATION> Eastport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marlboro </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which has been involved in deep-water recovery of wreckage of the space shuttle Challenger as well as other air crashes, retrieved the recorder last Friday from a depth of 14,800 feet with its $ 5 million `` remote recovery vehicle'' known as Gemini 6000. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, president of the company, said in a telephone interview that the plane `` looks like it went in intact and hit at a high rate of speed.'' He said recovered parts show evidence the plane may have been on fire. The South African government has refused to release contents of a control tower tape of conversation with the airliner pilot, who officials earlier said reported smoke in his cockpit before the crash. The government says contents of the conversation `` might be misunderstood or cause embarrassment.'' The airliner was on a flight from <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, when it disappeared near the island of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION> where it was to make a scheduled landing. Only 11 bodies were recovered and it took two months to locate the wreckage which <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said is strewn over a square mile of deep ocean. The victims included Taiwanese, South Africans and Japanese. The recorder box, about a foot square, was found lying by itself and was picked up as the Gemini was preparing to bring a larger piece of the aircraft to the surface, <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said.

 As many as 2,000 Nicaraguans now able to leave <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> because of a judge's order likely will come to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> this week, taxing the capacity of local government, officials said Thursday. Earlier this week, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> issued a temporary restraining order lifting an immigration policy that restricted immigrants to the area near the Mexican border. Officials there say that probably 5,000 exiles are affected, and a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> shelter official, <PERSON> Cristobal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, said the city will probably have 2,000 new arrivals by the weekend. Managers of bus stations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> told reporters that 95 percent or more of the Nicaraguans who left there Wednesday were going to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Permission was given to 739 exiles to leave <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> on Wednesday. As the buses pulled into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Wednesday and Thursday, hopeful Nicaraguans climbed off, eager to reunite with their families and find jobs. But city officials, who originally thought they would spend this week getting ready for the Super Bowl, say the aliens may not find the haven they expect. `` The inn is full,'' City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, home now to more than 250 immigrants. And those already there must be out by Jan. 25 _ when the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> baseball team will arrive for spring training. The judge's order in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was to relieve the conditions of aliens stuck there for weeks, many living in squalid conditions. Now they can stay wherever they like while they wait for their cases to be reviewed, and many have chosen <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Avino </PERSON> said some county land is being cleared for as many as 60 trailers, which will provide temporary housing. New immigration rules are responsible for much of the confusion surrounding this latest influx of immigrants, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In the past, those who arrived illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were entitled to work permits if they could not be interviewed about their applications for asylum within 60 days. But applicants now must get a favorable ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> before getting a permit. `` What people do n't understand that come here illegally today is that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed employer sanctions,'' said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. `` Without the work permit, the employers are not going to chance getting into trouble.'' Many of the aliens said they headed to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because they had heard the city was supportive of them. `` Throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, they kept on telling us about <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> stadium,'' said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>. He passed through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> on Sunday and arrived in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> by bus Wednesday. `` So I came here. But I thought everybody could enter.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> and 14 others were locked out of the stadium Wednesday night. He said he spent much of that night walking the streets, looking for a place to stay.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> completed his Cabinet on Thursday, picking retired naval chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, an expert on nuclear power, as energy secretary and appointing former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to help lead an `` all-out war against drugs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' experience would serve him well in devising a strategy for a multibillion-dollar cleanup of the nation's aging and increasingly unsafe nuclear weapons plants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not try to tone down <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has a reputation for being blunt and blustery. `` I'm not going to ask him to renounce that vim and that vigor and that determination that made him a howling success'' in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker who has tried to quit and failed, vowed he would give up his habit before beginning his new job. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., praised <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> for his `` reputation for being tough and for confronting issues head on'' but said he was concerned about <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s lack of law enforcement background <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in the past `` has been critical of our public school system.

I hope is is forthcoming with creative ideas. He must take bold initiatives and generate new resources to solve the drug crisis in our nation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his personnel choices at a news conference shortly before convening the first informal meeting of his Cabinet across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the government guest home. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted Cabinet chiefs `` to think big ... to challenge the system ... to adhere to the highest ethical standards.'' And he said, `` I'm going to tell them I do n't like kiss-and-tell books.'' `` I do n't mind differences being aired,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I want them to be frank, I want them to fight hard for their position.'' Yet he said he expected them to support his decisions once they're made Replying to a question, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` not entirely'' comfortable with the cost of his inauguration, which could reach $ 25 million. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I have no apologies for the way we're doing it at all'' because the country deserves a celebration like the inauguration every four years <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who takes office Jan. 20, acknowledged that he faces huge costs both in the cleanup of nuclear weapons facilities and the crisis of the savings and loan industry. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who during the campaign promised not to raise taxes, said he would solve both problems `` within the confines, the parameters of the commitment I made to the American people.'' In introducing <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm committed to solving the problems that exist within our atomic energy-defense complex.'' He refused to embrace the recommendations of a report sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> calling for spending $ 81 billion to modernize the nuclear weapons complex over the next two decades and the closing of four major facilities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to review all options before devising an energy policy `` that clearly will include the safety and cleanup'' of the nuclear plants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said development of nuclear power for domestic as well as military needs was `` not at all incompatible'' with safety and environmental concerns. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> he wanted him to consider choosing a deputy with experience in the oil and gas industry, but said he would not impose that choice. Trying to reassure <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> producers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said they would have a president who knows the oil and gas industry well. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, asked how he would shore up oil prices, replied, `` You're touching me in an Achilles' heel. I'm not an expert in this area.'' He said, however, he was a fast learner. Acknowledging that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has been closely identified with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s conservative wing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that his new `` drug czar'' would have to work with Democrats and Republicans alike. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that `` everybody has critics, particularly people who try to do anything.'' He promised to pursue his new job with `` great seriousness and humility.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` This drug business is a serious business and this government, this administration intends to take it seriously.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was taking the energy post with a commitment to make sure `` safety is never subverted -LRB- and -RRB- the environment is adequately protected'' while nuclear energy is developed. On other topics raised by reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Defended his decision to attend the funeral of Japanese Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, though he said that if someone had raised the possibility of his current situation after his plane was shot down by the Japanese in 1944, `` I would have found that hard to believe. _ Applauded a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> announcement that that nation would reduce stocks of chemical weapons and said, `` I'm glad the Soviets have joined us in that We've been doing that for some time.'' Regarding international pressure on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to not produce chemical weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` My view is that I will follow on what this administration has been doing to try to find verifiable ways of eliminating these things.'' _ Said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil reserves are not threatened by labor unrest in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil fields and saluted the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> president's `` very bold'' crackdown on the oil workers union <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, chief of naval operations until 1986 under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is a nuclear warfare expert whose name had not been widely mentioned until recently as a possible candidate for the energy post. He was chairman of a presidential commission on AIDS that last year called for new laws to protect victims of the deadly disease from discrimination. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 45, the blunt-spoken education chief under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a leader of conservative forces, left government last September to lecture and write. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a hard time filling both the energy and drug posts. After a quick start in naming his Cabinet, he now winds up with the modern-day record for lateness in completing his senior appointments. The mark had been held by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who completed his Cabinet on Jan. 8 _ four days ahead of when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised to include women and minorities in his Cabinet. He will begin his presidency with a Cabinet of 13 men and one woman, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at Labor. <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, picked as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, has Cabinet rank but is not an official member of the Cabinet.

<TEXT>
 A letter signed `` Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'' that reached the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday claimed responsibility for the bomb planted on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. There was no evidence that the letter, which used the British spelling `` defense,'' came from the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We think the moment has come to disclose to the world from which side the bomb was placed which destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 from Panam,'' the typewritten letter said. `` We, a radical group of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, take the responsibility for this action.'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a spokesman who returned a call to the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said: `` Anyone could type a letter. It was not us. ... Why would we or any other Jewish group bomb an American plane?'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said his group now is called the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The plane blown up by a bomb Dec. 21 was a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, not a 737. The letter said the bomb was planted `` by our fighters in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'' to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision a week earlier to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It bore a Dutch stamp and a Leeuwarden postmark. Another postmark had been added in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, apparently because it was insufficiently addressed and required rerouting. `` We are firmly decided to continue our attacks on U.S.A. objects until the American Government returns from its detestable policy,'' it said. `` We mean the condemnable friendly connections with our enemy, the P.L.O.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said it was investigating the claim. Comments by police in <LOCATION> Leeuwarden </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, cast doubt on the letter's authenticity. A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been previous cases of Dutch citizens making false claims of responsibility for violent incidents. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON>, an expert at the independent <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrorism </ORGANIZATION>, also was skeptical. If the motive was the U.S.-PLO connection, he said, it would have been impossible to prepare and plant a sophisticated bomb in the few days between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> announcement and the crash. <PERSON> Geldard </PERSON> also said he doubted the <ORGANIZATION> JDL </ORGANIZATION> had access to the plastic explosive Semtex, which officials say probably Semtex was used for the bomb. All 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground were killed. The Jewish Defense League was founded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1960s by Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and pursues a militant anti-Arab line. An Iranian group also claimed responsibility for the bombing in two telephone calls to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, calling it retaliation for the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet in July by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he intends to support Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and, at the same time, push for peace talks between the rebels and the Marxist government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confirmed he had sent a letter to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> last week on the occasion of the signing of a U.S.-mediated agreement for the pullout of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` I want to join you in welcoming this great diplomatic achievement, which holds out so much hope for the Angolan people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the letter.

Until then, `` my administration will continue all appropriate and effective assistance to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the letter said. In brief comments at a news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` clearly in expressing determination to support <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and urge at the same time reconciliation between <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, I'm for that policy and I want to try and enhance it.''

<HEAD>Polls Show Support For Bilingual Signs, Free Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most Canadians believe bilingual commercial signs with messages in English and French should be allowed in the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, according to a Gallup poll published Thursday. The poll, published in the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, also found growing support for the Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement. According to the survey, 85 percent of all Canadians and 61 percent of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> residents favor bilingual signs. Tensions have increased in the predominantly French-speaking province since December, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> ruled that a provincial law requiring all signs to be only in French was unconstitutional. The provincial government overrode the ruling and issued compromise legislation that allows bilingual signs indoors but still requires all outdoor signs to be in French only. Gallup said the poll surveyed 1,021 Canadians Jan. 4-7 and has a margin of error of 3 percent. Supporters of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s language restrictions argue that the province is an island of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> culture in English-speaking <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and entitled to protect its special qualities. Power in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> shifted from the English minority to the French, which make up 81 percent of the population, during the 1970s, a tumultuous decade of separatist sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a sovereignty referendum in 1980. The law requiring all commercial signs to be in French was passed in 1977. The Globe and Mail, which calls itself <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s national newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday that <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> `` has received, and deserves, strong criticism for his decision on the language of commercial signs in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. ... There is a danger, however, in raising the temperature on this issue.'' The Gallup poll also found increased support for the Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement since the Nov. 21 election that cleared the way for the deal. According to the poll, 45 percent of Canadians support the agreement, under which all tariffs between the two nations will be eliminated within 10 years. Before the election, which hinged mainly on free trade, Gallup found that 34 percent of Canadians supported the pact. The latest poll indicated that 29 percent oppose it, down from 41 percent before the election. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won its second consecutive majority government in the election, and he signed the trade pact with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January 1988.

 Prosecutors arrested a senior government party lawmaker on corruption charges Thursday in their investigation of alleged abuses under the authoritarian rule of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hak-bong </PERSON>, a member of parliament from the party in power, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was charged with taking bribes and with aiding corrupt relatives of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> while he was <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s chief presidential secretary. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> served as a top official at government security organizations after helping <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power with military backing in 1980. His was the first such arrest of a government lawmaker accused of corruption.

 <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> may have trouble finding something in vaults, but not <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tax collectors. The state's top court Thursday upheld the city's authority to collect taxes from the owners of underground vaults that extend beneath public streets and sidewalks. Unlike <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>'s vault, which <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> found empty in a nationally televised program, there's money in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> vaults. The city is owed an estimated $ 20.3 million in back taxes dating to 1962, according to the city <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Court of Appeals ruled against a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> property owner who complained that he should n't have to pay a $ 250,000 tax bill on his vault because he did n't use it. `` It's the biggest crime in the world,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, owner of the $ 20 million building. There are 14,616 underground vaults in the city, said <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallarico </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1962, the city has imposed a yearly tax of $ 2 per square foot on the vaults, some of which are `` cavernous,'' she said. `` It's the biggest bargain for storage space in town, we think,'' <PERSON> Tallarico </PERSON> said. Many property owners, however, complained they did n't even know they had the vaults until they received a tax bill. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the basement of his building is used to store furniture for an <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> franchise, but the vault has been unoccupied since it was flooded in the 1960s. The finance department said the vault is taxable unless it is rendered unusable by a wire mesh screen or sheetrock partition with an opening no larger than three feet by three feet. All seven <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judges said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> could be taxed because he did n't follow these rules. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the entrance to his vault is barricaded by cinderblocks. `` How can they say a chicken-wire fence is more inaccessible than cinderblocks?'' he said.

<HEAD>Many States Expanding Medicaid Coverage, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many states, in spite of their own tight budgets, are adding benefits to their Medicaid plans and expanding eligibility beyond federal requirements, a report by a federally funded health-policy research group said Thursday. The favorites among optional coverages being added are maternity-related benefits, according to the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They see there is a potential payoff -LRB- touted by -RRB- all those studies that show when you invest in prenatal care, you're going to lower the costs later on by producing healthier babies,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipson </PERSON>, senior research associate at the project. `` That's been a pretty easy sales job on states,'' she said. Since September 1987, legislatures in 19 states have added funds to their Medicaid programs to cover new services for pregnant women, the report said. In addition, by August 1988, some 45 states had expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and infants, although seven of the states wo n't implement the new standards until this year, the report said. These moves came in advance of changes in federal law that will require states to cover infants and pregnant women at or below 75 percent of the federal poverty level by July 1 and up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level by July 1, 1990. Other benefits being added by states include expanded coverage for hospice services, community-based long-term care, prescription drugs and dental services, the report said. `` No state reported making any significant cuts in benefits'' during the period studied, which was September 1987 through December 1988, the report said. States also are making changes in their administration and management of Medicaid programs to control costs, the report said. Last year, 12 states changed the way they review elective admissions to hospitals. Other states are encouraging enrollment in health maintenance organizations. The report offers no conclusions or recommendations, but <PERSON> Lipson </PERSON> said it `` disputes the notion that cost-savings and innovation only come from the private sector.'' The Medicaid program is funded by the federal and state governments and is administered by the states. The total cost of the program _ all federal and state funds _ was $ 52 billion in fiscal 1987. <PERSON> Lipson </PERSON> said she had no figure for the number of recipients who would be added to the Medicaid rolls as a result of the changes being made by the states. However, she noted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 budget proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> estimated that Medicaid would serve 25.7 million people, compared with 23.9 million currently The project is funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

A <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman denied the report and said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> still is working on a new peace proposal. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> reiterated on Thursday that he will not visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> unless that country agrees to an international peace conference on the Palestinian conflict. `` All countries of the world except <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' have accepted such a conference as the proper framework for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. A conference, under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, would bring together concerned parties and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> say the conference should lead to direct Arab-Israeli talks. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other regional problems when he visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office on Jan. 20. Asked about prospects of his visiting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> replied: `` I can not visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> particularly after Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> announced he will not make territorial concessions and does not accept an international peace conference. He is not giving something in return or -LRB- paying -RRB- a price for my visit, and we will not go there to have tea and coffee or to have a good time.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has refused to relinquish any Arab territory Israeli forces now occupy: the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, all seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signed the Camp David accord in 1978 and established diplomatic relations, but <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has not visited <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since taking office in 1981. In <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, the state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> said a new plan by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and to his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> attributed the report to an unidentified source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that it described as `` close to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. administration.'' The paper said the plan proposed `` a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference hosted by the superpowers'' and talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and `` Palestinians to be elected in the occupied territories.'' At the end of a three-year autonomy _ two years less than the autonomy under the Camp David accords _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposed a confederation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and allowing Palestinians and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> an access to the sea, it said. Under the plan, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would be linked economically in a way similar to that of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and a joint authority should be created to explore water and soil, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> said. The Camp David accords were a tripartite framework for an overall Arab-Israeli settlement that was signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1978. It was rejected by other Arab nations. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yosi </PERSON> <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> report was `` just speculation. Nothing formal has been released, although the prime minister is considering many plans based on Camp David. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Sunday to meet with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` No peace plan was presented by Mr. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is now working on a plan to be presented to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in March, but nothing has been completed yet,'' <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said the plan would contain `` no peace conference, but there could be a ceremonial opening by the superpowers or an initiative by the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.''

 The space agency, scarred by the Challenger accident in which the first `` teacher in space'' was killed, announced Thursday it will no longer carry non-astronauts or other non-essential personnel on the space shuttle. Passengers have in the past included a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> prince, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The new policy covers members of the news media, who were in final competition for a ride on the shuttle at the time of Challenger; and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a backup to <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, the teacher who was among the seven people killed when the spacecraft exploded in January, 1986. `` The Challenger accident marked a major change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronauts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said in a policy statement. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and interested external parties, domestic and internatijonal, must reexamine previous understandings, expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.'' The agency said flight opportunities generally will be limited to professional astronauts and payload specialists essential for mission requirements while <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> works to improve the reliability of the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog. The new policy establishes an additional category _ `` space flight participants.'' It embraces those `` whose presence on board the space shuttle is not required for operation of payloads or for other essential mission mission activities, but is determined by the administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to contribute to other approved <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> objectives or to be in the national interest.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., was aboard in January 1986, at the invitation of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator Both hold positions important to the space program on congressional committees and the official explanation was that the flights were important to their oversight responsibilities. In 1985, shuttle passengers included <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Saud </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vela </PERSON>, a Mexican. They were aboard, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, to `` observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-B communications satellites being launched for their countries. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal of providing such flight opportunities, it is devoting its energies to proving the shuttle to be safe and reliable. `` Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participants are not available at this time,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` When <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> determines that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight participant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space in fulfillment of space education plans.'' All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for payload or other mission requirements. Such added crew members have to be picked at least 12 months before the flight and first consideration will be given to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s own people.

<HEAD>Presidium Gives Disputed Region Special Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government gave special status Thursday to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a disputed region with a predominantly Armenian population, but kept it within the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet represented another attempt by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to ease tension over the area, focus of a struggle between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis that has led to 60 deaths in the past year. About 200,000 refugees have left <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which wants to annex it. The region is an enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, to which it was assigned in 1923. Martial law and curfews were imposed in many parts of the two <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics two months ago to quell ethnic violence. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's decision was made at a meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the government's highest executive body, convened by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to consider `` urgent'' issues. Unconfirmed reports had circulated for more than a month that the Kremlin would transfer <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to the Russian federation, largest of the 15 Soviet republics, in an effort to end the dispute. A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday, however, made clear it would remain within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The official news agency said the Presidium `` found it expedient to temporarily introduce in the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> autonomous region a special form of administration, with <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> retaining its status as an autonomous region incorporated in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.'' It did not describe the special administration, but said a decree would be published later. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said last week a special commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Politburo would meet Wednesday to consider the ethnic dispute, but there was no word that such a meeting had occurred. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the party chiefs of the two republics met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday and agreed to try to persuade people who fled ethnic violence to return home. Armenian residents of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> began agitating in February for annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and huge demonstrations for the cause were held in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, and other cities of the southern republic. In July, the Presidium rejected the annexation requests but announced a program of economic and other aid for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>.

 Time is running out for the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to approve a peacekeeping force that would be ready by the April 1 deadline to oversee <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s move to independence, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. The Security Council has been deadlocked for weeks over demands by its five permanent members that the cost of the force be cut. Also, the non-aligned members insist that the maximum force of 7,500 peacekeepers be dispatched. Council members continued to consult this week in an effort to reach a compromise, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. Plans for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> force call for up to 7,500 peacekeepers, 2,000 civilian administrators and 360 police to supervise <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence after 74 years of South African rule <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have estimated a peacekeeping mission that large would cost $ 600 million to $ 800 million, more than the combined cost of last year's peacekeeping activities. The five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ collectively are assessed 57 percent of the cost of peacekeeping operations. They have agreed that <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s operations should not top $ 450 million. They also have been studying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to cut the military component of the force. Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the secretary-general's special representative for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said Thursday that `` time is running out'' for the council to reach agreement Even if an agreement were reached by the end of the week, it would take at least until the end of February before <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committees could develop and approve budgets for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> force, he said. Until the budgets are in, his office can not complete plans for ordering equipment, supplies and transportation for the force, <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence is to begin April 1. Elections are to be held Nov. 1 for a constituent assembly, which is to draft a constitution and form a parliament. The non-aligned members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The other non-permanent members of the council are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence was part of a peace agreement that also calls for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent forces into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in July 1975 to support forces fighting guerrillas backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has begun withdrawing troops.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday disputed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media report that the airline's security was lax at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> even after the bombing of Flight 103. `` All I can say is that we have a security staff that uses the most modern methods,'' said airline spokesman <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosel </PERSON> from his office in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Passengers are also matched up with their luggage, and are given a list of questions to answer, including where they came from, whether they packed their luggage themselves, and so forth, and their passports are checked against their tickets,'' <PERSON> Kosel </PERSON> said. Asked if luggage brought on board by crew members also was checked, <PERSON> Kosel </PERSON> said: `` Yes, of course, everyone is checked.'' <PERSON> Kosel </PERSON> said the security staff was part of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary called `` Alert.'' ABC World News Tonight on Wednesday alleged that baggage handlers and others at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were not given a thorough background check, and that at least one <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security guard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said he had received only minimal training before going to work for the company. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> report came three weeks and a day after a bomb destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21. All 259 people aboard the plane and at least 11 on the ground were killed. Investigators are trying to learn who placed the explosives aboard the airplane, and where. The New York-bound flight began at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and changed planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kosel </PERSON> said, `` It appears now 99.9 percent sure that this did n't happen in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. British investigators have said the explosives ruptured the fuselage of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in the area of the cargo hold just forward of the plane's left wing. They have also said they suspect the bomb used was an explosive produced in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> called Semtex. Czech officials have agreed to send experts to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to assist in the investigation.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> traded shots on the basketball court Thursday night in a game followed so intently in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that radio appeals were made to taxi and bus drivers not to mix driving and listening. The dribble diplomacy was the latest sign of improving relations between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s closest <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> ally and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the main political and military backer of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies. `` The fact that our team is there and playing is quite an encouraging step,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Spokesman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheck </PERSON>. The viewing audience was huge for the first live broadcast from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in which underdog <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maccabi </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CSKA </ORGANIZATION> team 97-92. In a nation of only 4.2 million, more than 2 million people were watching at the last basket, according to TV managing director <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavin </PERSON>. Even Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, not a noted sports enthusiast, took time out to watch the game on a small portable set in his office. After the victory fans took to the streets shouting `` We won, we won!,'' and bus and taxi drivers beeped their horns `` It's a great victory for <LOCATION> Maccabi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, in the eyes of the world,'' Education Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> told the national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Over 1,000 <LOCATION> Maccabi </LOCATION> fans applied to go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but only about a dozen were granted visas. The late afternoon starting time cut rush-hour traffic to a trickle in major cities as workers raced home early to see the game. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s central Mahane Yehuda market closed three hours ahead of schedule. Some Israelis gathered in pizzerias and cafes to watch, cheering wildly at each basket. Nut stands and candy stores reported a booming business as sports fans bought up nibbles for the big game. <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefan </PERSON>, director of the electric company, appealed to viewers not to use water heaters and ovens during the game. He said power blackouts might occur because so many TV sets were on at the same time. In basketball-crazy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the sports interest for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> game since 1973 was a major factor But there was also an unmistakable sense of drama over the changing political climate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV opened its broadcast with a shot of the onion-domed <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> and a voice-over commentary by correspondent <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbel </PERSON> who said `` history is being made.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been without diplomatic relations since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when the Kremlin broke ties in protest of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seizure of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territory. The climate has warmed markedly since the Soviets sent a diplomatic delegation to take up residence in July 1987. Part of the reason for the improved Soviet image is attributed to steadily building contacts at the non-official level, including the visit of Soviet musicians, a leading poet and ordinary Soviet tourists. Cultural visits are particularly popular, not leastly because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has 250,000 immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said the rapprochement is motivated by the Soviet desire to play a role in any <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement and the necessity to convince <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> such a role can be constructive. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had conditioned Soviet participation on enlarged Jewish emigration and freedom of Jewish cultural life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as well as restoration of full diplomatic ties. `` Whatever hesitations we may have had in the past, they were concerned with the fact that many Jews who pursued Zionist activity have been imprisoned'' and emigration was restricted, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said Tuesday upon return from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` Most of that has disappeared,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> acknowledged. The two nations appeared to be moving steadily _ if slowly _ toward renewal of diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> announced Sunday the Soviet decision to upgrade the status of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and include political matters in its range of activities. Israeli Foreign Ministry officials say this means <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s envoys and their Soviet counterparts in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> will turn into de facto permanent diplomatic missions.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ended 1988 more than $ 750 million in the red mainly because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withheld its dues during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, according to figures obtained Thursday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contributor, owed $ 401.7 million, according to an advance copy of the 1988 annual financial figures obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. That figure equals 53.5 percent of the total arrears of the regular and peacekeeping budgets, according to the advance copy. The regular budget ended the year $ 394.9 million in the red, more than $ 40 million over the arrears at the end of 1987. Peacekeeping budgets ended 1988 $ 355.2 million in arrears. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had said it was withholding funds to protest anti-U.S. bias in the world body and inefficient administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in September he was satisfied with the progress of reforms at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to devise a schedule for repaying all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrears. Officials at the New York-based world body said the funding crunch had jeopardized the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> payroll and could undermine <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to field international peacekeeping troops, which won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize. `` We've spotted land, but are not yet ashore,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. `` Clearly, to successfully take on the many tasks now being given us by the world community, member states are going to have to start paying in full and on time, and these arrears must be reduced.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was responsible for $ 307.6 million, or about 77 percent of the arrears in the regular budget. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> owed $ 9 million, or 2 percent of the regular arrears. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was responsible for $ 172.1 million, nearly half the arrears in peacekeeping. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was responsible for $ 94.1 million, or 26 percent. Eighty-six of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through the end of 1988, a better showing than in the past. At the end of 1987, only 75 nations were paid up. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a nation with its own serious financial troubles, pleasantly surprised the world body in December by paying all its dues, $ 17.9 million, said <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtasaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general in charge of administration. The total regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget is about $ 880 million, of which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is assessed one-fourth and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 11.8 percent. In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 10 other nations owe more than $ 1 million to the regular budget: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, $ 33.9 million; <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, $ 7.9 million; <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, $ 5.2 million; <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, $ 4.3 million; <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, $ 4 million; <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, $ 3.5 million; <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, $ 3.1 million; <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, $ 2.8 million; <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, $ 1.4 million; and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, $ 1.2 million.

 Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said Thursday he believes former presidential aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> can be tried on cover-up charges without raising the national security concerns which undermined conspiracy and theft counts. `` The government's case no longer depends on proving that the proceeds of the Iranian arms sales constituted government property, or that by diverting those proceeds to the Contras, <PERSON> North </PERSON> embezzled them,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in a court filing. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> outlined the prosecution's legal theory of the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the event the conspiracy and theft charges against the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide are dropped, as expected. North's possible defenses to the charges, which focus largely on the coverup of various aspects of the Iran-Contra affair, `` are narrowly circumscribed,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in the court filing. `` The classified information problems affecting'' the conspiracy and theft counts `` should no longer be at issue,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s view differs sharply with that of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Last Thursday, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that `` classified information pervades the remaining charges as well.'' The independent counsel said the government will prove that <PERSON> North </PERSON> aided the Contras and then misrepresented his activities'' to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, obstructed a congressional inquiry into his activities a year later and then lied to the attorney general about details of the diversion of money to the Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also said the government need not establish <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motives for committing acts such as destroying and altering documents and misrepresenting his activities to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> may attempt to bring classified information into the case by saying that he had covered up because superiors directed him to or because everything he did was `` authorized and perfectly legal.'' In neither approach should North be permitted to bring up classified information, said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. On Monday, however, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that while motive does not determine guilt or innocence under the law, <PERSON> North </PERSON> does have the right to show that the activities he sought to cover up were not illegal. North might then seek to bring in some of the same classified information that led to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> abandoning the conspiracy and theft charges. `` No doubt <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motives were mixed,'' said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` To cover up activities in support of the Contras which the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might protest, to cover up prior lies, to avoid political embarrassment to the administration, or to avoid charges of illegality.'' However, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> added, `` the jury will not be asked to decide this case on the basis of North's motives, or the legality of the conduct he was covering up.'' The independent counsel last week gave up his pursuit of the conspiracy and theft of government property charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> because the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused to declassify portions of documents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said were needed to conduct a fair trial. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed declarations and a memorandum under seal with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that outlined the national security problem. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> may dismiss the two counts on Friday. Nine of the 12 counts that would remain focus on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s allegedly concealing from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> his efforts on behalf of the Contras In addition, <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

 Central banks fought off speculators and managed to knock the dollar slightly lower in wild foreign-exchange trading on Wednesday. Traders said there was concerted dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and perhaps others. `` It was very hectic. The market just sort of twisted and turned,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON>, vice president and manager of foreign-exchange trading at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. High <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates have made the dollar attractive to global investors, while the West German mark has been under heavy selling pressure because of low German interest rates. Central banks have been fighting the trend because of fears that currencies are becoming misaligned and could cause economic damage. Among other things, a strong dollar would hurt progress in reducing the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The dollar reached a three-month high of 1.84 marks in European trading before succumbing to central-bank intervention and finished the day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> between 1.82 marks and 1.83 marks. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.25 Japanese yen to a closing 126.95 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 126.15 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 125.78 yen from 126.33 Tuesday. The dollar fell against the British pound as well. Sterling fetched $ 1.7815, compared with $ 1.7643 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling rose to $ 1.7866 from $ 1.7649. Gold prices fell slightly. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where the day's trading begins, gold fell $ 2.70 a troy ounce to close at a bid price of $ 404.48 an ounce. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 403.50 a troy ounce, compared with $ 404.75 bid late Tuesday.

 Hundreds of Soviet Jews, given a rare chance by improved relations to wave the Israeli flag and proclaim their heritage, rocked a basketball stadium with cheers Thursday as Maccabi of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> edged the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> 97-92. `` This is joy, this is happiness,'' exulted <PERSON> Merab </PERSON> <PERSON> Detrokalashuvili </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Jew from the Soviet Georgian republic, hugging and kissing others in a crush of Jews at the army sports complex on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s west side. `` The Jewish nation is one nation,'' he said, clutching a blue-and-white <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag that he brought to the game. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, one of four American-born black players on the Israeli basketball team, put the game away for Maccabi with a short jumper from the left side in the final seconds. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a nation of 4.2 million people, more than 2 million were watching at the last basket, according to TV managing director <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Fans rushed outside shouting `` We won, we won!,'' and bus and taxi drivers beeped their horns Maccabi captain <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamshi </PERSON> and coach <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherf </PERSON> stressed that no incidents occurred on the court and none was evident in the stands or outside. <PERSON> Jamshi </PERSON> said the teams know and respect each other because they have played each other often in neutral settings. `` Relations are very good,'' he said. `` It's like a little war. We won the war and go home happy.'' The team's appearance in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a European Championship Cup game was the first by an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> basketball team in 15 years. The Israelis said they tried to keep out politics, but it proved impossible because of the recent history of poor Israeli-Soviet relations. `` It was not a regular game for us,'' <PERSON> Sherf </PERSON> said in a post-game interview. `` The players were very, very excited before and during the game.'' The Soviet champions will travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a return game in March. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the Middle East War of 1967. In recent years, under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it slowly has been seeking a thaw with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The last Israeli basketball team to appear in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, participants in the University Games, was jeered as it strode into <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in August 1973. Only the Soviet flag was hung above the central scoreboard Thursday. Maccabis owner <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizrahi </PERSON> said Soviet officials decided not to display an Israeli flag but such a display was not mandatory because the game was not between two national teams. Fans of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> team chanted `` Maccabi, Maccabi!'' and waved a dozen blue-and-white banners emblazoned with the Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>. At one point, several broke into an old <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> folk song, `` We've Brought Peace to You.'' Cheers got louder, and <LOCATION> Maccabi </LOCATION> fans jumped from their seats as <PERSON> Maccabi </PERSON> broke out to a 10-point lead as the game was reaching midpoint and then made it 71-51 with about 12 minutes left. The Soviets came storming back, led by guard <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON> and forward <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarakanov </PERSON>. The roar grew deafening when <PERSON> Tarakanov </PERSON> brought the Soviets to 93-89, with a jump shot from the free throw circle and then scored two free throws to make it 95-91 with about a minute left. <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> wrapped it up for the Israelis with his jumper shot, however. Soviet Jews said they had no trouble buying tickets. <PERSON> Detrokalashuvili </PERSON>, who said he plans to join his parents, sister and brother in Israeli in April, bought 20 tickets and distributed them to friends who came up from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> for the game. Four U.S.-born blacks play for Maccabi. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a black American Jew from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizen who has been on the team for 12 years. He came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a college student to play in the Maccabiah Games, an Olympic-type event for Jews across the world. <PERSON> Lavonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, has been on the team about eight years and became an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizen two years ago. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Magee </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and a team member for five years, and <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, are the professional team's two foreign players. With the exception of <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, who was born Jewish, the Americans were recruited for Maccabi out of college and are paid more than Israeli players.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations on Thursday broke off discussions on arms control talks because of a lingering dispute between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, Western diplomats said. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said East and West negotiators agreed to meet again on Friday. The 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, meanwhile, will continue to search for a way to break the impasse between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> over the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION>, the diplomats said. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> wants the port included in the new talks on cutting conventional forces across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because it alleges the port is a base for shipping arms to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> insists the port be excluded, since it is close to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which is not included in the new arms talks or in the 35-nation <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process on security and human rights. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to exclude the port and the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base of <LOCATION> Incirlik </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms talks. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> fears reopening the issue of <LOCATION> Mersin </LOCATION> also could change <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s mind over the air base, which it long sought to include in the new talks. The dispute threatens to block new East-West agreements on arms control talks and a landmark human rights accord. The arms talks are designed to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troops, tanks and airborne forces from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains deep inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They could begin as early as March, according to diplomats from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. But if the Greek-Turkish dispute is not solved by the end of this week, the new East-West arms talks can not be set before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office, diplomats say. The overall agreement at the 35-nation <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> review conference on security and human rights in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also would be at risk. The mandate for the new arms control talks is supposed to be part of the final document agreed on by the 35 nations at the conference, which began work in November 1986. A draft of the final document was presented last week, a day before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> removed a major obstacle by announcing they are willing to attend a 1991 human rights meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> on Thursday urged the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to make reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit a top priority, saying more reductions are needed to take pressure off international financial markets. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still importing large sums of foreign capital to finance its large twin trade and federal budget deficits. This flow of foreign capital, estimated at around $ 10 billion a month, means less money going into productive investments in countries outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said in a speech. `` Further reductions in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal deficit would take a lot of pressure off the international capital markets and help stabilize interest rates around the world,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> was asked during a question period following the speech how fast <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration need to act on the deficit problem in order to reassure jittery world financial markets. He said he realized `` it takes some time'' to work out governmental problems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` but I hope it will be a solution this year and not only in the last months as it was in 1987.'' In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration forged an agreement in December to lower the federal deficit following negotiations which had been prompted by the collapse of the stock market in October. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> met earlier in the day with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. He met with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> on Wednesday and is scheduled to meet Friday with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, nominated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his budget director. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> exchanged `` views on a wide range of issues that will confront the new administration.'' Officials said no decisions were reached on a proposed meeting between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its top economic allies, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is expected to attend such a meeting to assure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies the new administration plans to pursue <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies which have sought to stabilize the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar relative to other currencies. In his speech, <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made plain that he will continue to try to reduce the federal government deficit. He said Americans see that as the key to making more of their savings available for investment, to keeping prices stable and interest rates low and to reducing the need to get money from abroad. `` The very low savings ratio in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the effect of the budget and trade deficit necessitate a very high level of capital imports, which in the long run would cause serious problems,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 An Angolan who monitors a truce line on the Namibian border said Thursday there is an unpatrolled gap in the area to be checked for violations of a cease-fire between Angolan and South African forces. Five months after the shooting stopped, three of a scheduled 11 posts have not yet been established along a 600-mile stretch from <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> east to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Valeriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON>, second in command of the Angolan contingent on the joint commission. <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> said 11 posts were to have been set up by the end of September, after the truce was declared Aug. 8. He spoke to reporters at his camp near the <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> control point 570 miles south of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He said the unpatrolled sector runs from the town of <LOCATION> Cuangar </LOCATION> about 315 miles east to the Zambian frontier and includes the <LOCATION> Caprivi </LOCATION> strip. `` The presence of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces along the Angolan border is obstructing the establishment of the three final posts,'' he said. `` We believe they -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> -RRB- are continuing to support <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> from that area.'' Asked whether <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> had proof, he replied: `` No. We have suspicions.'' Guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports, have fought <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government since independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. South African troops have operated in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, helping <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and pursuing Namibian guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said Dec. 22 it had halted aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. Neither <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is involved in the truce or in the U.S.-mediated peace plan for southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has protested the failure to establish the three remaining posts, <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> said, at sessions of the joint monitoring commission that includes six members each from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and six <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The commission has met each weekday on the border about a mile from the Angolan camp. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s camp is just across the frontier in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured the territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I and has governed it since _ for the past 22 years in defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Under the three-way agreement signed Dec. 22, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 soldiers are to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by mid-1991 and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is to become independent after U.N.-supervised election. Under the cease-fire agreement, no significant movement of troops is permitted on either side of the border. Both <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> and 1st Lt. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> wore the orange armbands of the joint commission and carried sidearms. They talked with reporters in the shade of thorn trees in the camp next to the <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> dam on the <LOCATION> Cunene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms part of the border. <PERSON> Martinho </PERSON> said daily patrols by 22 Angolans and 22 South African soldiers have not found significant violations of the cease-fire. He said the Cubans, who are expected to have withdrawn 3,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sunday, do not take part in truce patrols. Few people live in the area. A helicopter flight from the Cuban-built airstrip at <LOCATION> Cahama </LOCATION> south to <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> revealed isolated huts, patches of corn and small herds of goats and cattle.

 The country's first woman <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member resigned Thursday after a prosecutor's report said she was `` strongly suspected'' of leaking confidential information to her husband about a drug inquiry. The announcement by Justice Minister <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> brings to a head this nation's biggest scandal in years, known as the `` Lebanon Connection.'' In her statement distributed by a staff member, Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said she was stepping down in the `` in the interest of a quick, unconditional and comprehensive'' investigation. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> acknowledged for the first time that `` seen today, the telephone call -LRB- to my husband -RRB- was a mistake I regret.'' She said keeping her post had become `` humanly and politically'' impossible. Last month, she announced she would resign at the end of February. Defense Minister <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON>, who also serves as Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s deputy, assumed the justice minister's post as caretaker until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approves her successor It is expected to do so within several weeks. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said Wednesday she did not believe she was guilty of wrongdoing. A prosecutor's preliminary inquiry into the leak, whose results were published Wednesday, said Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> was `` strongly suspected of violating an official secret in warning her husband to sever ties with a company under investigation in a major drug money-laundering scandal. The inquiry by special prosecutor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hungerbuehler </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> and two aides passed on details of a ministry file on the investigation of Lebanese-controlled <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trading </PERSON> <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON>, where her husband, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, quit as board member after the warning. Newspaper reports say he left the same day his wife called. She says she only passed on `` rumors'' she had discovered independently. A week after the call, prosecutors announced they were investigating the $ 1 billion money-laundering operation. <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> was among the companies and banks named by authorities as possibly involved, but no charges have been filed. In Thursday's statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said she had asked the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to take steps needed to lift her immunity from prosecution. She said she did so in the interest of a complete inquiry. `` I expect that this grave accusation will be resolved through a continuation'' of a public inquiry, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s resignation follows nationwide debate of the affair, which has generated domestic banner headlines for almost three months. Under Swiss law, a government official found guilty of violating an official secret can be fined or jailed for up to three years. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, 52, rated the most popular Cabinet member in a public opinion poll in December. She also served as deputy interior minister and Swiss vice president, an honorific post rotating annually among the seven ministers.

<HEAD>Driver Hoped Wind Would Extinguish Flaming Vehicle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A truck driver who drove his burning rig for nine miles on Interstate 5 hoping the wind would extinguish the fire was cited for reckless driving after the fiery wreckage closed the highway for three hours. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, told state police his brakes began smoking, then caught fire Wednesday night while his car-hauler descended from the <LOCATION> Siskiyou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> with a load of used cars. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he stopped at a rest area about 10 miles from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> border and tried to put the fire out with a fire extinguisher. When that failed, he got back into the truck and started driving again, police said. He finally stopped nine miles later, after the truck had become fully engulfed. The truck and its load of used cars were destroyed. Police said pieces of burning debris were scattered over a wide stretch of the freeway, the state's only major north-south highway, and the northbound lanes were closed for about three hours about the 10:30 p.m. incident. There were no reports of injuries and an estimate of damage was not available.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> broke federal laws by employing the son of a congressional colleague at a time that records show the son had sworn he was living in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offical said Thursday. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., are subjects of a preliminary investigation into <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s employment of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, who said he was living in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ and running for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> _ at the same time he was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll, the official said Department policy prohibited him from commenting further, said the official, who spoke only on condition he not be named. In a related development, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, also has written <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, who is the district's non-voting member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, asking for an explanation of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s employment, according to a congressional source <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> earned $ 21,398 while on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll from September 1987 through June 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also is looking into any connection between <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s employment of the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s employment of <PERSON> Lezli </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> aide. A month before <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON> was ousted from a job <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> gave her on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. After leaving the Public Works panel, Ms. <PERSON> Baskerville </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll, where she was directed to do legislative work on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION>, a private group of black businessmen that <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> chairs, according to a memo provided by <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> to his staff. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, in a statement released Thursday, said, `` On the advice of counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, while I have nothing to hide, I have nothing to say.'' `` It should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed by any law enforcement authorities, nor has anyone on my staff even talked to any law enforcement authorities,'' he added. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials investigating the matter do not have subpoena powers, according to sources familiar with the probe. In addition, congressional sources and others familiar with the investigation said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s staff director, refused to meet with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who attempted to question him. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter. The federal investigation began last month after The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll although he had submitted a sworn affidavit to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> elections officials stating he had met state requirements by living continuously for two years in the state legislative district he sought to represent. That period covered the time he was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> and the younger <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> first said that he had worked on a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> statehood bill, but <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> later conceded he rarely worked in <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s office and did little more than stuff envelopes while he was there. When contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Thursday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said he was unaware of the investigation. He refused further comment. Rep. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s letter asked <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> to explain how he had come to hire <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, what duties <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> performed, and whether <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had regularly reported to work, the congressional source reported. House rules require that a congressional employee must report regularly to work. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> could not be reached for comment on his letter. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conducts a `` preliminary investigation'' after an initial determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed examination. Ordinarily, a report resulting from a preliminary investigation is sent to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office for review. A decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury. In the <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> case, the preliminary investigation will determine whether Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> will seek the appointment of a special prosecutor, the procedure required when members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are involved.

 West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said Thursday that `` bad feeling'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over alleged Libyan construction of a chemical weapons plant has been cleared up. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> noted his government had initially rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that a German company had played a major role in the construction of the alleged <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> chemical weapons plant south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. `` In recent days there has been some additional information after the first -LRB- West German -RRB- investigation proved nothing,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said in a question-and-answer session with reporters and officials. `` You can read in the papers that there is now some suspicion that it is possible that some international trade company with a subsidiary in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and possibly also a German company with a subsidiary,'' were involved, he said. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said some exports may have left <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> supposedly destined for another country, but had wound up in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` This is possible, but we can not give a final judgment because we have -- and this will be done very urgently in these days -- to clear whether exports, if they happened this way, were against the law,'' he said. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said it would have to be determined if the exports included `` sensitive components which would be used for weapon production'' or were pure civilian products not subject to embargo. He said it remained important for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` share your deep concerns fully about the possible buildup of chemical weapons especially in countries which pursue a very dangerous international policy.'' `` We are generally against it and we are very sensitive as you when we look to third countries,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mayor's wife who died in a Dec. 1 rail crash in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> was most likely the victim of sabotage by a leftist guerrillas, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> was killed and her husband, <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, was injured Dec. 1 when the rail car they rode crashed near <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, 355 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. She is the fourth American known to have been killed as a result of the Maoist Shining Path's nearly 9-year-old insurgency. Peruvian authorities at the time said saboteurs wedged a 10-inch steel rod into the tracks, which caused the single car to derail and tumble down a 250-foot sloped ravine. They said either guerrillas or workers supporting a Communist-led general strike caused the accident, which also killed <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, the wife of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, and severely injured the mayor. The embassy said Thursday that Peruvian investigators since have reached the opinion that the guerrillas were behind the attack. Local officials believe <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> was the rebels' most likely target, the embassy said. The crash occurred on <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>'s outskirts as the two couples, along with <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> councilman <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> and five other people, were en route on a daylong outing to the ancient <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> citadel of Machu Picchu, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> to participate in a sister city ceremony, returned home with his wife's body a few days after the accident. He signed the <LOCATION> Cuzco-Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> accord and vowed to help <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> any way he could. More than 12,000 people have died in the Shining Path's fight to topple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install Marxist rule. Analysts said foreigners generally have not been targeted for attacks by the rebels, but the foreign death toll has risen recently. Eight foreign tourists including two Americans were killed in 1986 when rebels bombed a train carrying passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Machu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picchu </ORGANIZATION>, and one American and two French agricultural advisors were killed last year by highland guerrillas.

 <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> seems of another time, a time when <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Odetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> celebrated freedom and the spirit of man, and defied brutality and repression with their songs and anthems. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose self-titled debut album has been nominated for six Grammys, is of this age and her songs take a hard, cold look at poverty, racism, inequality and human relations. She is uncompromising, tough and compassionate. `` I think people look at the world in many different ways and choose to see what they like,'' she said in an interview last year with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think lots of people ignore some of the harder issues, the more unpleasant things. I do n't think I harp on them.'' Her LP opens with `` Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that tells of `` standing in the welfare lines Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation Wasting time in the unemployment lines Sitting around waiting for a promotion Poor people gon na rise up And get their share Poor people gon na rise up And take what's theirs.'' Until `` <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'' hit record stores last April, the 24-year-old poet-singer-songwriter-folksinger was one of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area's best kept secrets. As an anthrolopolgy major at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, she performed in coffee houses and clubs, and was a local hit. The LP, with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae, enchanted millions more. It has sold over 4 million copies and has been nominated for album of the year and best contemporary folk recording. The single, `` Fast Car,'' has been nominated for best song and record of the year, and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> herself is up for best new artist and best female pop vocalist. `` Fast Car'' was a No. 1 hit and tells of a high school dropout who works to supports her alcoholic father and who wants to escape it all with her unemployed boyfriend: `` You got a fast car And I got a plan to get us out of here I been working at the convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money We wo n't have to drive too far Just ` cross the border and into the city You and I can both get jobs And finally see what it means to be living. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings is an instrument by itself and highly effective on `` Behind the Wall,'' a song about a battered woman. She sings a capella of the harsh realties of the domestic fight: `` Last night I heard the screaming - Then a silence that chilled my soul'' _ and slams the police for doing nothing. She grew up in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and has been singing since she was a child. She was in a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> boarding school when singer-songwriters had been put out to pasture by synthesizer philistines. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> did n't turn on her radio, but many of her classmates listened to folk music and played guitar. In college, one of her classmates was <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppelman </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, is a leader in the music publishing business. This gave her the wedge she needed to gain entry to the recording world. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, whose musical roots can be traced to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was part of a new wave of singer-songwriters in the late 1980s, especially women such as <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shocked </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>, whose feel-good anthem `` Do n't Worry, Be Happy'' brought him three of his five Grammy award nominations Thursday, is a one-man band without the hardware The a cappella tune offering the advice of putting aside nagging worries of daily life _ such as paying the rent _ is a multi-track recording of simple lyrics accompanied by layers of sounds all made by <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>. The vocal gymnast's nominations included best song, record and male pop vocal performance for `` Do n't Worry,'' best album for `` Simple Pleasures,'' and best male jazz vocal performance for the song `` Brothers.'' `` Do n't Worry'' was the first a cappella song to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts. And it brought the widest recognition to a voice heard on jeans commercials, in `` The Bill Cosby Show'' theme and singing the alphabet on `` Sesame Street.'' <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>, 38, left the orchestra out when he recorded `` Simple Pleasures,'' using only his voice and other sounds such as percussion made with his body. His live shows are much the same: no band, but a resourceful entertainer who can turn the audience into part of the show. `` What you're hearing is me thinking aloud,'' <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> said in a biography released by his label, EMI-Manhattan. His intent is to get `` a mature audience to be childlike and spontaneous.'' Nominated six times previously, <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> has already taken home five <PERSON> Grammys </PERSON>, three for best male jazz vocalist. But he finds the title confining. `` To be labeled as a jazz singer is limiting,'' <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> said in his biography. `` I like to think of myself as one who has simply been infused with a lot of music.'' <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is the son of classical singers and began studying music at the age of 6. The family moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1958. <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> formed a quartet in high school, studied music at <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cerritos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, worked as a keyboard player with the Ice Follies, in a series of lounge bands and as a hotel singer and pianist. Jazz vocalist <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> invited him to join his group in 1979, and <PERSON> McFerrin </PERSON> made his debut album in 1982, following up by taking part in all-star jazz tours of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He tried his first solo concert in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, in 1983, toured solo and recorded his second album, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>,'' a live a cappella recording. Numerous TV appearances and collaborations followed.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Thursday said authorities seized new documents that may show West German companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says is a chemical weapons plant. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> gave no details about the documents while answering questions from reporters in a studio appearance late Thursday night on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network. The government previously maintained it had no evidence of a West German link to the plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital. The stunning reversal embarrassed West German authorities. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that Libyan officials contacted West German companies for clean-up help after a dangerous chemical spill in August at the facility. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Imhausen-Chemie was one of those the Libyans called for help, the network reported. A group of West Germans was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week to examine evidence that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says indicates the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> plant is a chemical weapons factory. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the facility is a pharmaceutical plant. `` There are new indications that will be further checked,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said when asked if the government had new evidence of West German involvement in building the plant. `` More documents have been seized and they could give evidence, I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the documents involved chemical equipment that could be used in many ways, but he did not elaborate. He did not say where the papers were seized. He said the federal intelligence service also was involved in investigations. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said authorities were looking for evidence that could stand in court before bringing any charges. A ranking official said on condition of anonymity: `` There is no question that these allegations have caused serious damage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s international prestige. The government is in an extremely embarrassing and difficult position.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> noted his government initially rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that a German company played a major role in the construction of the plant. He said there was no more ill will between the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad that by the political discussions some bad feeling which came up for a few days could be cleared up and that we could have this discussion now in a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation -LRB- and -RRB- mutual responsibility,'' <PERSON> Stoltenber </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has raised the possiblity of military action against the plant. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who told reporters a week earlier there was no proof of West German complicity, said Thursday: `` There are a number of indications that evidently point in this direction.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiki </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, said on CBS News Thursday that West Germans `` did help us, not only in this plant, in other plants also.'' In <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, was arrested and charged with forging shipping documents for goods delivered to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gedopt </PERSON> was arrested on the basis of information provided by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said the information was found by investigators examining seized records of I.B.I. Engineering, a defunct <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> company linked to the <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> plant. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in November the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had evidence of West German involvement in building and outfitting the plant. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials revealed the name of one suspect company, Imhausen-Chemie of <LOCATION> Lahr </LOCATION>, nearly two weeks ago, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to order an investigation. Last week, the government said an audit of the firm's records produced no evidence of illegal exports. On Wednesday, government sources confirmed that a criminal investigation of I.B.I. Engineering's activities was under way and said authorities had seized company documents. A secretary who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie on Thursday said company officials were not available for comment. Company manager <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON> has denied any connection to the Libyan plant. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Koerbler </PERSON>, former business manager of <ORGANIZATION> I.B.I. </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment on the case. The <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network quoted <PERSON> Koerbler </PERSON> earlier as saying `` many German firms'' were involved in the Libyan project. <PERSON> Koerbler </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he had been misquoted, but would not elaborate.

<DATELINE>BLYTHE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A film critic who gets $ 8 a review and wo n't do R-rated movies has been banned from the only theater around because her negative reviews hurt business, theater officials said. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, a free-lancer who writes for the twice-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, was given a refund and asked to leave as she watched a recent screening of `` Gorillas in the Mist'' at the 600-seat <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON>. `` People were staying away from the theater because of her reviews,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the theater owner's brother and an attorney for the <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON>, in Thursday's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 37, co-owner of the theater, called it a matter of economic survival, even though his movies are n't advertised in the paper. But Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, who said most of her reviews are positive, vowed to continue writing reviews _ even if she has to travel 90 miles to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, to see the pictures. `` I'm incensed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> said. `` By driving to <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> I'm telling them they ca n't stop me from writing reviews. Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, 29, gets $ 8 for each review she submits, she said. The standoff has spawned angry editorials in the paper, with a circulation of 4,500, protests outside the theater and talk of a legal challenge. Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON>, who wrote similar reviews for some small newspapers in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, claims the ban was unfounded based on her track record in <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>, a desert town of 8,400 people about 220 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Of the 28 reviews I have written, 17 have been positive,'' she said. `` That's a pretty good percentage,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON>, a movie critic for Newsweek magazine. `` I do n't think any of us would survive in <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>.'' Some of Ms. <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'s reviews have been harsh. The movie `` Hot to Trot, she wrote, `` Has only one thing to recommend it. It will restore your faith in TV. Nothing on the tube is this stupid, unimaginative, tedious and irritating.'' Yet on the fantasy-adventure `` Willow,'' she wrote: `` It offers sympathetic characters, a powerful conflict between good and evil, fantastic action sequences ... and that most elusive of movie attributes: a happy ending.'' Of `` Police Academy V,'' she wrote: `` The comedy is sophomoric but rarely offensive, and you'll even get a few big laughs for your money.'' `` Moonstruck,'' which won Cher an Oscar for Best Actress Oscar, was `` basically a very old-fashioned movie with old-fashioned ideas about love; but if it does n't make a believer out of you, maybe you should have your cynicism level checked.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> considers Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> a dilettante lacking the credentials to review films. In a letter to the editor, published by the newspaper, he wrote: `` Were her distorted, negative and unfair criticism harmless, we could perhaps ignore her, and chuck it off to a small-town mind that dabbles in writing newspaper articles.'' The newspaper has published several editorials denouncing the theater's action, and urged supporters to picket the movie house. About a dozen people recently showed up with picket signs. One read: `` Big Screen, Small Mind.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparlin </PERSON> said that since Ms. <PERSON> Monnett </PERSON> will not review R-rated movies, he is considering using another critic to complement his family film reviewer.

<HEAD>Police Confirm Ritual Suicide Over Hirohito's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police confirmed on Friday that a 38-year-old man committed ritual suicide by disembowelment, or hara-kiri, this week after saying he wanted to follow Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in death. A police official said previous police statements were not true in denying that the suicide was linked to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. `` We must have received different information since then,'' he said. <PERSON> Tadao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, 38, a chef in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, committed suicide in the cemetery at <ORGANIZATION> Junsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and left a letter for his wife saying, `` Since his majesty has departed, I can not live any longer,'' said an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Fukuoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The incident was reported in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Shimbun. It was the third known suicide linked to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death at the age of 87 last Saturday of intestinal cancer. On Saturday and Sunday, two old soldiers hanged themselves in provincial areas, saying in suicide notes they wanted to follow the emperor in death. Following the ancient tradition of the samurai warrior class, <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> placed a white cloth on the ground, knelt, and slit his abdomen with a long kitchen knife, the official reported. He said <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>'s body was found Tuesday by monks at the temple. Ritual suicides, also known here as seppuku, are traditionally viewed as an act of honor and are rare. All the police officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 The leader of last month's military revolt managed to keep his credit current even behind bars, renewing an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card in prison so he could cover his wife's vacation, a newspaper said Thursday Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> is enjoying more privileges than most prison inmates _ and many Argentines in general, other sources said on condition of anonymity. He has his own telephone and a private secretary to coordinate his steady stream of visitors, and he even was allowed to spend Christmas Eve at another prison so he could toast his fellow insurgents, the sources said. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> led a four-day rebellion by more than 800 soldiers that included a siege at a military school outside <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The insurgents surrendered on Dec. 5. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and asked for a renewal on his credit card so he could cover his wife's vacation to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pagina </ORGANIZATION> 12 reported Thursday. A company representative drove to the suburban <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> military base where <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> is being held and waited while the colonel completed the paperwork, the paper reported. Several hours later, approval was granted and Mrs. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> picked up the card, the paper said. Such speedy approvals are reserved `` only for VIP clients,'' it said, noting that prisoners usually have difficulty getting credit, let alone credit cards. Contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that said: `` We believe that the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and those individuals who possess the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card is confidential. `` This policy of privacy is applied in an equal manner with each one of our 30 million members.'' A spokeswoman for the army said: `` That -LRB- <LOCATION> Seineldin </LOCATION> -RRB- report came from journalists. We have no comment on that.'' <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> apparently has n't been confined to a cell since his surrender. Dozens of soldiers, officers, politicians and a few reporters have passed by for visits. The visits are arranged in advance by a private secretary, military sources say, and <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> has a private telephone. On Christmas Eve, <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was flown by helicopter to the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> military prison, 62 miles south of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, to toast the holiday with officers jailed there, the sources said. Critics of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> say the government made a deal with rebels to end the insurrection rather than force their unconditional surrender. Many loyal commanders said afterward they agreed with demands made by rebels for an end to the prosecutions of officers for human rights abuses during the military dictatorships of the 1970s; some sort of public affirmation that the brutal crackdown in which at least 8,900 Argentines were executed was legitimite; and a bigger military budget.

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds gusting to 100 mph destroyed a blimp, shut down an airport, toppled trucks, fanned a brush fire and cut power to thousands of customers in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, officials said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Airships </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> blimp, used by the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to promote a soft drink, was moored at <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when the desert winds struck Wednesday night, reducing it to tatters and leaving little more than its nose cone attached to an anchor pole. Its gondola lay on its side about 30 yards away and the surrounding tarmac was littered with debris. The 14,617-pound airship was the nation's largest, said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>. Its last appearance was at the Jan. 2 Rose Bowl in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. `` It was torn to shreds,'' said <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, public relations secretary at the <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> airport, about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The airport closed all runways because of blowing debris Wednesday evening, but the terminal reopened Thursday with limited operations. Airport manager <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGirolamo </PERSON> said many airlines chose not to take off or land in the high winds. Passengers at the terminal were `` resigned to the fact they are n't going anywhere right away,'' he said. The 10-hour closing halted 45 incoming flights. Power outages disrupted lives throughout the region. `` Weather like this is awful for restaurants,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, owner of the Smokehouse cafe in <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>. `` When there's power outages we lose the coffee maker _ everything,'' she said. `` Everyone is sitting here with each other and the flashlights.'' Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> canceled classes Thursday, saying wind made travel hazardous for school buses. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds _ also called `` devil winds'' _ are spun off by high pressure over the interior of the country, picking up speed as they move from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s deserts through mountain passes and roar down on adjacent communities. At a large truck stop east of the airport, some 2,000 truck drivers and campers waited for the winds to die down, said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. He said at midmorning that at least 700 trucks were parked outside the truck stop's three restaurants. By afternoon the winds ebbed and truckers and campers were on their way, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenyi </PERSON>, another truck stop manager. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the winds were expected to fade Friday. Elsewhere, a downed power line was blamed for a brush fire that charred 200 acres in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said county Fire Department Capt. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Madlock </PERSON>. The fire in <LOCATION> Trabuco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, briefly threatened expensive homes before being surrounded by midnight. <PERSON> Madlock </PERSON> said the high winds aggravated the 220 firefighters' efforts. Residents of about 50 homes were evacuated until flames were doused. Several horses set loose during the height of the blaze had to be corralled, <PERSON> Madlock </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a 50-acre fire fanned by 60 mph winds burned out of control Thursday afternoon near the city of <LOCATION> Ramona </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> reported. Other power lines brought down by high winds caused outages that affected about 6,000 homes and businesses served by <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> counties, said <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The winds also overturned trucks on Interstates 10 and 15, which remained open with traffic moving about 5 mph, said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Blowing dust reduced visibility to almost zero, he said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, winds ripped off part of the roof of the sheriff's station in <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cucamonga </ORGANIZATION> and damaged several private cars, said Deputy <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s Plum, the prototype Sixties `` singles bar'' and pre-Yuppy hot spot that catered to the young and upwardly mobile, put its art deco, art nouveau, funhouse decor on the auction block Thursday. The cafe closed July 10 after 22 years in business. Deal maker <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought a leaded glass window for $ 26,800. The stained glass window, featuring two peacocks against a blue background, was designed from <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Favrile </ORGANIZATION> glass by the restaurant's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeRoy </ORGANIZATION>. Another buyer, an unidentified <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> art dealer, paid the highest price of the day: $ 38,500 for a 12-foot-long, leaded glass window, depicting a cornucopia by artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFarge </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> LaFarge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was the one who supposedly taught <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> how to make the Favrile glass,'' said auctioneer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, who operates an auction house in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> plans to display the window in the <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON>, a hotel he's building in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, who bid on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s behalf after he made a brief appearance at the auction An 18-by-28 foot ceiling, also designed by LeRoy from <LOCATION> Tiffany </LOCATION> glass, was withdrawn from the auction after it failed to make the lowest acceptable bid, which LeRoy put at $ 1 million. Sources at the auction house and the <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> organization indicated the millionaire still was interested in the ceiling and would negotiate for it privately. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s Plum, once a hot spot among trendy New Yorkers in the 1960s, saw its fortunes fail in the highly competitive <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant market of the 1980s. Legend has it that the expression `` singles bar'' was coined there. An estimated 3,000 people stood in line on the night it opened for business with a decor that was an odd concoction of art nouveau, art deco and carnival motifs. Among the items sold Thursday was the funhouse mirror, which went for $ 550, and a carousel horse that brought $ 3,575. Another big attraction, a red <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> motorcycle that <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> bought from <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON> to display at the restaurant, went for $ 16,500. `` They're all my favorites! I'm having so much fun, I may try this with Tavern on the Green,'' said <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON>, an avid collector who also owns that famed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant. The auction brought in a total of $ 766,965. About $ 56,000 of that came from <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who also bought a chandelier and a bronze elephant head, according to <PERSON> Maryalice </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the auctioneer.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday denied published reports that he decided to fire the head of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s famed <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> secret service after a six-year tenure characterized as mediocre and passive. `` The head of the Mossad has not been dismissed,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in a rare public comment on the secret service. `` He is finishing his assignment as planned. It has even been extended. `` All the articles that were printed concerning the head of the Mossad are untrue and baseless. He has done extraordinary work... He enjoys the confidence of the government and my full trust and confidence,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Unprecedented public debate about the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> followed a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision Tuesday overuling the military censor and allowing the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> weekly newspaper Ha'ir to run an article on the Mossad. The article is to run in Friday's editions. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained an advance copy. Ha'ir, quoting foreign newspaper reports, said the Mossad head was responsible for events leading to the expulsion of five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last September. In another incident, <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> left forged passports in a telephone booth, the article said. Author <PERSON> Aluf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> described the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> as a mediocre and manipulative bureaucrat who worked his way up by outlasting more outstanding competitors. The Mossad head, named in foreign reports as <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Adnoni </PERSON>, was appointed in September 1982 as a last-minute fill-in for Gen. <PERSON> Yekutiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, who was the first choice of then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> but was killed in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> wrote. The new chief had been deputy Mossad chief and `` had spent most of his years far from any operations and had not guided any agents,'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> wrote. His main goal as head of Mossad was to hang on to his job by avoiding mistakes, the article said. `` He did n't initiate operations and preferred to leave the ship in port.'' He was so eager to avoid complications that he accepted intrusions into his territory, such as the decision of then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> in 1985-86 to enlist his personal aides rather than the Mossad in selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the article said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> said the search for a new chief began months ago. One of the two main contenders is from outside the agency and the other rose through the ranks, he wrote. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was expected to make his choice within days. Israeli newspapers said he favored the candidate within the agency, noting that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was with the Mossad in the 1950s and 1960s. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Thursday criticized the public debate over the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> chief, saying: `` He and the agency he heads have been caused a great deal of sorrow.''

 Police shot and killed two blacks who were among a group that fired on a military patrol, authorities said Thursday. Police also said a 23-year-old black man was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION>, also in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, where more than 1,000 blacks have died in unrest during the past 18 months. No further details were given. A police report said officers fired birdshot Wednesday at a group of blacks, some of whom were firing at a police patrol, in <LOCATION> Molweni </LOCATION> township near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Two of the men were killed and one injured, the report said. Eleven were arrested. In another development, police said three mines exploded overnight in and around <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION>, a tribal homeland for the Xhosas. The South African government considers the area to be an independent republic, but it is not recognized by other countries. An officer sustained a burst eardrum when bomb experts were trying to detonate one mine in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, police said. Other explosions occurred in <LOCATION> Wilsonia </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and at a railway station on the outskirts of the nearby <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Mdantsane </LOCATION>. Police gave no motives for the explosions and did not comment on whether they were linked. A weekly black newspaper, The New Nation, said there had been at least two cases of clashes between authorities and members of the black communities in the area in the past week. The paper, which the South African government closed down for three months this year, reported that <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION> police and soldiers last week assaulted residents of a village who are opposing their incorporation into the homeland. Many blacks do not want to live in the homelands because their rights to live and work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are curtailed. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A coal dump truck slammed into the side of a school bus filled with students Thursday, injuring more than 40 children and both drivers, authorities said. At least seven people were hospitalized, two in critical condition. `` It was just a tremendous amount of chaos,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sherrif </ORGANIZATION>'s Capt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON>, who arrived at the scene minutes after the accident. `` Several people had stopped on the highway to try to render aid. ... It was a terrible looking scene. ... There were children sitting everywhere. Children were still pinned in the wreckage,'' he said. The bus driver, <PERSON> Enoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 33, was charged with driving with a suspended license, police said, but added that they could not immediately determine who was at fault. The accident occurred at 3:10 p.m. at the entrance of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON> said. Most of the students on the bus were believed to be have attended the school. The truck, headed north, slammed into the bus' midsection, <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON> said, adding that it was not immediately clear what led up to the accident. Rescue units used machines to cut through the crumpled metal to free some victims. `` There was a tremendous amount of screaming and crying,'' said <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON>. `` Some of the students were pinned in together. I saw one instance where one of the students was trying to help the other, even though they both were pinned in.'' `` It happened all of a sudden,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, a 14-year-old who suffered a sprained right arm in the accident. `` It sounded like a stick of dynamite.'' Two 13-year-old boys were in critical condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Colliver </PERSON>. The boys were identified as <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Detherage </PERSON>, hometowns unknown. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> had abdominal injuries and other injuries and underwent surgery late Thursday. Detherage, with head injuries and multiple lacerations, was in the pediatric intensive care unit. At least five others were admitted to <LOCATION> Marymount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, hospital administrator. Thirty-five students, the drivers of the vehicles and an adult school aide were treated and released, the hospital said. Injuries ranged from bruises to massive internal trauma, he said. Authorities had not determined how many students were on the bus, but <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said all were in their teens. The coal truck driver, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, 28, suffered cuts and bruises on his face and <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s 4-year-old son, who was in the truck with him, was under observation, said patrolman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the bus driver, completed state-required training more than a year ago, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The charge filed against him Thursday involved a speeding ticket issued on Aug. 25, <PERSON> Shackelford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> paid the fine but failed to report to traffic school, resulting in the suspension, the patrolman said. About 150 to 175 parents and others converged on <ORGANIZATION> Marymount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after the accident to learn the extent of the students' injuries, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Students who suffered minor injuries, such as glass cuts, were treated in the hospital's hallways while the emergency room and the trauma unit were used to treat the more seriously injured, <PERSON> Hollon </PERSON> said.

 A jury found <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest retailer, liable for $ 2.4 million damages for selling a shotgun to an intoxicated man who later shot and paralyzed another man with it The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> made the award Tuesday to the estate of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON> and his widow, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON> was shot in the back in 1979 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoopsick </PERSON>, who held a longtime grudge against him, and who hours earlier purchased the shotgun and ammunition at a K mart store in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a lawyer for the widow, said the store's sales clerk should have known not to sell the weapon to <PERSON> Hoopsick </PERSON>, who was described as obviously drunk and agitated at the time. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the award was the first in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state where a jury has held a store liable for selling a weapon to a drunken person. Although federal firearms regulations prohibit the sale of guns to minors, illegal aliens, people with drug dependencies and mental deficiencies, there is no prohibition against sales to people who are drunk, he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said there have been a number of successful civil cases against gun retailers in other states, including a recent judgment against K mart in a similar case in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kota </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for K mart based in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said the company would appeal the ruling K mart's lawyers had argued that <PERSON> Hoopsick </PERSON> was not visibly intoxicated and that the sales clerk could n't have known what <PERSON> Hoopsick </PERSON> planned to do with the weapon. K mart has 15 days to file a posttrial motion in the trial-level <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. On Dec. 4, 1979, <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON>, then 59, was shot with a 12-gauge shotgun after returning home from work. One of the pellets from the shotgun blast damaged <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON>'s spinal cord and he was left paralyzed from the waist, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hoopsick </PERSON> was sentenced to five years' probation after pleading guilty to charges in March 1981. <PERSON> Viscomi </PERSON> died of a heart attack on June 28, 1986, according to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The case was originally tried in November 1986 and K mart was found negligent in the selling the shotgun. The jury award the Viscomis $ 500,000. K mart was unsuccessful in getting a state appellate court to overturn the finding the next year. The one-week trial that ended Tuesday was limited to damages only.

 A medical assistant who tried to perform liposuction but wound up killing her best friend instead was sentenced Thursday to 45 days in jail and four years of intensive probation. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> pleaded guilty in November to negligent homicide in the death of <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomazin </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. She admitted giving Miss Tomazin an unintentionally lethal dose of anesthetic while trying to prepare her for the medical procedure, in which fatty cells are sucked from the body. The bungled attempt took place March 27 in the office of Miss <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON>'s former employer, <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> plastic surgeon <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavese </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> also ordered Miss <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> to pay $ 5,500 in restitution to Miss <PERSON> Tomazin </PERSON>'s family and to perform 40 hours per week of community service indefinitely. A clerk for Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said intensive probation amounted to house arrest, requiring written approval in advance of any outside-the-residence activity. Miss <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> will be able to work, the clerk said, but it was not known if she had regained employment since she was fired. Detectives said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomazin </PERSON>, who died March 30, agreed to undergo liposuction at the hands of her friend, who had assisted <PERSON> Pavese </PERSON> in many operations and felt confident she could carry out the procedure.

 The head of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was arraigned Thursday on homicide and arms charges as forces in the governing party began moving to install leaders more sympathetic to President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. A bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local chiefs to evacuate the union's national headquarters before they could vote to confirm the choice of a new secretary-general. Judicial police searched the building. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and 50 other union leaders and associates were arrested Tuesday and Wednesday. Thousands of oil workers demonstrated in protest Thursday night in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Zocalo Plaza A source in the Attorney General's Office said former <ORGANIZATION> Reynosa </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> was suspected of smuggling arms shipments for <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and officials were looking for him. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials met Thursday to try to determine the origin of a weapons cache found in <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s home. The source said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials suspected that drugs may have been used to pay for the weapons. He said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. In a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prison Thursday, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told reporters: `` They told me my family was kidnapped and if I did n't give a statement that pleased the Federal Attorney General, I would n't see them again. He called his detention `` a dirty, prefabricated infamy.'' Still, he urged oil workers to stay on the job. On Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> was named union secretary-general for 30 days. He replaces <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who turned himself in after <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> was arrested and <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s house was searched. <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who has a history of heart trouble, is under arrest in a hospital. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>, `` with more than 30 years of union activity, is a recognized member of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hernandez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galicia </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- group.'' <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> pledged to use `` all legal means to win the freedom of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> and other arrested leaders,'' the newspaper said. Government sources said union rules were not followed in the selection of <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> and indicated it was likely he would not remain in the post. `` The authentic workers, and there are thousands of them, will be able to work better with the company and strengthen'' <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, the state oil monopoly, under a new leadership, a government source said on condition of anonymity. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Arsenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Farell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cubillas </PERSON> objected to the election of <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>, saying that union bylaws require that the union's interior secretary, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Maranto </PERSON>, should replace <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> The government feels <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> would be more sympathetic to President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who has long feuded with the union's powerful innner circle. But union spokesman <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Farell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cubillas </PERSON> `` obviously does not know the union's bylaws.'' <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON> said an extraordinary session of more than 90 percent of local representatives chose <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> for the remainder of <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s five-year term. He said <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> could have been selected under union bylaws but that `` because it was not known how long <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> would be away, they picked <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, like most of the labor movement, is closely tied to the government. But <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, known by his nickname <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Quina </PERSON>, has a longstanding dispute with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. The arrest of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quina </LOCATION>, and 50 others in a violent raid continued to draw criticism Thursday, even from government-linked unions and their leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Wednesday saying it `` strongly protests the violence used'' and called for the freedom of those arrested. Soldiers blew down the door of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s home and a federal agent was killed in the ensuing gunbattle. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest labor federation, and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a government-aligned organization of nearly all the country's unions, met Thursday with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. A statement from the presidency said the meetings were traditional New Year's calls, and did not mention the arrests. Veteran Labor Federation leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> did not speak with reporters after the meeting. In a second statement, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> expressed solidarity with <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> and the labor movement. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>, who held only a minor union office but has been its unofficial boss for years, was charged with homicide, possession of large quantitites of weapons, importing prohibited weapons and resisting authority, said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, an attorney general's office spokesman. Authorities have said more than 200 Uzi submachine guns were found in <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s home when he was arrested Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION>, about 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He told investigators Uzis and about 30,000 cartridges were secretly delivered to him on Dec. 10 and were `` to defend his union members, given the existing situation in the country,'' the attorney general's office said. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said 50 other people arrested face charges of fraud, weapons and tax evasion.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> danced in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> for only one year a decade ago, but it made a lasting impression The superstar of ballet dances tonight on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> in two ballets, `` Apollo'' and `` Who Cares,'' created by <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>, this century's master choreographer `` <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> <PERSON> Dances </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'' is the first offering in the 13th season of `` Dance in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' presented by `` Great Performances'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Asked the most important thing he learned from <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>, the dancer said in a telephone interview, `` I wish I could say he taught me how to choreograph. That would be the best thing. `` I learned from him a lot. He was a very extraordinary man and I had a lot of fun to be with him.'' He says he does n't have a favorite <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> ballet. `` They're all pretty incredible. `` Apollo'' is about the birth of the god, his realization of his divinity and his early education in the power of the arts by the muses of dance, poetry and mime. The muses are danced by <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saland </PERSON> of American Ballet Theater. `` Apollo'' was <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s first of many collaborations with composer <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>. He created `` Apollo'' in 1928, and it is his earliest ballet that is still regularly danced. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> had danced `` Apollo'' under <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s guidance. He did not dance for him in `` Who Cares,'' which <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> created for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> in 1970, after <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> had left the company. For `` Who Cares,'' set to 18 songs by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s choreography is lighthearted, plotless and elegant. It's a style which suits <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, an admirer of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> dance to eight of the songs on TV. Speaking of <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s neoclassic style, in which traditional ballet steps and phrases are used in innovative ways, <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> said, `` What <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> has done for ballet is, he opened to all choreographers future possibilities. He showed what can be done with that kind of music, movement, ideas and aesthetics. `` He pushed the ballet finally to the level of all visual art, music and poetry. Otherwise ballet would have been dragging a century behind everything else.'' On the TV show, <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> calls dancing for <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> the `` experience of a lifetime.'' And he talks about how he felt when <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> praised him. `` After the performance ... I was lucky to get _ I mean sometimes ... a good review from him, and it was just one word, and ... he just opened your dressing room and said, ` Excellent. Good night.' You know? And went home. And stars are shining, you know, for you.'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> first saw `` Apollo'' when he was 11 or 12 in his native <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. It was danced by <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>'s company, from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He first met <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> in 1972, when the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> toured the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In 1974, when he was 26, <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> defected to the West in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, while on a tour of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with a group of dancers from the Bolshoi Ballet. A Kirov Ballet dancer since he was 18, <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> was acclaimed by the Soviet public and critics. He was the youngest star to receive the State Merit of the U.S.S.R. But he felt the need of `` artistic freedom'' _ to dance something beside the princes in such ballet staples as `` Swan Lake'' and `` The Sleeping Beauty.'' Ballerina <PERSON> Natalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarova </PERSON>, a frequent partner at the Kirov before she defected to the West during the 1970 tour, led <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> to American Ballet Theater. He had been with the ABT just long enough to be looking for still further challenges when <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> heard about his restlessness and invited him to join the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> to his apartment, the dancer recalls during the television program. `` He opened the door. He said, ` You do n't mind if I continue doing what I do?' I said, ` Sure.' He was ironing his shirts. And ... we started to talk.'' When <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> was asked to return to American Ballet Theater, as artistic director, he said, `` I discussed with him -LRB- <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> -RRB-. He suggested I would do that. It was friendly, absolutely. I moved back to Ballet Theater with his blessing, you know.'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and the American Ballet Theater ballerinas went to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> where the program, a co-production of <ORGANIZATION> WNET </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Danmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, was filmed. `` They have a good facility there and a good crew. I had a good time,'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> said. `` I hope the audience will enjoy the program. What else can I say?''

 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is a long way from `` Sesame Street,'' but Big Bird and <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> have a pretty good time in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, after learning some lessons about homesickness, international friendship and respect for different cultures. The one-hour special, `` Big Bird in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' airs Monday on PBS. It was filmed on location in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION> and is a co-production of <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worship </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> network in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Arriving in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on an overly organized tour _ they have five minutes to see <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> _ Big Bird and <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> miss the bus after becoming enthralled by all the people with black hair from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. -LRB- They later learn, among other things, that `` o-hi-o'' is Japanese for `` good morning.'' -RRB- The two big Muppets wander the strange city alone, prompting <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> to sing a song about homesickness. But a friendly young Japanese woman -LRB- <PERSON> Maiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawakami </PERSON> -RRB- befriends them. `` What kind of tour would abandon a bird and a dog in a strange country?'' she wonders. `` Probably the same kind of tour that would take a bird and a dog along in the first place,'' Big Bird suggests. She promises to help the two get to <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION> where they can hook up with the tour again and head for home. Along the way, Big Bird uses chopsticks; learns that he should take off his shoes, if he has any, before entering a Japanese home; tries to fit on futon; and learns a few Japanese words _ `` At least on ` Sesame Street' I knew the alphabet,'' he sighs after trying to decipher the Japanese street signs. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> wrote and directed the special. There is a storyline, about the mysterious young woman perhaps being the the Bamboo Princess of Japanese legend. `` Sesame Street'' is seen in Japanese schools where it teaches English to high school and junior high school students. In the special, Big Bird and <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> visit an elementary school. The special has already aired once in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and will be repeated. <ORGANIZATION> CTW </ORGANIZATION> says it was a hit, getting three times <ORGANIZATION> NHK </ORGANIZATION> network's usual rating for educational programs.

<HEAD>Reagan's Economic Accomplishments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 His optimism was out of style with much of the investment community and the economic fraternity throughout his term in office, but in retrospect his view seems justified by the results. The Dow Jones industrial average produced a 16 percent average compound investment return during his two terms, and the bond market's 10 percent real rate of total return was the best for any presidency since <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>'s. As the president said in his farewell address, `` We were n't just marking time; we made a difference.'' A great many of the investment talent in Wall Street and the economic brains of academe and business did n't really believe him, though, and you can find it imprinted on their record year after year during the 1980s. While he exuded hope they issued warnings. It was a regular ritual: When the annual White House economic forecast was issued it was instantly discounted as overly optimistic. Sometimes it was, but maybe it was intentional _ a challenge to work for, rather than an easy mark. Throughout eight years the warnings came from Wall Street about inflation, recession, monetary collapse, niggardly corporate earnings, the weaknesses of the manufacturing sector, the budget deficits. Disaster seemed imminent. Maybe President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was lucky to escape the disasters, and there are grounds for believing that some of the financial disappointments of his administration might adversely affect the economy for years to come. Still, there was a job to be done when he entered office and it could n't wait. The recession of the early 1980s was by some measures the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Moreover, confidence was shot. The great American manufacturing machine was in its own private depression, outmatched both domestically and abroad by newer entrants in the world marketplace. Inflation roared. Interest rates were high. Faith was a feather. It was so bad President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had referred to the American people as suffering from a malaise. Optimism was n't in the picture, but it was put there. Nothing does it like economic progress, or the belief that it will come. Interest rates began a long decline, from a prime above 18 percent in 1981 to under 8 percent by the mid-1980s. Inflation came down from the double digits to under 4 percent. Economic activity surged. Disposable personal income shot from a gain of less than 1 percent in 1982 to 5.9 percent in 1984. Profits ascended from minus 27 percent in 1982 to plus 22 percent in 1983. More than 19 million jobs were created and filled, 3 million of them in 1988 alone. <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> from disuse, the American manufacturing sector was resurrected and became competitive again. Almost stagnant, and sometimes falling during the previous two decades, manufacturing labor productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 3.5 percent from 1986 through the third quarter of 1988. More than 400,000 jobs were created in manufacturing in both 1987 and 1988, and much of the increased production was sent overseas, helping to lower the trade deficit. You might never have guessed some of these achievements if you placed credence in the threats, warnings, caveats, criticisms, advisories and the like that accompanied daily, weekly and monthly analyses from research departments. Maybe it was just a ritualistic rite to distract the demons. Somebody believed; otherwise, the economy could n't have done what it did _ stocks could n't have risen, for instance _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could n't have been re-elected The president believed, and it was contagious.

 <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> used to thrive on four hours of sleep a night, arriving for work at 1:30 a.m. and staying until evening to command the aggressive stock-trading desk of the brokerage that bears his name. Now the 58-year-old ex-broker spends much of his time with defense lawyers and federal investigators, chainsmoking cigarettes, answering questions and wondering when he will get back to his passion on the 33rd floor of a downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> skyscraper, buying and selling big blocks of stock. A criminal courtroom has replaced his sprawling trading desk; the tension of interrogation has replaced the thrill of stock speculation; the priority of avoiding jail time has replaced the obsession with serving clients. Once spectacularly successful, widely admired and courted by almost every big takeover strategist, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> has been transformed over the last two years into what gangsters might call the biggest canary in his business. He is the leading prosecution witness in at least three major fraud cases that arose indirectly from the man who squealed on him, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the stock speculator and inside trader now serving a three-year prison term. In exchange for lenient treatment, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> agreed with federal prosecutors in March 1987 to plead guilty to two violations of securities laws, cooperate in other investigations, resign from his brokerage, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and stay out of the securities business for at least five years. `` Yes, I miss it,'' <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> said, standing outside a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal courtroom on a break in his recent witness-stand debut in the stock-manipulation case against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a top company officer. He declined to elaborate and spent much of the break in a witness waiting room, puffing <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Hedges 100s, chewing gum and slowly pacing the floor. He looked tan and fit in a dark-blue business suit, but his blue eyes were slightly bloodshot and he seldom smiled. `` Here's a guy who used to get up at 1:30 in the morning to go work,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Linn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' lawyer. `` It's not easy for a man who's worked like that to stand around in a federal courthouse.'' Nevertheless, life is n't that bad for <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>. He remains fabulously wealthy and owns expensive homes in <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, which he shares with his wife. He spends much of his time on the telephone to keep abreast of the market, though he generally refrains from calling his colleagues at the company, <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> said. `` I suppose he's allowed to call, but the company does n't like for him to, so he does n't,'' the lawyer said in an interview. A good golfer, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> has started a scholarship program in <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> for aspiring young golf amateurs. Although defense lawyers have tried to claim this generosity is meant to impress the judge who ultimately will sentence him, <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> denied that. `` The fact is, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> had a son killed in an accident. He is passionately involved with young people, having lost his son,'' <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> said. `` He has no ulterior motive in doing his golf deal.'' <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' punishment remains unclear, but is expected to be far less than the maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and $ 500,000 in fines he faces for pleading guilty to one count of violating stock-margin requirements and one count of aiding and abetting to keep false books. He even suggested on the witness stand, in cross-examination by defense attorneys in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial, that he does n't expect to serve any prison time. To a large extent, the severity of the sentence will depend on the fruits of his cooperation, which were bruised this past week when a federal judge decreed a mistrial in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case because the prosecution mishandled a key piece of evidence. Aside from his involvement in <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> is a leading witness in securities fraud prosecutions against <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, a Florida-based takeover speculator, and <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a New York-based securities professional. Both are former Jefferies' clients <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> and other associates of <LOCATION> Jefferies </LOCATION> have tried to portray him as a man so driven to serve his customers that he crossed the bounds of legality on their behalf, not out of personal avarice. Many big investors have expressed faith in him, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> takeover strategist <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' lawyer conceded that other clients might feel betrayed by a trusted broker who later turned state's evidence in a major criminal investigation. `` Yes, I suppose there would be some of those people,'' <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> still has a very loyal and large following. He did a lot of things for a lot of people.'' <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' rapid rise, generosity and crashing downfall are part of the folklore of the 1980s takeover boom. A <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> graduate and former ranch hand, he started in the securities business by landing an entry-level job at a small brokerage, quit six years later and founded his own firm with two employees. By early this decade, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had swelled to more than 400 employees, with a large trading center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, five other offices nationwide and one in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It became known as the leading firm where investors could trade big blocks of stock quickly and discreetly, without going through conventional stock exchanges. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> was said to delight in making markets for high-profile stocks, and the positions he took in well-known targets sometimes determined the outcome of takeover battles. In late 1986, for example, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> helped Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquire <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by selling the Canadian developer a large block of its Allied holdings for more than $ 1.7 billion. Part of the attraction for takeover investors was Jefferies' policy of absolute confidentiality and extraordinary accommodation in doing business at their convenience, no matter when <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> once said he could call the company as early as 3 a.m. and <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> would answer the telephone, having arrived early to trade European stocks. `` There were no such things as hours for <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` You could find <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> seven days a week, 24 hours a day.'' Despite predictions that his brokerage would falter following his plea agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> continues to be an aggressive trader and he intends to return there when his legal ordeal finally ends, <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> said. `` He's lost without that business. That business literally was his life,'' the lawyer said.

<TEXT>
 Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and clear mountain views, fast-growing <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has become a metropolis with the usual smog and traffic jams. Some people are starting to protest. A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to limit the height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is gearing up before a vote this spring. The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in the past decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently imposed six-month moratorium on downtown growth. The 55-story <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> was completed last year, bumping the 50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No. 1 is the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s tallest building, the 76-story black-glass <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> built in 1985, before downtown zoning went into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 stories or more, and all but three were opened in the 1980s. The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and shoppers, make downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> a lively place. Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants compete shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place Market. Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the downtown retail core, with major flagship department stores and a variety of small businesses, recently settled one 30-year-old land-use debate with the opening of <ORGANIZATION> Westlake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a new mall of expensive shops and a 24-story office tower. Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown Development, or CAP, say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more pollution as more people commute by car and more box-like apartment buildings replace single-family houses and dilute the flavor of old city neighborhoods. CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the office district. New office floor space would be limited to 500,000 square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet a year from 1995 through 1999. After that, the ceiling would be lifted unless re-imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office space is newly completed, under construction or has received city permits, said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member and CAP supporter. At the present rate of growth, in 10 years some 67,000 new office workers are expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000 more car trips daily into downtown, she said. There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A building's size is worked out according to a formula based on the size of the site, with extra height allowed in exchange for such amenities as plazas, retail space and day care centers. CAP supporters insist they want growth, but not at a high cost to the environment and the neighborhoods. `` We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON>, a jeweler and president of <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, which supports CAP. `` We're really much more into shaping growth so that it produces and accentuates the livability of the city.'' Some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs controls that are more lenient than the CAP initiative. Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> presented a plan of his own that would limit office towers to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code, but not as much as CAP would. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow developers to build higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the bonuses from street-level amenities to housing, human services and open space. The <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of developers and business executives, contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, president of the association, says downtown growth makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and suburbs. A downtown provides a focal point for a rapid-transit system, something <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> needs, he said. And <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> must grow, he contended. `` We're having childen like every other part of the country and there's got to be jobs.'' <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyberg </PERSON>, a professor of urban planning and architecture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, agreed <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s location on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> means it will grow, but disagreed that concentrated downtown growth is good. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has an `` hour-glass'' figure, squeezed between Puget Sound and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said. `` So there are some very limited physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen, and this was not done.'' A better way to grow, <PERSON> Nyberg </PERSON> said, would be in decentralized clusters throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would live near their jobs and go to downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> mainly for conventions and cultural events. Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality, traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of afforable housing, he said. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which `` has been a very livable city,'' he said, failed to learn from other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied, `` It's all greed. The growth-control initiative goes before voters May 16, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided last week. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that the city's 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate and that any changes should be made through more hearings and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> votes. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>' local chapter agrees. CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely. According to <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> needed to enact stiffer downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long, until the cost of housing went way up and the character of the city changed. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> voters approved the limits after a building spree in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between 1979 and 1984. The high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s financial district. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s voter-approved plan limits new office space to 475,000 square feet for several years for a city with a population of 690,000. That compares with CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city of 490,000. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> suggests people who signed CAP did not really want to limit growth, but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state convention center. The initiative text was long and complicated, and people probably did not read it, he said. What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it needed. <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON> thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a highly financed campaign against it.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hint of revolution is in the air in at least some big-city school systems: an apparent readiness, at long last, to stop bickering and start reforming. The nation's largest system, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, continues to generate shocking headlines about violence, drugs and widespread neighborhood school board corruption. Within the last month, an elementary school principal and three teachers were picked up on drug charges. And last week, a kindergartner was found with a .25 - caliber But the picture has begun to brighten elsewhere. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, teacher unions and school administrators have beaten their swords into reform-minded contracts that boost teacher pay and power while making them directly accountable for their students' performance. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where the dropout rate is at least 40 percent, fed up voters elected a reform school board slate in November. They also refused to approve new school taxes and bonds aimed at paying off an estimated $ 158 million deficit. There are even hopeful signs in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s schools, branded 14 months ago as the nation's worst by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> signed legislation last month scrapping <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s central school board next July, to be replaced by parent-run councils empowered to set budgets and hire and fire principals. That hardly means such cities have solved their school problems, officials are quick to admit. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s new governing structure may lead to unprecedented parent power, but the basic problems still fester: a 45 percent dropout rate and below-average standardized test scores. As <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> teacher union leader <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanski </PERSON> put it: `` We have set the table; we have not served the meal yet.'' Hopeful signs are scarce in the 960,000-student <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> system. It's true that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s state legislature recently passed long-sought bills clearing the way for desperately needed school construction and making new rules to curb school board patronage. But Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, whose much-heralded arrival as an outsider from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> last March raised hopes for new approaches, has instead found himself tangled in investigations of local school board corruption. To some, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> remains a system adrift. `` At this point, there are a lot of people putting out ideas, and a lot of people wringing their hands. We have to have the administration put out a specific plan so that people can get behind it,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Willner </PERSON>, deputy executive director of Interface, a watchdog group that issues frequent reports on city school issues. All of which raises the question: What does it take to put the nation's largest school systems on the road to reform? Relative size and the power of the purse are certainly key factors, says <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Husk </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, for example, has only 40,000 students, and its school board has taxing authority. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has 25 times more students, and its school board has no authority to tax. Its size and tangled politics foster a feeling of hopelessness. Some now openly wonder how many drug-addicted principals and teachers it will take to finally jolt the system. `` I think that you need a catalyst. I hate to say it has to be horrible. Unfortunately in a school system this size, it may have to be,'' said <PERSON> Willner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' 80,000-student public schools have an additional disadvantage: they must compete with a popular, 35,000-student parochial school system that siphons off political support. But all cities have obstacles to overcome. Whether they succeed in reform, or even attempt it, usually depends on someone in authority willing to lead the charge. `` You need leadership at the top. Those at the top and those in the private sector have to see it as an absolute emergency. It's a political problem,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, a national spokesman for reform and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching, which has produced several reports on urban school problems. In <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, new superintendents have made a difference. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McWalters </PERSON>, named in 1986, signaled willingness to form a working partnership with teachers. Under a contract that took effect this year, each teacher is directly responsible for 20 students, holding daily meetings and home visits where necessary. In return, top teacher salaries will rise to $ 70,000 and school-based planning teams consisting of teachers, parents, students and principals will set goals for each school. `` When <PERSON> McWalters </PERSON> came in, he shared my sense of urgency, and he was devoid of the baggage and inhibitions that management often has,'' said <PERSON> Urbanski </PERSON>. `` His passion proved infectious. After our collective bargaining agreement, we had left little choice for the political and business structure but to follow suit to help us make it work.'' <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s superintendent, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, who arrived in 1980 as an outsider to a city enmeshed in a bitter dispute over school desegregation, helped move the school system beyond that dispute and establish it as a national model of reform. He promptly began biweekly meetings with the teacher union, established a center to enhance teacher skills, and attracted millions in corporate funds to support innovative programs. Likewise in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the teacher union and superintendent have stopped fighting and started cooperating to devise a reform plan. But the key factor was leadership, said Husk. `` The thing to remember is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had an education governor, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, and he made a substantial investment in schools long before other states were even thinking about reform.'' Some feel <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is still waiting for such leadership. `` We do n't have any one elective official who has made education their primary issue,'' said <PERSON> Willner </PERSON>. `` In terms of using the bully pulpit, having an education mayor or governor, that has n't happened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the bad times keep rolling for a school system perennially starved of leadership and tax dollars. Still, many are encouraged by the election last year of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s reform-minded governor, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, a property tax increase last April, and a new, expanded school board That may not be enough. A state report showed that 370 of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' 4,800-teacher staff were either uncertified or had temporary certificates, and despite recent increases, salaries still average just $ 26,800, about $ 2,000 below the national average. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> public schools remain a factory for the expansion of the underclass,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, a private education consultant. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> sees four elements necessary to move big systems toward reform: clearly stated goals, smaller schools structured so that students no longer feel anonymous, more school-based authority where officials are regularly accountable for results, and above all, partnerships between parents, civic, corporate and educational officials. `` If you pull these reform efforts apart, these cities are making progress on governance, and partnerships,'' said <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. `` What I do n't see is much attention to school climate, student alienation, and the question of educational goals and outcomes.''

With exhilaration tempered by `` this deficit looming over everything,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office at noon Friday, convinced there is neither a need nor a mandate for dramatic change to put his imprint on the White House. `` Automatically, that happens,'' he said, with the transfer of power from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 40th presidency to his 41st. As keynotes to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> era, the last eight years are likely to weigh far more heavily than the first hundred days. `` I've been a part of this administration and it is n't like there is a need for radical change,'' the president-elect said in an interview in his vice presidential office, across a narrow, private street from the White House. His transition teams have gone throughout the government to prepare for the new administration, but `` it's different,'' not like those he met as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director in 1976 when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s advance guard arrived `` saying we're going to find out what's wrong here and change it.'' Different, too, from `` the teams we sent sallying forth in 1980 to go out and undo all the bad things that we had campaigned against.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes his administration needs to `` correct one big problem,'' the federal deficit, then `` build on some tremendous successes'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` That's at least the approach that I'm going to bring to the job,'' he said, sipping a cup of Chinese tea. `` ... People understood that when they were voting. They were n't looking for a radical shift.'' That last thought was a refrain throughout the conversation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he envisions no single theme for his first hundred days, no centerpiece drive like the one that won approval of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax cut economic plan in 1981. The initial months usually are the strongest season in a first term, and the most promising for congressional acceptance of proposals from a new administration. That goes double for a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president seeking action in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The new president will set out his agenda in his inaugural address on Friday and in an address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early next month. He said the message will not be one of major overhaul, `` for very obvious reasons. I've been a part of what we have been doing, what this president, the present president has accomplished ...'' The tie to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was on his mind as he performed one of his last vice presidential duties, presiding over the `` kind of antiquated drill'' in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> counted the electoral votes that made him president. `` I was thinking ... well, this is historically interesting because this is a continuation, hopefully building. There's going to be change, but hopefully a building on what's happened.'' Inevitably, then, comes the question of how this new president can put his imprint on an administration he heralds as a continuation of what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began. `` Style, message, people, be yourself,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` ... I made my mind up as vice president to do my job one way. But I'm not vice president, I'm president. I'm the one who's calling the shots. I'm the one who's going to set the agenda ... `` So automatically, that happens That happens at the time when I put my hand on that Bible and hold my right hand in the air and say that oath. It happens.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the successs and problems of presidential leadership will continue to be identified with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a short time, but `` in a while, six months from now, that will be identified with me.'' For all the problems that will be on his new desk on Saturday morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is excited about the task and eager to confront the agenda. `` If it were n't for this deficit looming over everything else, leave all the rest of the problems in there, I'd feel like a spring colt,'' he said.

 When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s comedy routine on the `` seven dirty words'' was broadcast by a radio station in 1978, it prompted a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on indecency. A decade later, a character on the hit network sitcom `` Designing Women'' used a derivative of one of those words in describing another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom. No, it is n't just imagination. Network standards are loosening up. `` The networks are being more lenient, and I think the reason is a five-letter word _ C-A-B-L-E,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, executive producer of `` Designing Women.'' Sexually explicit language and situations on network television have produced occasional complaints, but audiences are apparently rather blase after being presented a variety of R-rated cable fare, not to mention videocassettes. <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 62.2 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes with televisions also have a VCR. The networks, faced with remote-control `` grazing,'' cable options and videocassettes, are having to loosen up or lose viewers. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 1 network, broadcast `` Favorite Son,'' a political potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage. In an episode of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething,'' a wife crawled around on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm. Last season, `` Saturday Night Live'' executive producer <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> complained about his battle with network censors over a sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word for the male sex organ on network TV. This season, the sketch got on the air. `` The average family in a major urban center can have access to 30-plus different television signals, not to mention home video, -LRB- where -RRB- they can see explicit language, full nudity and simulated sex in far more graphic and strong ways than you've ever seen on network television,'' says <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for program marketing and administration. He says networks are loosening standards, but carefully keeping back from the `` cutting edge'' of change. `` We're not changing first,'' <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> said. Do viewers mind? `` I get a lot of discussion on it, but really when you sit down and look at it and hear what's said, I do n't really hear anybody complaining,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is,'' he said, `` whether you like it or not, it does produce ratings, which means that people are watching it.'' `` There are three groups of viewers out there,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, head of Virginia-based Viewers for Quality Television. `` There's your group that would really like to see more -LRB- explicit material -RRB-. They enjoy that. It's interesting, and it's entertaining, and it's fun. ... `` Then there's another group that are your prudes who really feel that there should n't be a single dirty word, no open-mouthed kissing, no bedroom scenes. Those people are going to always object, and they must be just screaming right about now. `` And then there's the group that just accepts it and keeps their eye on it and turns the dial if they do n't like it.'' When the radio station broadcast <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s `` seven dirty words'' routine _ <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> was explaining that there are seven words not allowed to be broadcast _ a complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> prompted a lawsuit that led to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The FCC does not get involved in network standards, but investigates complaints against the stations that it licenses. A complaint about a network show would have to meet the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of indecency before action would be taken Indecency is described as `` patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium.'' For network censors, `` community standards'' apply to a global village, where a `` community'' can be a time period or a demographic group. The changing expectations of television audiences have changed the stereotypical scissor-wielding censor into something of ad hoc sociologist. `` TV is a dynamic medium. It has to stay in touch with society. It has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are relevant to people's lives,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Margo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for program practices. `` I think the objective here is not to go too far. It's to be willing to grow, to be willing to take prudent risks, but never to do anything that's going to offend a significant portion of our viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates.'' All three networks have cut back their standards and practices departments to save money, but insist nothing has gotten on the air that would not have before. The cutbacks have, however, `` increased the possibility of risk,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for broadcast standards and practices, `` because you do n't have an overview and backup system that existed.'' CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger workload on supervisors. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> eliminated its standards and practices department completely, re-assigning most of its functions to the entertainment division, which may be akin to the fox guarding the henhouse. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was no doubt chastened by its experience with <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s two-hour special `` Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground. Though the sensationalistic special ranked No. 5 in the Nielsen ratings for the week, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it lost money because so many advertisers pulled out. <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> says the show was actually `` a triumph'' for the remnants of the standards department, in view of how much gruesome material was eliminated. During a recent presentation to television critics meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> was accosted by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of Bibles that he would not air another <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> special. `` Devil Worship'' was attacked by television critics in part because of its early time period, 8 p.m. EST, when presumably children could be watching. In fact, much of the shift in standards has taken place after 9 p.m. when networks assume mostly adults are watching. An episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 10 o'clock program `` L.A. Law'' opened in the setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door. It turned out he was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar. In an episode of the 9 p.m. `` Cheers'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the bartender was stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement. `` The standards really relate to the kind of program you're dealing in,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> `` What may work in a 10 o'clock program, like ` thirtysomething,' ... would be totally inappropriate to an 8 o'clock program.'' One way standards departments have cut their workload is by paying less attention to such G-rated shows as `` Murder, She Wrote.'' But even `` Designing Women,'' which often tackles sexual subjects, has found the going easier of late, said <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloodworth-Thomason </PERSON> writes most of the scripts. <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said the show has had a good relationship with the censors, but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable breast word was approved. The censor, after seeing the script, wanted to `` reserve judgment.'' `` A lot of times, if we disagree with them, we'll say, ` Look, why do n't you let us shoot it and we'll shoot an alternative, and see how it's used and how it looks in the context of the show,''' <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON> said. `` Fortunately, I do n't remember a time when we've done that they did n't come back later and say, ` OK, we see what you were going for, and it's OK.'

 Six weeks after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> announced it would reduce production, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude prices have risen by more than $ 3 a barrel. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, continued to climb, picking up 45 cents to close at $ 18.14 a barrel. Other contract months also rose. Analysts said a number of factors contributed to the day's gains, including a sharp drop in crude oil supplies and signs that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is holding to its agreement to cut back production. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last November to reduce output by 3 million barrels to 18.5 million barrels a day. WTI prices have since climbed from the $ 15 range and analysts expect strong demand to push prices even higher.

 World crude prices have climbed by more than $ 3 a barrel in the six weeks since <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to cut its production, but analysts remain skeptical that the accord will last. Prices of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil are still below <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s targeted price of $ 18 a barrel, and some of the recent gains may still be lost if the excess oil produced by the cartel late last year reaches the market. Since Nov. 28, when the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> announced it would curtail production, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> crude oil has risen more than $ 3 a barrel _ from approximately $ 11 to about $ 15. West Texas Intermediate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark grade of crude oil, has shot up to more than $ 18 a barrel from $ 15.03 the day the accord was finalized. Most market observers had expected prices to rise but they had forecast a more gradual increase with the excess oil keeping prices soft for some time. Despite the recent increases, experts remain doubtful about the future. `` I do n't see $ 18 in the year for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> basket prices, at least not for any sustained period. There is an overproduction that we will still see the consequences of down the road, `` said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. At the time of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement in November, the 13-member cartel was producing approximately 22.5 million barrels of oil a day. In December, that figure rose to about 23 million. For January, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production will be about 19 million barrels, slightly above its new quota of 18.5 million. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s accord took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months. Since it takes four to five weeks for most <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil to reach markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, analysts believed shiploads of crude pumped late last year would be arriving on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shores any day now, driving prices lower. But they have n't, and the question many are asking is: Where is it? `` I suppose some production could be in transit, but we were hearing about surplus production as early as October and it has n't shown up in the statistics,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pye </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It calls into question the accuracy of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> figures we read about ... Either that or it's being consumed more rapidly than anyone thinks.'' <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, believes a lot of the excess oil is sitting in storage tanks somewhere in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` There was an intentional decision by the cartel to keep as much of that crude as possible off the market so as not to flood the market and force prices lower,'' <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> said. Demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil in major oil-consuming countries like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been stronger than projected. A report Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> showed industrialized countries consumed 38.4 million barrels a day of oil in the fourth quarter, 1 million barrels or 4 percent more than previously forecast. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption was up 4.5 percent while Japanese consumption rose 6 percent. Nevertheless, many analysts believe high demand wo n't be enough to boost or sustain prices for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil at the $ 18 level for the length of the agreement. One <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> country, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, has already acknowledged it is producing above its quota. `` The question still is ` Will <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> stick to its quota beyond the first quarter?''' said <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>.

The merger, which involves a stock swap valued at about $ 635 million and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s assumption of about $ 600 million in <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION> debt, was concluded Wednesday, the two entertainment concerns said. The companies had agreed to a merger last May, but the completion of the deal was delayed because of legal complications arising from <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership of several television stations. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> subsequently disposed of its television stations, completing the sale of the last of them, WPGH in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 37.50. Under terms of the merger agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and each share of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock has been converted into the right to receive .3675 of a share on <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock. With about 46 million shares of common stock outstanding, the <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock could be converted into about 17 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock, worth about $ 635 million at current prices. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would assume <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s debt of about $ 600 million, boosting the value of the transaction to about $ 1.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also reaffirmed its plans to elect <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, as vice chairman and a member of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s board. The election will probably come at the next <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board meeting in February. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is a leading producer and distributor of television programming. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogliatti </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> currently supplies nine shows and seven hours a week of programming carried on the major television networks, including `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Knots Landing'' and <PERSON> Alf </PERSON>.'' She said it supplies an additional 13 shows and 25 hours a week of first-run syndicated programming to local stations, including `` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Love Connection'' and `` Freddy's Nightmares.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> currently has six shows on network television, including `` Night Court'' and `` Growing Pains,'' and spokesman <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the combined total of 15 network shows outdistances production by any other studio. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> already was the leader in entertainment programming, which he defined as movies, television shows and recorded music and publishing. He said the merger will boost its revenue from such programming by $ 600 million a year to $ 4 billion, or about $ 1 billion more than the second biggest entertainment programmer, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> has lost more than $ 380 million in the last 2 -LCB- years, but <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> executives have said they expect <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>'s performance will improve as some of its more popular first-run shows are sold in syndication <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is a leading producer and distributor of movies, television shows and recorded music and has interests in cable operations. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 322 million, or $ 2.02 a share, on revenue of $ 3.01 billion. The stumbling block that had held up completion of the merger stemmed from a 1984 agreement that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and its biggest stockholder, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reached when they bought stakes in one another. As Chris-Craft bought its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> bought a 42.5 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting unit. Chris-Craft sued to block the <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> deal last summer, saying the 1984 agreement prohibited <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from owning television stations as long as it owned 25 percent or more of <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. A state court judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> blocked the planned merger in late September. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> subsequently agreed to sell its television stations, completing the sale of its interest in two stations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in late December and the sale of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> station late Tuesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s exit from the manufacturing arena is a boon to the firm's shareholders, who will receive stock in three new companies free of charge while retaining their shares in the streamlined company. Household International said Wednesday it was dissolving its $ 1 billion manufacturing group, ending four years of restructuring efforts, and would concentrate solely on financial services. The company said it would spin off three manufacturing units to shareholders and sell six other businesses, including <ORGANIZATION> Thermos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a pleasant surprise to see a company doing something right,'' said <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> called Household's announcement `` an illustration of their integrity. `` They realize they can increase shareholder value by spinning off these operations,'' he said. Analysts said the value of Household's stock may decline slightly, but the value of shareholders' new stock should more than make up the difference. The three independent companies to be created are <ORGANIZATION> Eljer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a building products company with anticipated 1988 sales of more than $ 400 million; <ORGANIZATION> Schwitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of engine parts with anticipated 1988 sales of $ 140 million; and <ORGANIZATION> Scotsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of commercial refrigeration products with anticipated 1988 sales of $ 175 million. The firm will be left with four financial-services operations: <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Household's stock price surged $ 5.25 Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the announcement, closing at $ 62.37 -LCB- <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> estimated the combined potential value of the surviving company and the three spinoffs at $ 72 a share _ $ 58 for Household's financial-services operations and $ 14 for the spinoffs Household said it was considering a tax-free distribution of one new share in each of the three spinoffs for every five shares of Household's common stock on or about April 15. Household said it would use the proceeds from the transactions to reduce its $ 500 million debt by about $ 255 million and pump about $ 95 million into its financial services businesses. `` The actions represent a logical next step to several years of restructuring in a continuing effort to maximize shareholder value,'' Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in a statement. The units to be sold are: Thermos, the well-known maker of insulated products for storing and serving food; GC-Thorsen, a marketer of entertainment accessories and hand tools; <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a leading manufacturer of heavy duty casters; King-Sealey, a major supplier of cooking-appliance controls; <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a furniture maker; and <ORGANIZATION> WaterTest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a provider of water-testing services for consumer and commercial markets. Household, which is based in Prospect Heights northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said it expected to receive `` well in excess'' of $ 120 million for the six units. Analysts said Household's departure from manufacturing was not surprising, considering the company's sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandising </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in 1985 and of National Car Rental a year later. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wightman </PERSON>, vice president of research with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said investors perceived manufacturing as having a `` cyclical influence'' on Household's stock price. He said the company may be able to attract more investors by focusing on financial services, which are considered to be more stable. Household said it expected 1988 sales from its manufacturing division to exceed $ 1 billion. The company reported overall 1987 profit of $ 221.5 million on sales of $ 3.4 billion. Household said it could not provide an overall figure for 1988 sales and profits, but that it expected a 20 percent increase in per-share earnings for the year.

<HEAD>Mexico's Government Petroleum Monopoly At A Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Mexico-Union ^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a look at <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s government petroleum monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexicanos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, better known as <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, and the Oil Workers Union:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE COMPANY: <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, accounts for nearly half the government's revenues and is intimately identified with the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It was created in 1938 after President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> nationalized foreign oil firms on March 18 of that year. It is not a member of the oil cartel <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> but tends to follow the pricing policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 ASSETS: By law, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> has a complete monopoly over the exploration and production of all hydrocarbons in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, as well as refining and the production of 36 `` basic'' petrochemicals. It controls every aspect of the petroleum industry except for service stations, which are private. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> claims assets of $ 31 billion, including nine refineries and a score of petrochemical plants, as well as oil tankers, offshore drilling rigs, one of the tallest buildings in the country and over 32,000 miles of pipelines.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PRODUCTION: <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> is the world's sixth-largest producer of oil and the fifth-largest producer of petrochemicals. Crude oil production is about 2.8 million barrels per day. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is exporting about 1.36 million barrels a day, or about 40 percent of its oil, to 50 nations around the world. About half of the exports go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> supplies 90 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s energy needs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE UNION: The <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> controls more than half the lucrative drilling contracts let by <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> and 95 percent of its jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> has about 180,000 employees and is considered overstaffed by industry experts. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> workers are some of the highest paid in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and enjoy some of the best fringe benefits. Jobs can be inherited and are sometimes sold under the table.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will have a tougher shield against hostile takeovers under a new employee stock ownership plan that goes into effect this summer, analysts say. `` They see what's happening around them. They'd rather be safe than sorry,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>, said, referring to a recent spate of large takeovers. `` It's no more than a sign of the times.'' While the stock plan will provide new insulation against possible takeovers by giving employees a larger stake in the company, <ORGANIZATION> Proctor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had other intentions. The company said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> is intended to enhance the value of its stock and provide greater retirement security to employees by improving profit sharing plans. A trust created for the new plan will borrow up to $ 1 billion for a period of 15 years, with <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble guaranteeing the loan. The loan's proceeds will be used to buy a new issue of convertible preferred stock from the company, officials said. Pricing, terms and conditions on the preferred stock are to be announced later, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> goes into effect July 1, the company said. The company said its board of directors authorized <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble to use proceeds from issuance of the convertible preferred stock to repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock. This adds 2 million shares to the company's previously announced 10 million-share repurchase program adopted in October 1987. About 1 million shares have been repurchased to date, the company said.

<HEAD>U.S. Airlines Have Three Days To Check 737s Following British Crash</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines have three days to check for cross-wiring in 300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, following speculation that faulty warnings deceived the pilot of a British 737 into shutting down his only good engine when the other one caught fire. `` We think this is not a very likely scenario, but it's a check that can be done very, very quickly without disrupting service,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order late Wednesday applies to eight <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s with U.S.-French CFM56 engines similar to the British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 that crashed Sunday in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, killing 44 people. It also would cover 292 smaller <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s operated by 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. No planes were grounded by the order, and other 737s and other planes using the CFM56 engines would not be affected. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> issued the order after the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> ordered similar checks for three types of aircraft flown by British carriers, including the same two models of the 737 and the Airbus A320. The British agency also ordered increased inspections of CFM56 engines on the planes, a step the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> was still considering, said a spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` air worthiness directive'' gives airlines 72 hours from official receipt of the warnings this morning to make the inspections, which officials said would take about an hour for each plane. This could allow each plane to make one or two flights before the inspection was mandatory, and officials said it should not disrupt airline schedules. `` We certainly believe it's a prudent measure to go out and check to make sure there's nothing wrong with the fleet,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` But certainly this precautionary measure does not imply there has been any cause identified'' for the crash. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he was not aware of any previous incorrect wiring problems in 737s. He said there was one instance of improper instruments connections on a 747 jumbo jet, but the airline discovered the problem and repaired it without any mishap. As a precaution, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also is checking its procedures for testing 737 wiring, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, `` just to verify they're doing what we expect them to be doing.'' British officials said Wednesday it was too early to conclude what caused the crash and they were still examining the possibility that both engines failed. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that the airliner's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> had told ground control the fire was in the right engine. This led to the speculation that crossed wires might have caused warning lights to mislead <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> into shutting down the right instead of the left engine. He could not see the engines from the cockpit. Hunt, who was injured in the crash, was interviewed by investigators Wednesday, but they did not disclose what he told them. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said airlines flying the 737-300s are <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Piedmont is the only airlines using 737-400s with the CFM56 engines. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspections will cover fire warning systems and vibration monitoring circuitry in the aircraft, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. He said there have been `` very, very isolated incidents'' of cross-wiring of warning systems in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft but none has led to an accident. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not recall a specific incident of cross-wiring, but added, `` It is not unheard of for brand new aircraft to come off the assembly line with wires crossed or systems improperly configured.''

 The stock market was little changed today, pausing to test the winds at its highest levels since the 1987 crash.

<TEXT>
 The troubled small-appliance maker <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it asked the federal bankruptcy court to void a previously announced buyout plan by former ally <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. The company, which has been operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection for nearly a year, advised the court that instead it will submit its own reorganization plan. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors voted to take such action late Wednesday, citing the securities firm's deal with other investors to carve up the consumer products company. The board's move, though, angered many of its creditors, who had backed the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> plan. `` We're amazed and disappointed that the board, having postponed a decision from November to December and then from December to January has now rejected the sale route altogether,'' said <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, adviser to a committee of unsecured creditors. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a partner in the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> merchant banking group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which would have participated in the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> takeover plan, also expressed disappointment. `` We were surprised, we're disappointed and we're examining our options,'' he said. In a privately negotiated deal, the total value of which has not been disclosed, the Levy group would have bought <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable lawn furniture and gas grill business for about $ 250 million, according to published reports. The two groups were once competing bidders. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that besides being taken back by the new alignment, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> directors were upset by a decision by <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> to put $ 30 million less common equity into the deal than it had earlier proposed. The board had announced a tentative merger agreement with <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lufkin </PERSON> at the end of last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigators are reviewing admissions by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> that test records may have been falsified at a factory that made parts for military and commercial aircraft, according to court documents and federal officials. The investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the F404 engine that powers the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s FA-18 fighter, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday. The GE factory in question also makes an engine part used by the type of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft that crashed Sunday in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, killing 44 people, but federal and company officials said the part could not have caused the accident. The federal investigation began last year and has no connection with the accident in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday that the factory made a timer valve for the CFM56 engine used by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 as well as a check and drain valve for the F404 engine aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s FA-18 fighter. Another GE employee, attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, said in a letter last year that test records may have been falsified for valves used on the FA-18 in 1984-87. According to newly revealed court papers in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has become involved in the investigation. British investigators looking into the crash of the 737-400 said the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut down. The CFM56 engine for the 737-400 is made jointly by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a French company, <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>. The timer valve manufactured by GE for the CFM56 engine on the 737 could not have caused the turbine to fail or threatened flight safety even if the valve malfunctioned, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft engine operations are based. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said Tuesday the timer assembly could not have caused the British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> crash. He said its failure would only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not a fire. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Nettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was unable to say immediately whether the aircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and drain valves. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the GE attorney, said in a letter dated June 2, 1988, that: `` In late May 1988, it was discovered that prior to July 1987, a particular flow leak check, which is required by <ORGANIZATION> GEAE </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- specifications, was not performed on the F404 check and drain valves.'' `` It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983, possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the letter, obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem was detected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said. `` During the period involved, it is also believed that operators may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to reflect actual test readings,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in the letter. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s letter does not indicate the total number of engines or their value, but said that the deliveries covered the periods of April-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had received <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s letter as part of what they called a `` voluntary disclosure program'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms of their contracts The inspector general's office in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, is investigating the admissions in the letter, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmer </PERSON>, an attorney representing the former manager of the GE plant, said his client had been questioned in connection with the investigation last Oct. 14 by two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Helmer </PERSON>'s client, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Divencenzo </PERSON>, filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> last year on behalf of the government, seeking to recover damages for more than 2,000 F404 engines that <PERSON> Helmer </PERSON> said were delivered without inspection. At the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, all documents in the Divencenzo suit remained under seal until last Friday, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> denied a federal motion to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> until Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the case as a plaintiff. The motion cited the `` factual complexities of the case.''

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Slide In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in quiet activity ahead of Friday's crop report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The report will contain final 1988 crop production totals, with slight increases over the government's previous estimates expected for both corn and soybeans. The report, which is due out after the close of trading on Friday, also will contain new estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles, an actual tally of 1988-89 winter wheat seedings and estimates for 1989 corn and soybean acreage. In addition to bearish expectations for the report, analysts said some of this morning's selling was prompted by indications of strong farmer sales of grains and soybeans to commercial dealers during December. `` Especially considering the good movement after the first of the year, the commercials do n't have to reach for anything in here at all,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.39 -LCB- a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents lower with March at $ 2.84 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.35 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with January at $ 7.96 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .08 cent to .25 cent higher with February at 74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .10 cent higher with January at 85 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .23 cent higher with February at 42.02 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today extended its $ 1.4 billion unsolicited offer for textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for the seventh time, moving the deadline back another week. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> is fighting the $ 48-per-share offer, first made Oct. 25, with various takeover defenses, several of which have been struck down by a federal judge. The deadline, which was Wednesday at midnight, was extended exactly a week to this coming Wednesday at midnight. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> attorneys were at the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, asking judges there to reinstate `` poison pill'' provisions that had been thrown out by a lower court. In addition, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> representatives were negotiating Wednesday with the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Secretary of State's office to answer concerns raised about the deal's financing. Also, a federal judge received a written report from a court-appointed expert on <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s challenge of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law The `` poison pill,'' ruled illegal in November by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, would become effective after a shareholder had acquired 10 percent of the outstanding stock. Under its provisions, all but the large shareholder could then purchase more stock at a deep discount. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme boots, owns 9.8 percent, or 2.9 million shares, of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. Today, the company said approximately 14 million shares had been tendered, which would give the Chicago-based conglomerate control of about 57 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> shares, well short of the two-thirds requirement on which the offer is contingent. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> told the appeals court that <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> was incorrect when he ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> had no legal standing to question the amount of debt contained in <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer and that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was not bound by an agreement barring disclosure of confidential information obtained during <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. last year <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> contended during Wednesday's 90-minute hearing that the pill `` is a device by which the board of directors of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> says nobody can buy more than 10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said the investment firm was not bound by the standstill agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> advised, and <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> became the nation's largest publicly held textile company through a joint deal with <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. In any case, <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> had divulged no confidential information to <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. The judges gave no indication of when they would rule. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> said he did not know what negotiations were going on between <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleland </PERSON>, who last Friday ordered the company `` to provide assurance ... that the shareholders of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> will be fully informed as to the risks associated with both accepting and rejecting the <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> tender offer.'' Meanwhile, a court-appointed expert had turned in his findings to <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, who still must rule on <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s claims that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law _ which severely restricts mergers after takeovers _ is unconstitutional <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>'s ruling is expected later this week. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, manufactures Martex towels and Arrow shirts and has about a quarter of the nation's home fashion textile market. On Wednesday, the company also announced that its earnings for its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 24 fell 45.7 percent to $ 10.8 million, or 37 cents a share, from $ 19.9 million, or 64 cents a share a year ago. The drop was blamed on $ 17 million in special charges, including $ 3 million incurred in fighting <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. Its first-quarter revenue rose 42 percent to $ 683.1 million from $ 481 million a year earlier. The latest figures included sales from <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Six CBOT Members Suspended in Wig Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has fined and suspended six men linked to a scheme in which a trader donned a wig and used fake identification to access privileged information, CBOT officials said today. The six CBOT members were fined between $ 5,000 and $ 50,000 each and suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to 10 years. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s disciplinary bodies found all six engaged in what they called `` fraud and dishonorable and dishonest conduct'' and `` reckless and unbusinesslike dealings inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.'' None of the six could be reached today for comment. The traders were linked through federal court testimony last summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was sentenced last November to six years in prison. The disciplinary moves by the board, imposed Dec. 16 but announced this week, followed revelations by prosecutors in the Sanders probe. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 45, was found guilty of engineering the scheme in which <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> trader, donned a wig and used stolen trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area in proximity to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond trading pit. The government claimed that because of the disguises, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> and others in the scheme were able to claim $ 30,000 in trading profits without detection. <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison. The six suspended traders were identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schremser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinkade </PERSON>. Schremser and <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> testified under grants of immunity from prosecution at <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' trial, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> said. The CBOT board of governors imposed a 10-year suspension on <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, fined him $ 50,000 and barred him from associating with other members of the exchange during the suspension. <PERSON> Bretta </PERSON> was suspended for four years and fined $ 25,000. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was suspended for two years, <PERSON> Sutor </PERSON> was suspended for six months and fined $ 10,000. <PERSON> Kinkade </PERSON> was suspended for four months and fined $ 10,000 and <PERSON> Schremser </PERSON> was suspended for 15 days and fined $ 5,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said the investigation into corrupt trading practices is still continuing.

 The chief of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s powerful oil workers union was arraigned today on charges of illegal weapons possession, homicide, gun smuggling and resisting arrest. The arrest Tuesday of <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> prompted strikes by union members that crippled the country's nationalized oil industry for a day but ended Wednesday at a behest of a union official. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> was charged today before penal judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasco </PERSON>, who has 72 hours to decide whether the accused should be released on bail. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Hernanadez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> claimed the 200 Uzi machine guns seized in an assault on his home were smuggled from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and needed by union leaders for self-defense, officials said. At least 50 associates of the union boss arrested with him Tuesday face charges of fraud, weapons and tax evasion, said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general's office. A source in the office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that two of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s bodyguards on Wednesday accused their boss of ordering the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a union local. Tensions have long run high between <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> and newly inaugurated President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who has pledged to sell or close unprofitable or non-strategic state industries. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON>'s allegedly corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> controls more than half the lucrative drilling contracts issued by the state oil monopoly, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday that the production of crude oil, gasoline and petrochemicals had returned to normal. `` We are fulfilling all our exportation commitments to other countries,'' he said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the world's sixth-largest crude oil producer, and production from the country's nine refineries amounts to 1.4 million barrels a day. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, acting coordinator of the union, said the back-to-work appeal had come from <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, the union's secretary-general until Wednesday. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported later that leaders of the union's locals had designated <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camero </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>, a local leader and senator from the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madero </LOCATION>, the union's new secretary-general. Weapons were found at <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>'s home and he was under arrest, officials said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> told investigators the Uzis and about 30,000 cartridges were secretly delivered to him on Dec. 10 by former <ORGANIZATION> Reynosa </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, the attorney general's office said in a statement. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> said the arms were `` to defend his union members, given the existing situation in the country,'' the statement said. The government has not said what it thinks <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> planned to do with the weapons. Last week, the union chief threatened to paralyze the oil industry if the government carried out a threat to sell <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> operations to private investors. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> was arrested when soldiers blew down his door with a bazooka in a raid on his <ORGANIZATION> Ciudad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madero </ORGANIZATION> home. A federal agent was shot to death in the attack. A spokesman for the attorney general's office, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, said a paraffin test performed on <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> showed he had fired a gun. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did not elaborate. In his statement to investigators, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Galicia </PERSON> argued that security forces had no right to force their way into his home. He said he had planned to distribute some of the Uzis to other oil union leaders and said <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, whom he described as a `` good friend,'' did not charge him for the weapons and ammunition, the attorney general's office said. It did not say where in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the arms were bought.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which posted a record 85 percent increase in 1988 profit, announced Thursday it plans to launch a takeover bid for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest paper maker. Details of the `` friendly'' tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Aussedat-Rey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s leading manufacturer of photocopy paper, were not disclosed. But <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stock analysts estimated the bid at 650 to 700 French francs per share _ the equivalent of $ 104 to $ 113 based on Thursday's exchange rates. Officials of the Paris-based company declined to comment on whether the company would accept the offer. International Paper spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvernail </PERSON> said that under French law the company was barred from releasing details pending government approval. International Paper is the world's largest manufacturer of paper and paper products, with primary production facilities in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and throughout the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and packaging plants in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In addition to all types of business paper, the company makes milk cartons, bottle labels and corrugated boxes. It does not make newsprint. International Paper announced earlier this week that preliminary figures show its earnings soared last year, due to strong demand and high operating capacity. For the 12 months ended last Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> said its net income totaled $ 754 million, or $ 6.57 a share, up from $ 407 million, or $ 3.68 a share, in 1987. The company's annual revenue rose 22 percent to $ 9.5 billion from $ 7.8 billion in 1987. The company reported that its fourth-quarter net earnings jumped 65 percent to $ 206 million, or $ 1.81 a share, on sales of $ 2.5 billion. In the year-earlier quarter the company reported earnings of $ 125 million, or $ 1.14 a share, on sales of $ 2 billion. `` Our white paper, market pulp and packaging businesses turned in particularly impressive results in 1988,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> said that for the second year in a row, the company's paper and paperboard mills operated at or near capacity `` This strong level of demand led to higher prices on most of our major product lines and we compounded the benefits by continuing to emphasize cost reduction, customer service and quality,'' he said. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> said the company planned to invest $ 900 million in 1989 to further modernize its facilities and would continue to search for new investment opportunities.

 Major commercial banks say they should receive loan guarantees from governments or agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> before they lend out any more money to debt-ridden Third World countries. `` Creditor countries risk that some of these debtor countries will default on their debt,'' explained <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulmann </PERSON>, the West German managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>. `` If this happens ... the banks of the creditor countries will suffer heavy losses.''

Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the choice of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become secretary of state, has strongly opposed official guarantees because they transfer to taxpayers the risks taken by private lenders.

<HEAD>Chemical Reports Jump In 4th Qtr Profit, Record Annual Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest banking companies, on Thursday reported a 26 percent jump in its fourth-quarter profit and record earnings for 1988. The company attributed those gains partly to a decrease in its provision for future loan losses from Third World countries and past-due interest payments from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $ 288.5 million, or $ 4.66 a share, up from $ 229.6 million, or $ 3.83 a share, the same time a year earlier. The 1987 quarterly earnings included a $ 126.4 million pre-tax gain on a pension settlement and $ 25.6 million from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>'s factoring business. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>'s profit totaled a record $ 753.6 million, or $ 12.02 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $ 853.7 million. The 1988 figures included pre-tax gains of $ 53.8 million on the settlement of a portion of its pension obligations and $ 41.3 million on the sale or closure of non-strategic businesses and the receipt of about $ 161 million in past-due interest from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> from Feb. 20, 1987 to Sept. 30, 1988. The 1987 earnings reflected the company's decision to add nearly $ 1.5 billion to its loan-loss provision at the peak of the Third World debt crisis. During that year <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> had placed a moratorium on interest payments to commercial banks. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> added around $ 364 million to its loan-loss provision, including $ 81 million in the final quarter. The 1987 fourth-quarter provision was $ 108 million. Chemical said fourth-quarter operating earnings reflected increases in corporate finance fees, earnings from equity affiliates and declines in non-interest expense, as well as the smaller loan-loss provision. It said a drop in net interest income, bond trading and foreign-exchange profits helped partially offset those gains. The huge profit for 1988 was largely attributed to an increase in net interest income, corporate finance fees, profits from bond trading and the lower loan-loss provision. The 1988 results also included full-year earnings from <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which merged with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 2.1 million last year, compared with a $ 120.3 million loss in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Maker of World Famous Miniature Cameras Fights to Stay Afloat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIESSEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The maker of Minox miniature cameras, the `` spy cameras'' made famous in an early <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movie, has racked up big losses, sought bankruptcy-court protection and cut its workforce by 50 percent in a struggle to stay in the Japanese-dominated market. <PERSON> Minox </PERSON>'s woes are just part of the restructuring of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s proud camera industry, which has seen the only other two all-German companies, <PERSON> Leica </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rollei </PERSON>, drop out of the amateur automatic focus camera market to concentrate on producing high-priced professional gear <PERSON> Minox </PERSON>, which continues to pursue the amateur photographer market in tough competition with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s producers, is based in the central West German town of <LOCATION> Heuchelheim </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The so-called `` spy camera'' used in the 1963 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movie `` From <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> With Love'' can be concealed in the palm or easily slipped into a normal pocket. A newer version, the <ORGANIZATION> Minox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, is even smaller, about as long and thick as a normal index finger, and not more that two-fingers wide. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON>, who died in 1942, invented the tiny camera in 1938 in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. His descendants founded the Minox company in <LOCATION> Heuchelheim </LOCATION> on Jan. 3, 1949. Exactly 40 years later, <PERSON> Minox </PERSON> filed for bankruptcy-court protection and a court-appointed executive entrusted with running the company cut 220 of its 564 employees. The reduction followed a cut of 186 employees last April. `` This is really hurting <PERSON> Heuchelheim </PERSON>,'' the town's mayor <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview at his office earlier this month. `` Not only the jobs, but also the taxes. We may have to reduce some town services,'' the mayor said. The town has a population of 7,500. Loss of the jobs also means small businesses in <LOCATION> Heuchelheim </LOCATION> will lose the customers who used to go shopping there after work, <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said. `` But I guess the worst part is the months of uncertainty that the families have gone through for the past months. Some have spent their whole lives at <LOCATION> Minox </LOCATION>, others had grandfathers and fathers who also worked there,'' he said. <PERSON> Minox </PERSON> has not shown a profit since 1981, and on April 1, 1988, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corduwener </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> businessman bought a 51 percent share of the company to take control from the <PERSON> Rinn </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Corduwener </PERSON> immediately cut the workforce to streamline the operation, but even with $ 40 million in sales in 1988, the company lost $ 3.4 million for the year. Its debts swelled to $ 25.7 million. Despite forecasts that business was rebounding with three months of orders to fill on its new 35 GT-E and 35 AF -LRB- Automatic Focus -RRB- cameras, the company's applications for short-term bank loans were rejected. Employees took out private loans to tide them over during November and December because <PERSON> Minox </PERSON> had no money for salaries. They worked extra shifts to fill contract obligations and keep the firm in operation, mayor <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said. Many had hoped their loyality would convince the banks, primarily the Frankfurt-based <ORGANIZATION> Commerzbank </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION>'s Bezirksparkasse bank, to continue to help <PERSON> Minox </PERSON>, but the hope backfired on those who were layed off, he said. While <PERSON> Minox </PERSON> is struggling, the <LOCATION> Leica </LOCATION> company in nearby <ORGANIZATION> Wetzlar </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Rollei </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Braunschweig </LOCATION>, report business has been good over the past year. <PERSON> Leica </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Zydowitz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> company officals estimate last year's sales at about $ 60.6 million, but he declined to estimate profits. Spokesman <PERSON> Dietmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanzer </PERSON> of the smaller <PERSON> Rollei </PERSON> company, which employs about 270 people, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> the firm had great success with its new Roliflex 6008 camera in 1988. He estimated 1988 sales at $ 20 million but also declined to estimate profits.

<HEAD>GEC, Siemens Temporarily Blocked From Plessey Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government on Thursday temporarily barred <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> from proceeding with their hostile, $ 3.6 billion takeover bid for British defense contractor <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he referred the bid to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to determine its effects on competition, particularly in defense electronics and air traffic control Young asked the commission to make its recommendation within three months. During that time the bidders can not proceed with their offer and are limited to a <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> holding of under 15 percent. Following the ruling, the British and German partners raised their stake in <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> to about 14.9 percent from about 3 percent. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it would investigate the joint bid, which might break Common Market competition rules. The commission was requesting information from the companies involved and hoped to complete the inquiry `` as soon as possible,'' said a spokesman for <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, a Briton who is the new European commissioner for competition policy. The developments came amid expectations that a newly formed international consortium, expected to include <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, would make a bid for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION>, a British electronics giant that is unrelated to the similarly named <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company. The potential bid for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> was expected to be worth between $ 11.6 billion and $ 14.3 billion, which would make it the largest takeover ever on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Such a counterbid would be what Wall Street calls a `` Pac Man'' defense because of its similarity to the eat-or-be-eaten video game. After the British government's announcement, <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 4.39 a share in a midmorning raid that increased their joint stake in <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> to the maximum allowed, said <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, broker to the companies. By paying $ 4.39 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> stock, the bidders are forced by British takeover rules to raise their offer to at least that price if they get clearance to proceed. A bid at that price would value the whole of <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 3.3 billion. The previous offer of $ 4.03 a share, which automatically lapsed, valued <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION>, a West German electronics maker, said they would cooperate with the British inquiry `` in the belief that the proposed merger will be allowed to proceed in due course.'' <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> shares finished 13 cents higher at $ 4.17 on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> shares ended up 4 cents at $ 3.85. The GEC-Siemens bid has come under heavy political pressure in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and a referral to the mergers commission had been considered likely. The government blocked a solo bid from <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, saying it would harm competition in the British defense electronics market. But many analysts expect the government to allow it to proceed this time. <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said it would not relax its attempts to fight the GEC-Siemens bid. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said his company would explore various means to maximize shareholder benefits. The statement was believed to be a reference to <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>'s expected role in the efforts to build a consortium bid for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metsun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a shell company set up to lead any bid for <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION>, said talks on a possible offer were continuing. The offer would lead to the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> GEC </ORGANIZATION> and the sale some of its businesses. Analysts said the investigations could hinder the negotiations, which are being conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>'s adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, because the referral indicated that any further bid in the industry also would be referred to the commission.

The ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> after a brief hearing means jury selection for a new trial will commence next Tuesday in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s court, lawyers involved in the case said. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> decreed a mistrial Tuesday in the first major case arising from the Wall Street insider trading scandal to reach the trial phase. She based the ruling on a prosecutorial blunder in handling a key piece of evidence. The judge ordered a new trial, but lawyers for the chemical company and vice chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> appealed on grounds of double jeopardy, the legal principle that protects defendants from two trials for the same offense. Defense lawyers routinely object to new trials when mistrials are declared, but the strategy's success depends on the circumstances of the case. In instances of prosecutorial misconduct, the defense generally has to prove that prosecutors deliberately provoked a mistrial because they feared they would lose and wanted a second chance. But Judge <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said she believed the prosecution's mistake in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case was unintentional, which weighed heavily in the appeals court's support of her decision to proceed with a new trial. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were indicted in July for an alleged scheme to manipulate up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in order to maximize <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s gain from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> shares it wished to sell after a failed takeover attempt. The prosecution has based its case largely on the testimony of ex-broker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, whose Los Angeles-based securities firm conducted the alleged manipulation on <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s behalf. Jefferies himself was implicated in wrongdoing by inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is now imprisoned.

 Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual funds rose $ 4.36 billion in the latest week to an all-time high of $ 282.4 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $ 449.5 million drop in fund assets the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. `` In a sharp reversal of the end-of-the-year decline, assets of money market funds staged an impressive advance to reach an all-time high record,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of the group. The new record eclipses the previous all-time high of $ 281.89 billion reported in the week ended Nov. 23. The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $ 9.64 billion in the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 225 general purpose funds rose $ 239.5 million to $ 90.17 billion, assets of 91 broker-dealer funds rose $ 3.61 billion to $ 119.28 billion, and assets of 137 institutional funds rose $ 519.2 million to $ 72.94 billion. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.28 percent from 8.39 percent the previous week, according to <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield rose to 8.22 percent from 8.14 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 30 days, up from 29 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 6.24 percent as of Wednesday from 6.22 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, rose to 5.14 percent from 5.13 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.26 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.21 the previous week. Yields were 8.51 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.48 percent; 8.63 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, up from 8.58 percent; and 8.75 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.71 percent

 Fried chicken king <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> may resume his $ 290 million takeover attempt against <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. `` I'm delighted,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ the company which owns <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popeyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Famous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> _ after Judge <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Politz </PERSON> announced the decision for the three-judge 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel. `` The stay is lifted,'' said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. `` We'll move forward with all haste, and leave it to the shareholders as to whether or not to believe our offer is a reasonable one.'' A hearing is set Wednesday in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where Popeyes is fighting `` poison pill'' anti-takeover bylaws which Church's adopted Nov. 4, more than a week after Popeyes made its offer. Church's is headquartered in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` I do n't consider that a major obstacle,'' said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. The judges announced their decision 35 minutes after arguments were over. They did not go into their reasons for upholding the ruling handed down Nov. 28 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, saying only that they affirmed it on all points. `` We neither approve nor disapprove of the reasons for that decision,'' <PERSON> Politz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Struve </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing Church's, said he was disappointed and did not know when the chain would decide whether to appeal Thursday's ruling. <PERSON> Struve </PERSON> argued that the $ 8-a-share takeover bid should be halted because it was based on insider information provided by a former <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s executive now employed by Popeyes, and because merging the nation's No. 2 and 3 fried chicken chains would violate federal antitrust laws. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadet </PERSON> of the corporate law firm of <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION> said Popeyes could give <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s notice on Thursday that it planned to proceed with the takeover attempt and deliver the information to <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s after five business days Popeyes would have 12 more business days after that to close the deal, he said. The chain has said that it owns 3.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and has been tendered another 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the 35.9 million shares outstanding.

 Stock prices rolled up their sixth gain in the past seven sessions Thursday, extending the early-1989 rally that has carried the market to its highest levels since the 1987 crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.89 points to 2,222.32 _ less than 25 points shy of its close of 2,246.74 on Oct. 16, 1987, just before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 907 up, 586 down and 496 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 183 million shares, up from 148.95 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 215.92 million shares. Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's drive Wednesday past the 2,200 level in the Dow after a week-long struggle. In addition, they cited a developing `` bandwagon'' effect as investors who had been bearish on the outlook for months felt increasing pressure to join in the rally. The market's steady advance since last fall has come without any support from interest rates, which have been rising. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has continued to tighten credit, and many Wall Streeters still believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might soon raise its discount rate. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 59 ~; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> ~ to 123 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> | to 45; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> \ to 29 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> \ to 52 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lived up to traders' hopes, raising its quarterly dividend from 60 to 75 cents a share. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 -RRB- to 24. The company asked its holders to take no action on <ORGANIZATION> Vernitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 23 a share until <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> directors study the bid and make a recommendation on whether the accept or reject it. <ORGANIZATION> Dexter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the subject of rumors about a possible takeover or restructuring, picked up 2 \ to 25 -RCB- The company said it had no news pending to account for the activity. <ORGANIZATION> Novo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industri </ORGANIZATION> rose 3 to 42 -LCB-. The company plans to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Nordisk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gentofte </ORGANIZATION>, another Danish concern. <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 \ to 11 ~ in the over-the-counter The company said <ORGANIZATION> Emigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> proposed to acquire it for $ 16 a share. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 10.20 billion, or 0.37 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks added .61 to 159.26. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.70 to 327.99, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.16 at 283.17 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.70 to 387.01.

 Share prices finished broadly higher in brisk trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the market's advances led by heavy activity in electrical stocks as well as by an early rally on Wall Street The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 16.8 points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,850.9, its best level for the day. At its minimum, the index was up just 0.5 point shortly after the start of trading. The market has shown persistent strength in recent sessions, with the 100-share index gaining nearly 70 points since Tuesday of last week. `` The market just does n't want to go down,'' one dealer said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index rose 13.1 points to 1,511.9 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 8.92 points to close at 1,041.79. Volume was heavy, expanding to 791.3 million shares from Wednesday's 581.3 million. A large portion of Thursday's turnover was in <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose shares were snatched up in a midmorning raid. A joint venture of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> bought about 89 million <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> shares shortly after Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> referred their bid for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a study of its impact on competition Market excitement faded shortly after midday once the GEC-Siemens buying spree ended, as the companies approached the limit of 14.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> shares that British authorities imposed. But the market picked up again as Wall Street pushed ahead in early trading. As <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading finished, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was up 16.43 points at 2,222.86.

<HEAD>Plans to End Merger Pact, Sell Oster-Sunbeam to Black &amp; Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Thursday to cancel a merger agreement with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities firm in favor of a deal to sell its core <ORGANIZATION> Oster-Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> division to <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 260 million. The proposed sale is the centerpiece of an independent plan of reorganization that management intends to present in bankruptcy court, where creditors had backed the proposal from the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The company also said it entered a letter of intent with Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellog </PERSON>, head of a shareholders' committee that had previously battled management, to finance management's plan. The Oster-Sunbeam division makes a range of small household appliances, including shavers, mixers and other kitchen appliances. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, manufactures and sells power tools, accessories, household appliances and lawn care equipment. Under management's plan, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> would be left with businesses that include lawn furniture, gas grills, electric blankets, scales and clocks, among other things. `` The consensus is they just abdicated,'' unsecured creditors' counsel <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> said after the board confirmed published reports that it voted down the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> plan on Wednesday `` It's time the creditors take control of the case,'' he said. In voting to cancel its earlier tentative merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION>, the board cited the securities firm's subsequent arrangement with a rival bidder, the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> merchant banker group, to carve up the company between them <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it would ask <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> and against the Levy group. In its latest version, the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> plan would have sold <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s lawn furniture and gas grill business to the <ORGANIZATION> Levy </ORGANIZATION> group for about $ 250 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> would have retained the Oster-Sunbeam division. In another late change, <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Jenrette would have put $ 30 million less common equity into the deal than it had earlier proposed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had asked the bankruptcy court to void the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` We were surprised, we're disappointed and we're examining our options,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a partner in the Levy group. `` We're amazed and disappointed that the board, having postponed a decision from November to December and then from December to January has now rejected the sale route altogether,'' said <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an adviser to the unsecured creditors. The board announced a tentative merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> last November after the major creditor groups shot down an earlier reorganization plan from management and forced the board to offer the company for sale. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> both made independent buyout proposals. The board twice endorsed the securities firm's offer, only to withdraw support when <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> sweetened its bid Both plans would have repaid creditors nearly in full. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> would have given stockholders 40 percent of the reorganized company, which would have closely resembled the current <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The Levy group would have given shareholders 49 percent equity in what was left after selling the Oster-Sunbeam unit to reduce debt.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies Thursday but its increase was modest, a sign of the success of central banks' efforts to halt its recent ascent. Gold prices rose. Foreign-exchange dealers said trading was cautious in the aftermath of Wednesday's concerted dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and at least eight other central banks. `` They -LRB- central banks -RRB- have in fact capped the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said there was strong support for the dollar at current levels, meaning the currency is `` trapped'' for now in a narrow trading range. `` The market just seemed to be settling in ranges,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, corporate foreign-exchange manager for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7880 late Thursday, more expensive for buyers that Wednesday's late $ 1.7815.

<HEAD>Bear Stearns Posts Highest Quarterly Profit; Announces Stock Buyback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At a time when many securities firms have suffered an earnings slump, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced the best quarterly earnings in its history Thursday, more than a 125-fold gain over the year earlier period Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> also said it would repurchase up to 4.8 percent of its stock in the next four weeks, which analysts called a reflection of self-confidence in an era largely colored by post-crash uncertainty. The company said earnings for the second quarter ended Dec. 31 increased to $ 63.3 million from $ 500,000 in the comparable period of 1987. Per-share earnings totaled 73 cents, vs. none a year earlier because of special payments to preferred shareholders. Revenue for the quarter totaled $ 624.6 million, up 41 percent from the $ 442 million for the same period a year earlier. For the six months ended Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 83.8 million or 94 cents a share, up 206 percent from $ 27.4 million or 26 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue for the six-month period totaled $ 1.1 billion, up from $ 906.6 million for the same period a year earlier. Many Wall Street firms involved primarily in retail brokerage posted lackluster results last year, reflecting a flight from stocks following the October 1987 crash. However, firms involved primarily in investment banking, such as financing corporate takeovers, fared better. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said results for the latest quarter reflected strong performance in `` principal transaction'' business _ management of its own money _ and its investment banking activities. The firm would not provide figures for the retail business, one of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION>' six areas of operation, but analysts said it was doing poorly. `` Some of the decisions made in October 1987 -LRB- not to retrench after the crash -RRB- are starting to have a very positive impact on our bottom line,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive officer. `` We are particularly proud that our head count is approximately the same as it was before October 1987 and we have not eliminated any lines of business,'' he said, alluding to layoffs and cutbacks at competitors. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> has about 6,000 employees in 13 offices worldwide. Under the stock repurchase plan, <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> said it will buy back up to 4 million of its shares by Feb. 10, approximately 4.8 percent of the total amount outstanding, at a cost of between $ 12.25 to $ 14 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 13.25 a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down 50 cents from Wednesday. The company said it considered the stock buyback an attractive investment and an appropriate use of available cash. Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> was a partnership before it went public in October 1985, and about half its stock is owned by current and former employees, said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a stock analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She called the stock buyback `` a vote of confidence'' in the company Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> also announced it had increased its quarterly dividend on common stock to 14 cents a share from 12 -LCB- cents, payable March 15.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The growth in money supply in 1988 was within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 3.1 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,068.7 billion from $ 3,065.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased $ 4.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,905.0 billion from $ 3,900.3 billion. M2 grew 5.4 percent and M3 grew 6.3 percent in 1988, according to a comparison of the last 13 weeks of 1988 with the last 13 weeks of 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had aimed at growth of 4 percent to 8 percent in the two money supply measures in the year. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $ 6.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 793.1 billion from $ 786.4 billion. Its growth in 1988 was 4.3 percent. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively set a target of M2 growth of 3 percent to 7 percent and M3 growth of 3.5 to 7.5 percent in 1989. There again is no target for M1 growth. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,053.6 billion, a 3.0 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,888.1 billion, up 4.2 percent, while M1 rose 1.2 percent to an average of $ 785.2 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 663 million in the week ended Jan. 4, compared with a gain of $ 173 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 309 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 1.372 billion in the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 151 million in the two-week period ended Jan. 11, down from a revised $ 741 million in the previous two-week period _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 287.9 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 285.0 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Renewed Supply Fears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices surged Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange amid signs of tightening supplies and production problems against a backdrop of steady demand. On other markets, precious metals finished mixed; coffee futures ended higher; grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures were mostly higher; cattle futures were higher; pork futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Copper settled 0.30 cent to 4.35 cents higher with the spot price at $ 1.489 a pound and the most active futures contract, for delivery in March, at $ 1.379 a pound. The advance followed five straight days of declines in both the spot price and the March contract. Analysts said buying interest was piqued by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 500-ton decline Wednesday in inventories of copper for delivery against futures contracts. The decline, which brought the exchange's warehouse stocks to 12,459 tons, indicated strong demand for immediate delivery of copper, they said. Further buying was linked to rumors that the Chilean copper company <ORGANIZATION> Codelco </ORGANIZATION> was considering shutting down its smelter at <ORGANIZATION> Chuquicamata </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest copper mine, due to persistent mechanical problems, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the world's top copper producer in 1987, fell short of its 1988 production goal by 85 tons due to production problems, <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. He said labor problems had resurfaced in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest copper producer, where a 57-day miners' strike late last year contributed to a 100,000-ton drop in annual copper production And copper production in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the fourth - and fifth-largest producers, fell by 135,000 metric tons last year due to mechanical and transportation difficulties, he said Meanwhile, copper consumption is at its seasonal peak, and projections for continued economic expansion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> suggest that strong demand for the metal will continue, analysts said. `` It's a very tight market,'' <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> said. Analyst <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the copper market seemed unsinkable, even though prices have fallen from the record highs reached in early December. Gold advanced marginally while silver futures fell for the fourth straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 50 cents to 60 cents higher with February at $ 405.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1.5 cents lower with March at $ 5.985 a troy ounce. Coffee futures ended higher in a day of volatile trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following a dramatic plunge on Wednesday. Coffee settled 0.5 cent to 3.3 cents higher with March at $ 1.4211 a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders adjusted their positions ahead of Friday's crop report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures finished mostly lower for the third consecutive session amid jitters about an expected increase over last year in winter wheat plantings. The figure is the most eagerly awaited statistic in the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report, and analysts' estimates have varied widely. The crop report, due out after Friday's close of trading, also will contain the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s final 1988 crop production totals, new estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles and estimates for 1989 corn and soybean acreage. Wheat settled 3 \ cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 4.41 \ a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.86 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.37 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to 1 \ cents higher with January at $ 7.98 -LCB- Most energy futures prices finished moderately higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after falling earlier in the day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 cents higher with February at $ 18.17 a barrel; heating oil was .85 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 52.84 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .50 cent to .74 cent higher with February at 49.27 cents a gallon. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .10 cent to .22 cent higher with February at 74.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher with January at 85.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 45.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .47 cent to .87 cent higher with February at 42.70 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .85 point higher at 285.25.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, picked Thursday by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, brings to the job an expertise in an area that has emerged as the department's biggest headache: nuclear weapons <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, National Laboratory. He was an instructor at naval nuclear power training centers in 1960 and four years later took command of the nuclear-powered submarine Snook. The Oak Ridge lab is one link in the Energy Department's nationwide network of reactors and other nuclear weapons facilities The aging complex has been crippled recently by a series of safety and environmental problems, leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> temporarily unable to produce tritium, a radioactive gas that is vital to making nuclear warheads. One of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' main tasks, if he is confirmed in the post by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would be to guide the department's mounting efforts to rebuild the nuclear arms plants and clean up the environmental damage caused by four decades of bomb-making. For two years before becoming a nuclear sub commander, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was an administrative assistant in the Naval Reactors Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the forerunner of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> biography. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, capped his 41-year Naval career with a four-year stint as chief of naval operations, the service's top post, in the rank of admiral. He retired in 1986. Although some of his closest friends advised him against it, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> accepted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request in October 1987 to head an AIDS study commission that had been rocked by internal disarray and widespread public ridicule. Under <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' leadership the AIDS panel produced a series of widely praised recommendations. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is described by associates as a clear-thinker who blends practical experience with political savvy. `` People can anticipate that he is a studied person, that is, he will study the issues in great depth,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who served with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> in 1978-79. `` He's a blend of nuclear submariner ... and a good judge of people.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Alhambra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> harbor, on March 7, 1927. His mother, <PERSON> LouiseWard </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, ran unsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, one of the few women of her time to run for national office. He later recalled that his mother would take him to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ports to watch the big ships come and go. She sometimes arranged to get aboard the ships, where they dined with officers and heard tales about life on the high seas. Inspired by those stories, and his first-hand look at sailors, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> decided to seek a life in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. He entered the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in 1945, just as World War II was drawing to a close. He graduated in 1949. Afterward, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> served aboard destroyers and submarines, earned a master's degree at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postgraduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and then made one of the key decisions in his career: specializing in the field of nuclear submarines. He became a confidante of Adm. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickover </PERSON>, the father of the modern nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the man who played a key role in the careers of dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Rising within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s ranks, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> became commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, based at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. In March 1982, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose him as chief of naval operations. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> helped oversee the big naval buildup, from 450 to nearly 600 ships, that was at the heart of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's defense policy in the president's first term <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and his wife of 38 years, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, have raised six children.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A congressional hearing convened to `` clean up the mess'' in the nation's savings and loans was told Thursday that more than $ 220 million in losses from insider fraud have been uncovered in thrifts in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The disclosure was contained in a half-inch-thick statement from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON>, whose jurisdiction includes the three states, testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cirona </PERSON> said that since August of 1987 his investigators had referred 5,384 cases of possible fraud or abuse to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. The statement given to the lawmakers said many of the cases `` involve rather small amounts obtained fraudulently by borrowers or depositors.'' `` However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders, which may often involve very large sums of money,'' it said. `` For this reason we have established a special system of ` priority referrals' that involves insiders or amounts in excess of $ 100,000. `` We estimate that losses to 11th District institutions on these priority referrals, as of September 23, 1988, amounted to over $ 220 million.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called for a full analysis of the crisis in the savings and loans industry, in which government bailouts exceeded $ 38 billion in 1988. Estimates of the cost to rescue the remaining 350 or so involvent thrifts have ranged from $ 50 billion to $ 75 billion. The hearing was needed to `` clean up the mess that is already out there,'' said the congressman, adding that more hearings would be held in other major cities. `` With both banks and savings and loans failing in record numbers, it is imperative that this committee fully understands how the problems have developed in the industry and the manner in which state and federal regulatory agencies have responded to the crisis,'' he said. The lawmakers need to talk to the `` people who deal with these problems on a day-to-day basis,'' he said. `` For too long there has been an overdependence on the wisdom of Washington-based bureaucrats far removed from the scene of battle.'' The hearing was scheduled to continue Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced plans to sell two of its daily newspapers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Star-News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The company has owned the <ORGANIZATION> Star-News </ORGANIZATION> since 1956. The Post-Tribune was purchased in 1966. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> will be represented in the sale of the two newspapers by Goldman-Sachs. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> declined to reveal any asking price for the papers. `` The decision to sell these two newspapers was not an easy one,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. `` Both papers have excellent leadership teams and fine editors, writers and executives throughout their organizations. But it is important to our shareholders and the future of our organization that its individual components fit the overall strategic and growth needs of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said an analysis of the company's holdings led management to conclude that <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> would benefit from selling the two newspapers. `` Proceeds will be used to reduce the company's debt, repurchase the company's stock or make strategic acquisitions,'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. `` We will be most inclined to consider offers from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> publishers who recognize the full value of these newspapers and whose track records suggest that they would take seriously the newspapers' responsibility to readers, advertisers and the communities to be served,'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. Also on Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> announced that it has named <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinks </PERSON> publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, succeeding <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>, who will be the newspaper's chairman. Jinks had been senior vice president for news and operations. The appointment is effective April 1. Last April, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors authorized the repurchase of 5 million shares of the company's stock. At its December meeting, the board authorized the repurchase of an additional 5 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> currently has 30 newspapers as well as business information services and cable television operations.

 A foul smell permeates the warehouses where bundles of used plastic milk jugs and laundry detergent bottles are stacked to the ceiling. But to <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION>, the odor is the sweet smell of success. Once the smelly containers are cleaned and ground up at the plant, the used plastic, or `` post-consumer'' plastic, can be sold for about 40 cents a pound. Manufacturers of products as diverse as pipes, flower pots and toys are eager to buy the recycled plastic. The price for new plastic has tripled in the past year to about 60 cents a pound. There's a ready source of supply, too. Many communities running out of landfill space are eager to ship their bulky, plastic garbage to the <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> plant, called <LOCATION> Eaglebrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a branch of <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The plant pays $ 100 to $ 150 per ton of used plastic, depending on how clean and sorted it is. Plastics manufacturers have re-ground their own factory waste _ `` pre-consumer'' plastic _ for years. Only recently have they begun to consider containers discarded by consumers as a viable source of lower-grade plastic. It sounds simple, but finding an efficient and profitable process for recycling plastic has eluded the materials recovery field for years because impurities interfere in the reprocessing. `` There is a great demand for recovered plastic, but the material has to be clean,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION>. `` Community recycling centers had to rely on the consumer to wash the bottles thoroughly and strip off the paper labels. `` That's a lot of work for a person, and so about 98 percent of those used containers ended up in the landfill. Our process frees the consumer, and the community recycling center, from the labor needed to clean those containers,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. The company developed what it affectionately calls `` Mr. Clean,'' a $ 200,000 machine that scrubs labels and bits of food from the once-smelly empties. Once they are clean, the plastic containers are ground into a grainy substance and packaged for sale. <PERSON> Eaglebrook </PERSON> opened shop in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> about five years ago with $ 10,000 and an answering machine. It now has annual sales of $ 5 million and 50 employees, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. Once the business took hold in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eaglebrook </LOCATION> officials decided the company needed an East Coast location. `` We chose <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> because we're trying to access the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> market but we wanted to be outside the high-priced metropolitan area,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eaglebrook </PERSON>'s vice president. <LOCATION> Eaglebrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> opened in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> in April. It expects to post $ 2.5 million in sales for 1988. The company said there's such a tremendous source of raw materials that the <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> operation's 10 employees keep the plant running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. About 2.2 billion pounds of high-density polyethylene plastic containers are produced each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> says it will recover more than 3 million pounds of that. The company takes plastic waste from just about anywhere. <LOCATION> Eaglebrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> has contracts with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> recycler, two counties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It also occasionally receives shipments from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> plant also will clean `` pre-consumer'' waste shipped to it by plastics manufacturers. In fact, only about 20 percent of the first 250 tons of plastic the company received fell into the post-consumer category. To promote recycling, <LOCATION> Eaglebrook </LOCATION> is creating a line of products that are manufactured from reprocessed plastic. Plastic from used milk jugs, which is dyed shades of brown and rust, is being formed into shapes that resemble wooden planks and sold for building decks. Eaglebrook is `` probably the largest of the proprietary recyclers,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Journal of the Society of the Plastics Industry. The trade journal lists about two columns of recyclers, and all most likely have automated washing systems like Mr. Clean, she said. But `` it's likely that they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have the best,'' <PERSON> Vadney </PERSON> said.
