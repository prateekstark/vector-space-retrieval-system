 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> on Friday issued a plea to striking miners to end their unauthorized walkouts and workers in at least three states planned to return to the coal mines. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> also declared an end to the union's weeklong authorized work stoppage that idled 60,000 union miners east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I am personally asking our members to suspend their protest actions,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said in a news release. At least 37,000 miners in eight states in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were on unauthorized wildcat strikes before this week. The wildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of 1,900 union members on strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a contract dispute. In southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a wildcat strike by 1,750 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members was suspended Friday. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 5,000 union miners also would return to work Sunday night, said a union official there. And <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> union representatives said striking miners were planning to return to work. But in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 wildcat strikers in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said they would not return to work. `` We told our people to go back to work, but they told us ` No,''' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1071, said late Friday. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has maintained it has not asked the workers to stay away from the coal mines; and many UMW rank-and-file have ignored back-to-work orders from judges. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> asked the wildcat strikers to return to work until July 26, when the union's international executive board meets. `` As the regular work schedule resumes on Monday and our members return to work, we assume that the industry will cooperate with our efforts to help restore stability in the coal fields,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. `` I think by and large things should go back to normalcy on Monday,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said miners would continue the `` memorial'' or cooling off periods in <LOCATION> UMW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 31 </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> from next Monday through Thursday and in <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 6 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Northern Panhandle from next Wednesday through Friday. The announcement came during another day of unrest in the coal fields. Two mine employees were wounded by gunfire in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and a car bomb exploded at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. A federal judge Friday also called on the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, to meet with him to find out what has stalled contract negotiations between the two sides <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> went on strike April 5 after working 18 months without a contract. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> on Monday began a three-day cooling-off period, which was extended Wednesday. The days off without pay _ 10 of which are allowed the the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ were aimed at easing coal field tensions, but unrest and violence has continued. A bomb went off in a car parked at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters, said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Police Sgt <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. There were no injuries, and no arrests were made, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. The bomb destroyed a vehicle that <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> said was owned by a replacement worker hired during the strike against the company. `` We're very concerned about incidents such as this,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. She said security would be increased at the headquarters. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said he and other union officials were unaware of the explosion. He said it would be wrong to blame the union when no arrest has been made. At least one other car bombing and two failed attempts at car bombings have been reported by police during the strikes in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Two employees of non-union <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> were hit by buck shot Friday morning as they were replacing paint-splattered windows that had protected a camera surveillance system, said company President <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. No arrests were made, officials said. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the wildcat strike was scheduled to be suspended at midnight Friday, a union official said. `` Members will be returning to work,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, international executive board member for the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s District 11. `` We have suspended the protest for right now,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> added that the order to ask <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> workers to return came at the same time <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> made his plea. `` They're going back because I asked them to,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` I felt there were some positive things happening down in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and recommended we go back to work. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 12 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said 8,500 striking <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> miners would be returning to work in shifts throughout the weekend. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the miners would be notified Saturday to `` return to work at the next available shift,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer for <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 20.

<HEAD>Environmental Groups Offer Plan Allowing Some Logging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB BAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists offered a plan Friday aimed at preserving ancient forests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> while allowing timber companies to cut down more trees. The federal government has been prevented from selling many older forest stands to timber companies because of court injunctions won by environmental groups, who argued the stands may be the last remaining habitat for the Northern spotted owl. The injunctions have drastically reduced the supply of logs for lumber mills in the Northwest. The plan offered Friday would release 490 million board feet of timber currently barred from logging under court injunctions. A compromise plan worked out at a meeting of environmentalists, timber industry officials and politicians last month went up in smoke when some environmental groups said it allowed for too much logging. Reaction to the latest proposal was mixed. `` I'm encouraged,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` I think it's a thoughtful albeit somewhat complicated response. But <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorlin </PERSON>, press secretary to Rep. <PERSON> Less </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ore </LOCATION>, said: `` It raises as many questions as it seems to answer.'' And <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Geisinger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan strayed too far from the original framework for the summit compromise. `` They want to be in charge of managing the national forests,'' said <PERSON> Geisinger </PERSON>, who represented the timber industry at the summit. `` I do n't think we are prepared to turn that responsibility over to them.'' Overall, the environmentalists offer would allow 9.6 billion board feet of federal timber to be harvested in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the next 15 months. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, conservation dirrector of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resouces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized at a news conference Friday that the offer covered only the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years. The harvest level is 400 million board feet less than was proposed in the plan developed at the June 24 summit. Although the environmentalists called their proposal `` a minor reduction,'' congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the 400 million amounted to enough timber to supply four medium-sized mills with logs for a year. Under the plan, 3.7 billion board feet would be available for harvest in national forests the remainder of this fiscal year, 3.9 billion could be harvested on national forests in the 1990 fiscal year and a billion could be harvested on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> land in each of the two fiscal years. `` A lot of this was difficult because we are bleeding,'' <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> said. `` This plan is not sustainable for timber production and not sustainable for spotted owl production.'' Any long-term plan, he said, would have to provide more severe limits on federal logging, with a greater emphasis on improving production on private timberland. The plan would allow harvesting of small, fragmented stands; spotted owl habitat selected by environmentalists and areas that are not spotted owl habitat but have been protected by the injunctions.

 A homemade bomb exploded outside a discotheque in northern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> early Thursday and wounded seven <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, four of them seriously, officials reported. Two other Americans in the group escaped injury. No one claimed responsibility for the fourth attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> since Feb. 1. `` Witnesses say the bomb was apparently thrown from a car, but the scenario is still confused,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. `` They do n't say if the bomb was thrown from a moving car or a parked car. We're still investigating.'' The soldiers had gone into <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceiba </PERSON>, a coastal town 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, in civilian dress and without proper leave, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` They were not authorized to go into town,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` The group was part of a convoy carrying equipment and machinery from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castilla </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> air base. I have no further details for the moment.'' Officials said the convoy of about 150 Americans was returning Wednesday from a road-building exercise with Honduran troops and stopped at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION> for the night. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castilla </LOCATION> is 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The four most seriously injured soldiers were flown to a military hospital in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the other three were being treated at <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, the embassy said. The names were withheld pending notification of relatives. Col. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the Honduran military commander at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, said by telephone the explosion occurred at the <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Discotheque </LOCATION>, and four Honduran suspects were being questioned. He would say nothing further about the suspects. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said the two uninjured soldiers were turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers from the <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION> base because `` they refused to talk and demanded a lawyer.'' The soldiers had been working in the <LOCATION> Valle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguan </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had facilities at the <ORGANIZATION> Soto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cano </ORGANIZATION> base in central <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for years, and about 1,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are assigned there on six-month rotating tours. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has been the scene of frequent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military exercises since 1982, in part as a political signal to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to the south. Many Hondurans resent the increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military role in the Central American nation, as well as the use of Honduran territory by U.S.-supported Contra rebels battling <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government. On April 11, assailants attacked a jeep convoy carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers outside <LOCATION> Olanchita </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>. One jeep was disabled, but nobody was injured. On Feb. 1, assailants fired at an American military convoy in northern <PERSON> Yoro </PERSON> province. No one was injured. On Feb. 18, three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and two Honduran passers-by were wounded when a bomb was detonated under a passing bus in <LOCATION> Comayagua </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Soto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cano </LOCATION>. A shadowy leftist group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Morazanista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for all three attacks this year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987. The group, formed in 1979 and named after <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Morazan </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from 1829 to 1832. It is believed to be part of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel, other violent incidents in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have raised fears of increased activity by left-wing guerrillas and right-wing death squads. Six people have been assassinated in the last three weeks, including a university professor shot to death Wednesday, a union leader and a student leader. On Jan. 25, former military chief Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was assassinated. He helped found the Nicaraguan rebel movement in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> while head of the military from 1982 to 1984.

<HEAD>Thrift Executives Sentenced in Illegal Political Contributions Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two former thrift executives were sentenced Thursday to six months in prison for their role in a scheme to use money from the thrift for illegal political contributions. The executives of <ORGANIZATION> Commodore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> were given five-year sentences by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, who suspended all but six months of the sentences. <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON>'s former owner, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in prison for creating the donation scheme, which began in 1982. A jury in May convicted the Hopkins brothers on 47 counts including conspiracy, making false entries into the records of a bank, misappropriation of funds and making false statements to a federal agency. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, former Commodore chief executive, was convicted on two counts of making false entries into the records of a bank, but acquitted on the other charges. Fish also ordered all three men to pay restitution to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for money diverted from the thrift. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will recover $ 104,062 from the judgment, with <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> to pay about $ 4,000 and the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> brothers to pay the balance. Federal law prohibits corporate contributions to political campaigns. During the trial, thrift employees testified they gave money to political action committees and were reimbursed through pay increases or checks for fictional travel. Prosecutors alleged the defendants tried to hide contributions to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who was then embroiled in an ethics investigation that led to his resignation. Prosecutors said there was no evidence that recipients of the contributions knew of the scheme. Attorney <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, who represented the defendants, did not return a phone call from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said the case was the first involving illegal political contributions to be tried at the felony level. The charge is a misdemeanor, but was upgraded because the defendants were accused of making false statements to a federal agency and entering false information in bank records.

 Young descendants of immigrants who crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in years past to work in the fields and factories of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as the nation sinks deep into recession. `` This is my home and I hope to return to it and live and die here, but not if it means starving to death because I do n't have any work,'' <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bignone </PERSON>, a 23-year-old auto mechanic, said as he stood outside the Spanish Consulate to apply for a visa. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Imas </PERSON>, a 30-year-old print shop employee, said his grandfather told him many times about the four-week trip he made from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` Now I'm hoping to find enough money to buy a one-way ticket on <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Imas </PERSON> said. `` The transportation has changed and the direction is reversed, but the idea is the same.'' As inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five months ago, businesses have closed by the score and thousands of workers have been laid off. Argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have watched in dismay as food, gasoline, cigarettes, movie tickets and virtually everything else have shot up in price, while wages in real terms have shrunk. Argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons. A decade ago, it was to escape the violence of left-wing subversion followed by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in March, 1976. For the past several years, Argentines have left in search of economic opportunity, however, and visa applications have accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months. With the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar, a teacher who earned $ 100 a month at the end of 1988 would have been earning a little as $ 40 at the end of June; a newspaper reporter who earned $ 300 now earns $ 90; a bilingual marketing administrator could well have seen his pay fall from $ 300 to $ 135 and a bank economist from $ 700 to $ 300. Some of those employers have taken their own measures to offset inflation. `` A lot of people are thinking that their children have limited futures,'' said the Canadian consul, <PERSON> Andree </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazinet </PERSON>. `` They get all these skills at the university and ca n't use them in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. We get some of our highest quality acceptances from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> received 188 applications for immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year, applications stood at 1,292. Only 275 were issued. The Argentine government issues no figures on the number or job skills of emigrants, but officials at variousd consulates said visa applications are way up, and usually it's the best educated and best trained who are taken. The longest lines are outside the consulates of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the countries to which a majority of Argentines trace their roots. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to children of people born in those countries who never renounced their citizenship. Those visas are coveted because they will allow Argentines to work thoughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> beginning in 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is unified into a single market. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987, the Consulate said, and inquiries for the nine-month period that ended in March skyrocketed to 16,330. It gave no figures on the number of visas to be granted. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fainstein </PERSON>, dean of the Latin American Rabbinic Seminary, estimated that 2,000 Jews left <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> last year for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There has been an increase ... because of the permanent instability and insecurity here,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued 1,450 to 1,500 immigrant visas to Argentines in the past few years, a consular officer said. The number of applications is not kept, but it clearly exceeds the number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months, the official added. Standing in line at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponti </PERSON> said he hopes to move to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to work in his uncle's clothing store. `` My family split in two after World War II,'' said <PERSON> Ponti </PERSON>, 27, who works on the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> subway. `` One part went to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, another part came here to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The American side of the family is doing very well.''

 <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> was faced with two of the toughest acts to follow, but he has managed by talent and sheer perseverance to bring <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> to life in a new, modernized style that could carry 007 into the 21st century. The 44-year-old Briton was here for the opening of `` Licence to Kill,'' 16th of the adventures -LRB- not counting two unofficial films -RRB- that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie history. Most critics have found <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> at ease in his second go-round as <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>; his first, `` The Living Daylights,'' was not written for him. He also seemed relaxed in an interview, as if he had come to grips with a classic role that might have overwhelmed him. He admitted having `` enormous pause'' when he first considered it. `` My concern was not about creating the character, which after all is my job,'' said <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>. `` If I do it well, then that's terrific If I fail, then that's also part of being an actor. `` The pause was over how to deal with it, how to bring an audience with you, away from its history and into its new present. Very clearly, before I took it on, I knew that everyone has an opinion about <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>; it's part of the cinema-going consciousness. `` Everyone has an opinion about the actors who have played Bond before. Half the world loved <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>; half the world loved <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. Their films existed in two very different styles. You know when you take it on you run the risk of having the whole world hate what you do. If that had happened, it would have been a major catastrophe. Fortunately it did n't,'' he said. `` What one must face today is that we've got something new, something different. ... This is a new style of Bond. It is n't a light-hearted, comedic, spoofing <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. It's not a technological extravaganza. I think it's back down to its origins, its basics, trying to capture the spirit of <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, and of the early movies. `` I loved ` Dr. No' and ` From <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> With Love'; they were very exciting adventure-thrillers. I watched the train sequence of <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> the other day. It's still tremendously exciting.'' Previewers noted that <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> seemed to be performing much of his own action, but he discounted any threat to his safety. `` I think the strenuous side of a Bond movie is the sheer amount of time to make one _ six months, which is a very, very long schedule,'' he said. `` You're on location so you work long hours. The crew works 15 hours a day; we go back, watch rushes, talk about tomorrow's work, so it's 18 hours a day.'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> had a thriving career before producer <PERSON> Cubby </PERSON> <PERSON> Broccoli </PERSON> chose him as the fourth <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazenby </PERSON> had a single shot in `` On Her Majesty's <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' 1969 -RRB-. He grew up in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> with non-professional parents. `` My grandfather and grandmother were in vaudeville-music halls,'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said, `` but my parents were not involved in the theater. It skipped a generation. `` I suppose I first became interested, just like most kids of my generation, by going to the Saturday morning pictures. You find yourself in a very exciting, rare, different world. An extraordinary coincidence: The first full-length feature film I saw was ` The Red Beret,' starring <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, a determined teen-ager who says he `` left home at 14 forever'' in hopes of becoming a world-class dancer, is coming home to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> Five years after he said good-bye to his mother in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he is back for a five-week, cross-country tour as the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dancer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, the official school for what many consider the world's most prestigious ballet company. In the intervening years, always without family and usually without money, young <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> worked and danced his way halfway around the world, being supported variously by the governments of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He's also found himself in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and along the way learned to speak Russian, Hungarian and Italian. It's been, in a literal sense, a long leap. `` It's kind of strange,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said in a backstage interview at suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Wolf Trap theater. `` I left home at 14 forever. Now I feel like a foreigner, coming back home.'' `` When I left, my mother said I'll miss you and love you, but I want you to have a better life than I have,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` I have no other family, we come from what you would call the lower end of the middle class, and she had to borrow money for my plane ticket.'' The first stop was <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as he traded his <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> love of surfing, swimming and baseball for a chance to dance. `` I still did n't know if I'd make it,'' he says now. It was n't easy, even years later when he was discovered by <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Golovkina </PERSON>, director of classical dance at the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choreographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a stern but loved master of the ballet. Now in her 70s, `` Madame Golovkina'' discovered <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> at a ballet competition in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on one of his brief stopovers in this country since moving away. `` She's been like a mother to me ever since, and worked to get me accepted to the <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>,'' the rigorous training school for <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> dancers, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. Already the recipient of an award from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the first American graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> scraped together some money, packed his bags and ent to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` There was no cultural exchange at that time,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` I was an exchange student without an exchange program and I spent every day going from one government ministry to another looking for support.'' `` I lived in a hotel, and on the last day when I ran out of money they called and said, `` You can stay,''' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> recalled, relief still clear in his voice. `` They do n't have any foreigners'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said of the academy, which was founded in 1773 and annually draws thousands of young Soviets hoping to be admitted as students. Although he has n't been formally admitted to the actual <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> hopes to win that honor during or shortly after the current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, the academy's first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit in 20 years. `` I'd be the very first American. They've given me so much. I'd like to stay for years and bring what I've learned over there back here.'' The tour will take <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> and company to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he will be able to see, and perform for, his mother. Other stops include <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> will dance with a troupe of other young, promising ballet stars, including 21-year-old <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Malakhov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanyenko </PERSON>, 23, both winners of gold medals at the recent 6th <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> International Ballet competition. Both young stars have high hopes for continuing improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations, noting changes Miss <PERSON> Stepanyenko </PERSON> says `` are being felt all over the world.'' `` It is a difficult process, but we have much hope,'' added <PERSON> Malakhov </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> also has hopes, `` and dreams.'' `` With glasnost, we've started something really important and I want to keep it going where I can. I've even danced for President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he was sitting only a few feet from me,'' he said. `` I have n't danced for my own president,'' he added. `` Yet.''

 Visitors this week found the fabled city partly good old <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paree </LOCATION> primping for a binge and partly a capital under arms, stunned by sudden occupation. Below the surface, frenzied officials faced last-minute crises. Organizers of the giant Friday night parade hired sharpshooters with tranquilizer guns in case the elephants decided to moonwalk down the Champs-Elysees with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M Marching Band. It was not immediately clear how fast a tranquilizer dart worked. Or what one did with an inert elephant in the middle of a parade. Authorities had planned a temporary ban of alcohol along the Champs Elysees, fearing rowdiness from crowds milling around with liquid components of their moveable feast. Faced with violent objection, however, they backed down. One columnist observed: `` Do they think anyone would have stormed the Bastille without wine?''

 Most Frenchmen left in town seemed to be wearing uniforms and sidearms, herding polyglot legions behind endless metal barriers that lent an ominous tone to bright blue, white and red bunting. There was plenty to see, and eat, while waiting for the world's biggest party to materialize as promised But getting there was decidedly not half the fun. Following signs to Tuileries 89, featuring a computer-art replica of a 1789 <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> street and an android variety show, two visitors were stopped by guards. `` You ca n't go in there,'' said one, `` It's closed for July 14 celebrations.'' But, the visitors said, that was why everyone was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` Look,'' the guard said, `` We got missiles, anti-missile missiles, fireworks. How do you expect us to let the public in here?'' The visitors eventually found the right way in.

 In the gardens outside, an aging, elegant lady followed her poodle in aimless circles. Each had a bewildered expression. `` Can you help me out of here?'' she asked a stranger, seeking guidance in a neighborhood she had inhabited for 40 years. `` This is insanity, a disgrace,'' she said, identifying herself only as <PERSON> Odette </PERSON>. `` You ca n't go anywhere. I have friends who got a pass that allows them to leave their house, but they have no pass to come home at night.'' She referred to draconian parking and driving regulations that have sealed the center of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Later, a taxi driver named <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> was asked if he would be working the long weekend. `` Are you crazy?'' he replied, smacking his left forearm in a French gesture depicting a rapid escape. `` I'm getting out of here.''

 For a privileged few, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has never been easier. The trick is a series of passes, invitations and credentials, the issuing of which would have thrown King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON>'s protocol staff into cold sweat. Cars move swiftly down freshly swept boulevards, ablaze in the color of hyacinths and roses and giant tricolors tied in bows, unless any of 33 visiting presidents or prime ministers happens by. Near the Grand Palais, police waved on two tourists who ambled peaceably across the broad road. Suddenly, an officer yelled: `` Move!'' The tourists leaped sideways just as roaring motorcycles and a stretch Peugeot flying a <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> flag careered around the corner at breakneck speed, missing them by inches. On the Rue du <LOCATION> Faubourg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Honore </LOCATION>, the elegant street on which the Elysee Palace is situated, police shoved Parisians back into their shops when several visitors' motorcades flashed past. `` I thought this was our city,'' one muttered. If conspicuous, the security was not necessarily effective. One journalist, testing it out, walked through a sealed-off area with a hunting rifle in a scabbard.

 All over town, people caught up on their rest wherever they could. At the Tuileries, a disheveled couple lay sprawled under a statue, an upended champagne bottle by their bare feet. They were in stark contrast to the dapper stone figure towering over them, <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON>, the 19th century premier who set <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on a `` civilizing mission'' to bring couth to a savage world. Souvenir shops did a brisk trade in revolutionary lingerie, funny hats and condoms imprinted with a guillotine. Overall, officials said, the festivities were expected to attract $ 160 million to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, but merchants were n't convinced. `` This is a T-shirt crowd,'' sniffed <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON>, a salesman in a downtown gallery where Italian jackets start at $ 600. `` These are not spenders, believe me.''

<TEXT>
 The newspapers held fascinating tidbits. One noted that security teams for visiting leaders had to negotiate the firearms they were allowed, based on a strict quid pro quo. The Japanese were not permitted any. When President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> attended Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, his security guard was stripped of weapons, as were all others. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reprinted an item from 100 years ago: `` The present week is being filled up to overflowing with official and social events.'' There was a state dinner for officers of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> garrison and a commemorative fete for <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmoulins </PERSON> `` of Revolutionary fame'' during which participants would wear horse chestnut leaves and tricolor cockades. July 14th `` will be celebrated in a way that it is hoped will surpass all past events of a similar kind that this gay capital has ever witnessed,'' it concluded. This year's organizers said the same thing, and they may be right. But 1879 festivities included a world's fair that left <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with the Eiffel Tower, a tough act to follow.

 Rustlers are having a field day in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s blueberry patches, raking up $ 1 million in purloined berries a year But the state is fighting back _ a new law gives police the ability to catch thieves blue-handed. Teams of blueberry thieves who scatter from pickup trucks can pick dozens of 24-pound boxes in a night, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Jasper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Son of Milbridge, which harvests wild blueberries on 7,000 acres. The industry, fearing continued thievery during this summer's harvest, turned to the Legislature this spring for help Lawmakers passed a berry bill that was signed into law by Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>. It is designed to give authorities the tools to track down the illegal pickers and end the black market _ make that blue market _ in berries. The law requires pickers to get written permission of landowners, and requires anyone who transports 25 pounds or more to get a numbered permit from the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blueberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Packers and shippers must also keep account of the blueberries they receive in lots of 25 pounds or more. Finally, the law authorizes police, sheriffs, forest rangers and game wardens to make inspections and arrests and investigate blueberry thefts. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> is one of the nation's leading producers of blueberries, and they are one of its largest cash crops. Blueberries are a $ 70 million a year industry in the state, according to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> of the blueberry commission. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said thefts are worst in seasons when the price is highest. He estimated the loss during the 1988 season at $ 1 million. Suspected thieves confronted by <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON> employees typically claim they took the berries from someone else's fields, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. Others spotted in the act make easy getaways on the dirt roads that wind through the hilly barrens. `` These people are doing it for money,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who added that organized thieves tend to go where the berries grow the best. `` It's a big business.'' While people in the industry say the law was a long time coming, some casual roadside pickers believe the state has gone too far. `` For heaven's sake, the most I would ever take is three or four quarts,'' said a woman who asked that her name not be used. `` They've roped off all of the good blueberry patches. I'm miffed. I'll just have to sneak in after dark.''

 Tropical storm <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was downgraded to a tropical depression Thursday as it moved across the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> with top winds of 35 mph, forecasters said.

 A top aide to former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wants immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony implicating <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> in the influence-peddling scandal at the agency, sources said Thursday. The sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has told congressional investigators she can testify that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered funding for specific projects under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. The program was briefly suspended after <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditors criticized the selection process and said a number of prominent Republicans had been able to steer millions of dollars to their clients. The sources said Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> demanded immunity from prosecution in exchange for answering questions from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating abuses at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight-year tenure as secretary. One source said she told the committee that she could testify that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> personally ordered funding for `` numerous'' projects. The source declined to be more specific. A congressional source said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee, was considering such a deal `` with an open mind'' but had not made a decision Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> earlier refused to testify, citing her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. She spent three years as <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, and has been described by former colleagues as wielding great influence <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told the subcommittee last month he had no direct role in funding decisions in the Section 8 or any other program. Since then, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> intervened on behalf of several associates, including a former law partner. Subcommittee members have told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who moved back to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to resume his law and business dealings, that they want to question him again. Word on the negotiations between congressional investigators and Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> came as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials more than doubled _ to $ 1.1 billion _ their estimate of the losses in one program suspended because of scandals plaguing the agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Friday's editions that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> hired attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> to head a program that three years earlier had losses estimated at nearly $ 240,000 because <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> made false statements working as a settlement attorney in real estate transactions. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to one count of making a false statement, and has been ordered to report in mid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence. However, a memorandum filed earlier this year in court by federal prosecutors said <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> made false statements in 18 separate real estate transactions from 1982 to 1984, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> was rehired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in February 1987 after talking with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, the assistant secretary for housing during the later part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also voted to launch its own investigation into <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> operations during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, joining the two House panels already scrutinizing allegations of mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at the multibillion-dollar agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee said one of its priorities would be a review of a co-insurance program under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the subject of a new audit that estimates losses at more than double the earlier $ 452 million figure. The $ 1.1 billion estimate was based on the audit and information compiled by <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> officials, according to a ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was aware of the estimate Tuesday when he gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a $ 2 billion `` ballpark'' figure as the cost of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> mismanagement during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, the official said. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s testimony would mark a dramatic turn in the investigation, which so far far has centered on influence-peddling on the Section 8 program, suspected abuses of the $ 5 billion co-insurance program and lax agency management that allowed private closing agents hired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to withhold millions of dollars owed the government. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who has suspended or canceled three programs and ordered internal reviews of virtually all the agency's housing programs, has vowed to clean up the department that he took over last winter. In other developments: _ Black, <LOCATION> Manafort </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consulting company linked to influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed far broader dealings on HUD-related work than had been described by one of its principal members in recent testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> testified before the employment and housing subcommittee last month that his company had lobbied <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for two clients. However, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> released a memo from <LOCATION> Manafort </LOCATION> saying that further review found the company had lobbied <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for several other clients. _ Rep <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Traxler </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommitee, said its decision not to provide new funding for the Section 8 program was n't irreversible, but that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needed assurances influence-peddling has been eliminated _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved and sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> the nomination of <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> II as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, a post that will have a key role in agency dealings with investigations by law enforcement agencies The co-insurance program under investigation was among those <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the largest private lender under the program, <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe has expanded to include a review of company ties with <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, the former assistant secretary for housing. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> oversaw the co-insurance program. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed documents seized by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION>'s offices likely included official correspondence with his office at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's nothing that would look suspect,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. `` There would be routine correspondence from time to time between my office and DRG.'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said he had n't been contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. An agency spokeswoman said she could neither confirm not deny that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s actions were a part of the DRG investigation

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is preparing to grant <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a temporary loan of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion to help bring an agreement with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks on debt restructuring to a close, according to published reports.

 The Soviet military would be willing to give up sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would too, a senior Soviet general is quoted as saying.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Smokers Need More Help Fighting Nicotine Than Just
Saying No</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Giving up cigarettes is more than just a matter of willpower and smokers need more help just saying no to nicotine once they try to quit, a federal health official said. Noting that `` nicotine is an addictive drug,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, chief of epidemiology in the federal Office of Smoking and Health in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said former smokers tend to relapse. `` It is no longer an issue of getting people to quit, but how to help people stay off cigarettes,'' he said. Although 17 million smokers attempt to quit each year, only 1.3 million succeed, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. And though 60 percent of smokers never light up after quitting, the rest do, he said. The first through fifth years after quitting is the period that needs most attention, he said Thursday. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, an Australian epidemiologist who was involved in his homeland's anti-smoking program, spoke at the start of a two-day conference of 130 health educators and practitioners who create, provide and finance services that help smokers quit. The sponsor of the national Conference on Smoking Cessation was the Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. About 50 million Americans smoke. Despite a decline in the popularity of smoking, it is estimated 40 million people still will be puffing away in the year 2000. `` Are there ways to get more people to use these programs? This issue needs to be treated more like a business,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON>, executive director of the smoking institute, said in an interview. `` It's a mass marketing problem. We're trying to help people examine this issue in a way it has n't been examined before,'' said <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> insurance commissioner and another conference speaker, said insurance companies need to be compelled to offer discounts for non-smokers and reimbursements for the cost of programs smokers use to give up tobacco. A national leader in pushing for such insurance coverage, <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> charged that the industry resists such efforts. `` The bottom line is that health insurance companies do n't want to have healthy citizens, because then they would make less money -LRB- from medical claims -RRB- ... What businessman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to be in favor of that?'' <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> said. He called on government regulators of health insurance to compel insurers to offer such coverage more widely. Later, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the health insurance industry dismissed <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>'s charges. `` The insurance industry stands second to no one in its efforts to reduce smoking,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. White, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said health insurers have helped establish programs to promote health through the workplace and large health insurers offer discounts for individual policy holders who do n't smoke. `` It is to everyone's financial interest to reduce smoking as much as possible,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, whose lobbying group represents 350 insurers.

The return on the investment also is attractive, he said. Parking fines are $ 5 to $ 10, and the new tickets would generate about $ 37,500, he said. Once the tickets run out, <PERSON> O'Loughlin </PERSON> said he'll tell officers to tow vehicles parked in tow zones. But car owners who do n't feed parking meters will get a free ride.

 The National Space Council, working on `` a major new space initiative,'' is focusing on an American return to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, establishing a permanent base and proceeding from there to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. But it will be expensive, warns Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., who was among a group of congressmen briefed Thursday on several options being considered by the council Any of the options, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, will require `` a substantial increase in resources available to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> _ it will require doubling the size of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget.'' The council, headed by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, favors the moon-Mars scenario over other courses being considered, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, but no final decision has been made. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, executive secretary of the space council, conducted the briefing. `` They basically outlined three options,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the ranking Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> space science subcommittee, said in an interview. `` One, for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to move ahead with a robotic program and gradually phase men out of the space program; another, to go back to the moon with the idea of establishing a permanent moon base and then going from there to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>; and third, to take us directly to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> after the turn of the century.'' The council is not expected to make a recommendation about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space future to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in time for inclusion in his speech next Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first landing on the moon. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is `` basically consulting with the people on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> who have something to say about authorizing space funds as an advance of <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> consideration of a major new space initiative.'' Attending the meeting in the White House complex were the chairmen and ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees and committees that handle the space program. The space agency has asked for $ 13 billion in the next fiscal year, but is likely to get far less than that from a budget-minded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I made the point that they basically were asking for us to find about 2 percent of the federal budget for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in the 1990s and into the next century,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` We were almost double that level in the 1960s _ this nation has shown it is capable of spending 3.6 percent of the budget for space activity if the program is truly visionary.'' The National Space Council was established by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a presidential advisory body. It includes the secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the White House chief of staff, the national security adviser, the president's science adviser, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator.

<HEAD>Government Closes Books on Audi `Sudden Acceleration' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is closing the books on its investigation of `` sudden acceleration'' in <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> automobiles by concluding that a series of recalls greatly reduced the incidents in the German-made car. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in a report released Thursday, reiterated its conclusion that most incidents in which cars suddenly lurched forward or backward at full speed were caused by drivers putting their feet on the wrong pedals. But the safety agency report also said recalls involving 1978 through 1986 models were necessary for safety of the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 and other models. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales plummeted after a major 1986 recall. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> recall campaigns to modify the accelerator and brake pedals on 1978 through 1983 models, install automatic shift-lock systems in all models, and correct idle speed control systems in 1984 through 1986 models `` appear to have resulted in a very substantial reduction of the number of sudden acceleration incidents and accidents,'' the report said. Further reductions are expected as more vehicles have the recall work completed and older cars which do not have the work done are scrapped, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Some drivers had complained the West German-made <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>, distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, would suddenly accelerate when it was shifted out of park into drive or reverse. In February, the traffic safety agency concluded after a year-long study that most such events in Audis and other cars are caused by drivers pushing the gas pedal when they think they were pushing the brake. But the safety agency said this does not mean drivers are always at fault and design flaws may be to blame. The report said the frequency of wrong-pedal incidents appears to increase because of the location and `` possibly the feel of the control pedals and by problems involving unexpectedly fast engine idle speed which could startle drivers at inopportune times.'' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> has had seven recalls since 1982. The major one in 1986 called back 250,000 of the 5000-series automobiles to install the automatic shift-lock which prevents the transmission from being put into forward or reverse without the brake pedal being depressed. The report said this recall campaign was `` an effective practical countermeasure'' and other recalls also were necessary. <PERSON> Hans-Jorg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugerland </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> president, said the report ends a `` grievous period'' for the company, which has long maintained that sudden acceleration was not caused by a mechanical problem. `` Now, at long last, that result is official and the case is closed,'' <PERSON> Hugerland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hugerland </PERSON> also said installation of the shift-lock device caused complaints of `` unintended acceleration, real or imagined'' to drop 90 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of Audis dropped from more than 200 a day before the 1986 recall to 60 a day for the 1989 models in the first five months of this year.

<HEAD>Mutant Proteins May Serve as AIDS Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery that experimental mutant proteins can stop the destructive multiplication of the AIDS virus may give scientists a new weapon in their search for drugs to tame the disease, scientists say. In reports in today's issue of the journal Cell, doctors said they crafted these proteins by tinkering with two genes of human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. While one of the researchers called the work `` a major step,'' others were more cautious, noting that any practical result of this work is probably years away. Some time in the distant future, however, doctors said these fake proteins could be the basis of a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In the work, scientists changed AIDS virus genes known as tat and rev. Both produce proteins that are essential for the virus to churn out new copies of itself inside the body. The scientists found that by slightly scrambling the genes, they can make them produce proteins that do n't work. But because the proteins look like the real thing, the AIDS virus is fooled into using them instead of its own natural proteins. As a result, virus replication is shut down. Dr. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> experimented with the tat gene, and Dr. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> worked with the rev gene. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said that unlike most proteins, the fake tat product can be taken in by cells. There it will `` jam up the virus control mechanism for viral replication.'' `` We are testing it out against the most virulent strains of AIDS virus, and we are very encouraged,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. `` It's a major step forward, as far as I'm concerned, in possible AIDS therapy.'' However, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a co-discoverer of both genes, cautioned, `` It's an interesting concept, but it's a long way from making a useful drug.'' The AIDS virus kills by slipping inside blood cells called T cells, subverting them to make new copies of the virus and then killing the cells. People eventually die largely because of the destruction of these blood cells, which are essential for fighting routine infections. The scientists' research suggests two possible ways to combat AIDS. One is to flood the bloodstream with fake viral proteins that will overwhelm the genuine product and short-circuit reproduction of the virus. The other, probably more difficult, approach is to implant the viral genes that make these bogus proteins into victims' bodies so they will produce their own anti-viral ammunition In the latter approach, scientists would implant mutant rev or tat genes into a patient's bone marrow tissue, which makes new blood cells. The new bone marrow would produce blood cells that carry the extra viral genes. When these cells got infected with the AIDS virus, they would not be killed. Instead, the added genes would make proteins that would keep the virus from reproducing and destroying the blood cells. `` You would end up with a population of T cells that are no longer sensitive to the HIV virus,'' said <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>. `` At that point, you will have reconstituted the person's immune system and they should be in great shape. `` The long-term promise of this technology is that it's a cure, not just a treatment.'' But <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> cautioned that this approach `` is a long, long way from reality,'' and no one even knows whether it will work. In the virus, the tat gene is a sort of supercharger, vastly speeding up its ability to make new copies of itself. Rev is an on-off switch. When rev is working, the virus will assemble the proteins it needs to make new copies. But when it's shut off, no new virus will be made.

<TEXT>
 Despite the execution of four former Cuban military officers on drug trafficking charges, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reluctant to accept an offer from President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> for a joint anti-smuggling campaign. `` You do n't automatically start negotiating cooperation until you have an indication the other side is really serious,'' deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Thursday, alleging that drug-related activities in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are continuing. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> spoke after a Cuban war hero and three colleagues were executed for shipping tons of drugs to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration did not have access to all the evidence in the case and therefore can not make a judgment about the executions. `` With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorous prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' he said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has suggested U.S.-Cuban cooperation to halt drug trafficking, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they believe its possible the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader has known all along about current and past use of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> territory for narcotics shipments. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the drug probe that led to Thursday's executions began in March after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities arrested two traffickers who said they used <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a transit point for smuggling cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Another reason for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> caution in responding to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s offer, officials said, is that they do n't want to create with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> the same kind of situation they have faced with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, they said, has cracked down from time to time on his adversaries in the drug-smuggling business, winning praise from the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> while allegedly engaging in aiding drug shipments himself. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since February 1988 for drug-related offenses. The cautious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand has been criticized by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION>. He has said the administration is squandering an opportunity to strike a blow against drug traffickers. But <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration has had information linking <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to narcotics smuggling since 1982 and had expressed its concerns since then. `` Three federal indictments implicating <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in drug trade have been handed down since 1982,'' he said. `` Two of the cases have disclosed detailed allegations of Cuban officials' complicity in the drug trade, which to the best of our knowledge have not been investigated by the Cuban government.'' Until the recent arrests, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> rejected allegations that any <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials were involved in drug trafficking, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>USDA Sees More Hogs Go to Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hog producers are cutting back on their breeding stock but are sending enough animals to market that 1989 pork output should be up from last year, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hog producers have experienced a steep drop in returns over the past year but have made only a modest cutback in hog numbers,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. On June 1, the number of hogs kept for breeding was 3 percent below a year ago, while market hogs _ those destined for slaughter _ were down only 1 percent. And the report said producers expect to have `` about the same number'' of sows farrow this summer and next fall as they did last year. Commercial output of pork for all of 1989 was estimated at 15.9 billion pounds, up 2 percent from last year and the most since 1980. Market prices of hogs going to slaughter are expected to average $ 40 to $ 43 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 43 in 1988. The all-cut retail price of pork may be around $ 1.80 per pound in 1989, down 3 to 5 cents per pound from last year's average, the report said. Beef production was projected at 22.8 billion pounds this year, down 3 percent from 1988 production. Last month the agency forecast a 2 percent reduction in beef output. Prices of Choice-grade steers are expected to average $ 71 to $ 74 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 70 in 1988. Feeder steers may average about the same as last year's $ 84 per hundredweight, the report said. `` The relatively high feeder cattle prices should provide an incentive for cow-calf producers to retain heifers to rebuild their -LRB- breeding -RRB- herds,'' the report said. As a result of smaller beef supplies, average retail prices were forecast to rise 10 to 15 cents per pound, on an all-cut average, from the 1988 level of $ 2.55 per pound. Relatively high returns are encouraging broiler producers to expand production by about 6 percent this year to 17.1 billion pounds, the report said. Last month's forecast was a 1989 increase of about 5 percent. Wholesale prices were forecast at 60 to 63 cents this year, up from an average of 56 cents in 1988. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> output is expected to increase about 4 percent this year after a 6 percent increase in 1988. The June forecast indicated a 3 percent increase. Wholesale turkey hen prices were indicated at 68 to 71 cents per pound, compared with 61 cents last year. Egg production may decline about 2 percent this year, following a slight drop in 1988, the report said. Prices paid to producers were forecast at 73 to 76 cents per dozen, up from 62 cents last year.

 When city people move to the suburbs, they sometimes are bothered by pesky flies from a nearby farm. And that could lead to bad feelings and even lawsuits, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've seen instances all over the country where urban encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for homeowners and agricultural producers,'' says <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bram </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Cities are sprawling into the countryside at the estimated rate of 900,000 to 1.5 million acres a year, he said Thursday in an agency report. And to newcomers flies and barnyard odors are not part of their idyllic country dream. Some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other barnyard breeding places to find targets. One kind _ the stable fly _ can migrate up to 135 miles. <PERSON> Bram </PERSON> is the national program leader for insects affecting humans at the agency's research facility in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. `` We have to learn how to increase non-chemical fly control and how to make the same chemicals we have work better,'' he said. `` It goes beyond relying on screen doors, sprays and swatters.'' Possible tactics include several non-chemical baits in traps to lure flies; natural predators such as wasps that prey flies while in their pupa stage of development; and natural organisms such as fungi and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> attack is directed at four main kinds of flies: _ Stable flies, which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood _ House flies, which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food, then suck up both enzymes and food _ Horn flies, which bother only livestock on pastures and rangeland _ Face flies, also pests of livestock, but an annoyance to homeowners in the fall Stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem species for homeowners, said <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an entomologist and research leader at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> laboratory, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the stable fly is estimated to cost $ 400 million annually in damage to cattle,'' he said. `` It's hard to put a dollar value on the damage caused by the house fly. But worldwide, this fly may rank in the top 10 insect problems because it can transmit a lot of diseases.''

 A plan to provide condoms to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> jail inmates to prevent the spread of AIDS has been postponed for fear health workers could be prosecuted for permitting sex among prisoners. `` We do n't want to put our health educators at risk of being arrested, even though some have said they are willing to go on the line,'' <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayon </PERSON>, an aide to city Public Health Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Werdegar </PERSON>, said Thursday. After two years of legal review, Sheriff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> approved a plan that would authorize distribution of condoms to inmates in three <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> jails. The proposal, which had been scheduled to take effect today, has been mired in legal uncertainty because engaging in sexual activity in jail is a felony in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Any person who permits it could be charged with aiding and abetting illegal sexual activity, authorities said. The city health commission is scheduled to review the program Tuesday, <PERSON> Hayon </PERSON> said. `` If the commission endorses it despite the legal ambiguities, we'll go for it,'' she said. In a letter to <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> earlier this week, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said anyone who distributes condoms would be `` at particular risk of liability.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said circumstances that would influence the chance of prosecution include the reasons for distribution, the number of condoms issued and evidence of sexual conduct. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> thinks it's impossible to issue a legal opinion covering all situations and suggested <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> seek a change in the law. Most of the nation's prison officials ban condoms, arguing that distribution would only encourage homosexual activity. But <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> issue condoms to inmates. <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> insisted the primary purpose of condom distribution was to allow inmates to `` become familiar with the product without engaging in sexual activity.'' `` It's like driver's education,'' he said. `` You teach people to drive in a simulator.'' But he acknowledged sexual activity occurs in jails and said inmates observed having sex would be booked and arrested. `` If it is going to happen, we would prefer it happened with a condom so disease is not spread,'' he said. Under the program, inmates would ask health educators for condoms, which would be distributed one at a time if deemed medically appropriate after an interview with the inmate, <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> said. Condom distribution would be recorded in inmates' confidential medical records, he added.

 One week after a Palestinian forced an Israeli bus off a cliff, the site of the attack and the assailant's demolished home have become grim shrines representing both sides of the Arab uprising Hundreds of Jews gathered for a memorial service Thursday on the steep cliff where the bus plunged 200 feet into a gorge. A tepee-shaped monument has been erected from stones, charred tires and twisted metal. Dozens of Israeli motorists stop on the <LOCATION> Jerusalem-Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> highway's shoulder to peer at the blackened mark where the bus went up in flames. They leave behind a daily offering of flowers and blue-and-white <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags to memorialize the attack that killed 14 people and injured 27. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the impoverished Nuseirat refugee camp has also become a shrine, one that honors <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, 23. Police and witnesses say <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> forced bus No. 405 off the road to avenge a friend who was shot by soldiers and paralyzed during the 19-month Palestinian uprising. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>'s home has been demolished by the army as punishment for the attack. But that has not erased his legend, inscribed in graffiti on the walls of the camp. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, who is hospitalized in a prison ward, is considered a martyr because even though he did not die, he was on a suicide mission. `` To the hero <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>, the killer of the Jews _ a salute of honor and glorification for the fighter <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>,'' said one slogan signed by <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, a militant Moslem group. `` Long live the hero <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON>, symbol of sacrifice and redemption,'' said another slogan, signed by the PLO-backed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising. At the Jewish memorial service, people gathered at the blackened spot where the bus burned, picking through twisted steel and burned blankets. `` They burned to death,'' an elderly woman cried out. Several hundred people gathered on a cliff overlooking the crash site and beneath a sign that read `` Enough Terror.'' A week earlier, helicopters rescuing the wounded had perched on that same cliff. `` This is the gate of heaven. From here the holy ones went up to heaven,'' said <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, whose brother died in the attack. Legislators and clergymen delivered brief speeches as victims' families wept quietly in the front row <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags fluttered in the breeze and youths lighted 14 torches for the victims. Transportation Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsav </PERSON> said the attack proved Israelis are fighting a war for their existence. `` This murder proves to everyone that there is no difference between terror and the intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arabic word for uprising. At least 560 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have died in the uprising that began against Israeli rule on Dec. 8, 1987, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON>, minister of religion from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The enlightened world, the civilized world, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, European countries did not sound a clear condemnation of this vile murder.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was angered by the failure of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to immediately label the attack a terrorist act. After protests, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it considered the attack terrorism. Earlier Thursday, the bus driver <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Elul </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he too had stopped on the roadside to reconstruct the moments when a Palestinian wrenched the wheel from him and forced the bus over the cliff. `` It helped me to go back over what happened to me in those few fateful moments. I remember the angle of the bus as it fell down,'' said <PERSON> Elul </PERSON>, who suffered head and neck injuries in the attack. In Nuseirat, a wall left standing amidst the rubble that was once <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>'s home is also sprayed with graffiti and slogans. Small posters bearing his picture are plastered around the camp, home to 30,000 Palestinian refugees. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nimaa </PERSON>, 25, told The AP after the attack: `` I think he is a hero and I am proud of what he did.'' She gave birth to a boy the day before the bus attack. `` He visited me Wednesday night in the hospital to congratulate me and when I asked him where my present is, he said it will be a big surprise,'' she said. `` I think he gave me the greatest present in history,'' <PERSON> Nimaa </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> asked her to name the boy <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON>, after his paralyzed friend.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is stepping in with everything but the money to clean up some of the worst-polluted military bases, nuclear weapons plants and nuclear laboratories run by the government. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it plans to add 52 sites to its National Priorities List, the so-called Superfund list of hazardous waste sites needing the most attention. Among the sites are well-known laboratories and weapons materials plants such as <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Military bases account for most of the 52. Estimates for cleaning up the radioactive and hazardous waste at all the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear facilities range from $ 80 billion to $ 150 billion. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said in a statement that many of the facilities `` are much larger and more complex than other Superfund sites, with wide varieties of hazardous and radioactive wastes.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, in its Superfund program, can undertake cleanup activities and try to recover the costs from the corporate and other polluters. When a federal agency gets on the list, it must come up with cleanup funds out of its budget. `` We have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these cleanups,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator in charge of the Superfund, when asked about the possible cost to taxpayers. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget request for fiscal 1990 contains $ 500 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to clean up its hazardous sites. Although little money may be needed during the beginning assessment period, which lasts up to two years, the costs rise once cleanup begins. Cleanup must begin within 15 months after a plan is approved. `` You will see -LRB- budget -RRB- demands ballooning in future years as remedies are selected and the cleanup process, the expensive part of the process, kicks in,'' said Cannon. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> intervention is nonetheless important, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. `` The thing about the proposal is that it sets in motion a process whereby the federal facility is required to reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for cleanup,'' he said. `` Once the site is listed it becomes a requirement of law that an interagency agreement be achieved, that a schedule be set, that an enforceable program be put in place.'' The proposed additions to the list are followed by a period of public comment, after which they become formal. The 52 sites announced Thursday are in 26 states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had the most sites _ 10 _ followed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, each with four. Of the 52 sites, 41 belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, nine to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, one to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. So far, 12 of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s 17 nuclear weapons facilities have been proposed for the list or put on it. The Superfund list has 1,224 hazardous waste sites, 889 of which are final and 335 are proposed. Federal sites account for 115 of that total, with 41 final and 74 proposed.

<TEXT>
 The seven leaders of the world's richest democracies will spend much of the weekend working in a cocoon of marble-covered concrete suspended more than 300 feet in the air. That is, if they do n't mistake the open-air elevator shafts or the tubular artworks adorning the site of the 15th economic summit for scaffolding left behind by the builders. Such is the design of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arche </ORGANIZATION>, a 35-story white marble structure that is one of the French capital's latest architectural outrages. Such is the location for the meetings that run from today through Sunday. In attendance will be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>. To imagine the structure, picture a giant white cardboard box standing on its side, with the top and bottom flaps folded in to form what looks like a deep, glassless window frame. The summit strategy sessions on Third World debt, the environment and aid for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be held in the rooftop slab that hangs over a cavernous hollow huge enough to hold the Notre Dame cathedral, including its spire. To reach the summit in the sky, the leaders will ride the bubble elevators that could easily be mistaken for construction staging. Should the statesmen suffer from vertigo, they can ascend to the meetings through a disorienting expanse of stone stairs that stretch 330 feet wide at the cube's base. The Arche is not quite finished, and its inauguration was accelerated to accommodate the prestigious summit. Wittingly or not, the planet's most influential statesmen will serve as the guinea pigs for the controversial new structure, which will eventually house the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and an array of private companies. Hosting the financial summit in a previously unoccupied building may ease some security chores and avoid disruption of the business activities likely to bustle at the Arche once its trapezoidal towers are replete with as many as 10,000 office workers. But christening the complex with such a high-profile event could also invite embarrassment or disaster. On the eve of the summit, electrical and plumbing problems disabled most of the high-rise's washrooms and elevators proved woefully inadequate for the 4,500 journalists headquartered in the cube. Plastic dropcloths and wooden walkways still obscured much of the courtyard. Walls still needed paint, and electricians worked hurriedly to test the elevators Thursday under the watchful eye of dogs trained to detect explosives. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> personally chose the design submitted by late Danish architect <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreckelsen </PERSON> in a 1983 international competition for the structure. The president deemed the cubic entry an effort `` to unite technical prowess with purity of form.'' But in emphasizing form over function, the developers have drawn fire for what many see as more of an oddity than an artistic endeavor. Erected at the western extreme of an imaginary axis extending from the Louvre through the Arc de Triomphe and along the Champs Elysees, the modernistic marble monument completes the La Defense cluster of contemporary office towers that many Parisians consider a wart at the western edge of their revered city. La Defense, a bluff beyond the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> and the Bois de Boulogne where the French held off German aggressors in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war, has raised eyebrows and hackles since the first ultramodern structures took shape in the architectural expressiveness of the 1960s.

<HEAD>House Votes Phone-Porn Ban, New Communications Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A House bill to levy $ 50 million in new and increased licensing fees on many communications businesses would also ban obscene dial-a-porn services and restrict access to indecent phone messages. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the package on Thursday while also voting to enact a new fairness doctrine that requires broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial public issues. The committee action was part of a drive to hold the federal budget deficit in fiscal 1990 to $ 110 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The committee attached the dial-a-porn and fairness doctrine measures to its budget reconciliation bill, which is designed to generate $ 50 million through: _ A 12.6 percent, across-the-board increase in licensing fees charged by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ New fees on 17 communications areas previously exempted from charges, including ham radio operators and satellite launching businesses _ Increases in <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> fines that have not been changed since 1934 <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the `` vast majority'' of the $ 50 million will come from new fees, with about a third of the money coming from private radio operations such a rural radio, national paging services, offshore radio and mobile and cellular phones. Minimum fees in nearly all cases will be $ 30, as opposed to $ 5 currently. The $ 70,000 for satellites is the maximum. Other fees include a $ 6,760 fee for a telephone company that requests an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> hearing. The dial-a-porn provision comes in response to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the $ 2 billion dial-a-porn business. The court said indecent speech was protected by the Constitution but obscene speech was not. The court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is patently offensive, prurient and has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the committee's action `` takes the ruling of the court and works with those constitutional restraints. It bans obscene speech ... and it regulates indecent speech.'' The bill requires telephone companies to block dial-a-porn calls to their customers' lines unless a customer formally asks to have access to the service. The dial-a-porn and licensing fee measures passed on voice votes. But the fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted 35-8 against an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, to strip the provision from the bill. <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> objected that the fairness doctrine, a set of guidelines that were in effect since the 1940s before they were repealed by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> repealed in 1987, was unnecessary, unconstitutional and made the bill `` veto bait'' at the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> committees both passed fairness doctrine bills in April. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he would veto a fairness doctrine law, and fairness doctrine proponents were not assured of enough votes to override a veto. Committee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who has made the fairness doctrine a top legislative priority this year, adopted the commonly used ploy of attaching a controversial measure to an important spending bill `` The committee feels it's doubtful President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto the entire reconciliation package over fairness,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 People in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> are bad about smoking but good about not drinking and driving, most Hawaiians buckle up and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> residents are n't a sedentary lot, a health survey shows. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> asked people in 32 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> about their exercise habits, their drinking, their driving and their efforts to ward off heart disease, breast cancer and the flu. The survey, taken in 1987 and released Thursday, is the latest of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveys _ an effort to find out what Americans do to ruin their health. The survey found a wide variety of health-related behavior from state-to-state. It also found variations in the use of precautions, such as cholesterol checks, mammograms and flu vaccinations. `` We've seen that risk-taking behavior varies a lot,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anda </PERSON>, a specialist in health risks with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. He cited several possible reasons for the differences. `` It could be socioeconomic factors. It could be that the quality of medical care may vary from state to state, or the availability, or access,'' he said. `` Prevention has not had the emphasis it needs in this country.'' In the survey, the widest variance in unhealthy behavior was the use of seat belts: 72 percent of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> surveyed reported that they did not usually wear seat belts, while just 7 percent of Hawaiians fell in that category. But most of the nation seems agreed on a distaste for exercise. In all but three states, more than half the respondents said they led `` sedentary'' lives _ not engaging in thrice-weekly exercise sessions of 20 minutes or more. A look at the surveys' other highs and lows: _ Smoking ranged from 32.3 percent in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to 15 percent in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> reported the fewest with sedentary lifestyles, 47.2 percent, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the most with 73.5 percent. _ `` Binge drinking'' -LRB- more than four drinks in one sitting in the last month -RRB- was reported by 29.4 percent in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and just 6.6 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. _ `` Heavier drinking'' -LRB- 60 or more drinks a month -RRB- ranged from 3.7 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to 10.3 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>; _ Drinking and driving, defined as getting behind the wheel after `` too much to drink,'' ranged from 8.3 percent in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to 1.3 percent in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. _ In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, 56.8 percent of those surveyed had had a cholesterol check, while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, it was just 29.3. _ In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, 57.5 percent of the women surveyed had had a mammogram, compared with 34.6 percent in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. _ And while 41.3 percent of those 65 and older in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> had gotten their flu shots for the year, just 24 percent of those in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> did the same.

<HEAD>House Deals Blow to Companies Cutting Alaskan Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s governor and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> representative say legislation to cancel sweetheart deals two companies have to cut timber in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> is a case of environmentalists going too far. The bill, approved Thursday by a 356-60 vote, would terminate 50-year contracts with the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Pacific-Ketchikan and the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pulp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese firm, in the southeastern Alaskan forest. Proponents claim the companies have abused their special relationship and stifled competition from other companies while getting trees at bargain-basement prices. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., called the timber contracts a `` raid on taxpayers. `` The federal government has spent $ 362 million on Tongass timber subsidies since 1982,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` But because the government has assessed the value of the trees at rates set in 1956, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has received only $ 3.9 million on its $ 362 million investment.'' The size of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> combined, the forest is treasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear and bald eagles and contains the largest spawning area for salmon. It's also one of two remaining sections of a rain forest that once extended northward from northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is considered an important protection against global warming. But Alaskan officials say the vote ignored the state's interests. `` Today's House action is an unfortunate case of congressmen from outside <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> voting on the livelihoods of Alaskans,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` Alaskans deserve better and I suspect we'll get it when this measure reaches the Senate.'' Republican Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s lone representative in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said the vote demonstrated the power of environmentalists who ignore the need of Alaskans to find jobs. He claims 6,000 jobs would be lost if the lumber companies go out of business. `` I'm terribly disappointed,'' he said. Proponents say competition would be enhanced, however. `` If we cancel these contracts, it does n't drive the timber industry out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrazek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, co-sponsor of the bill. `` It simply puts these companies on the same footing as other companies.'' Young, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, favor a version that would have called for renegotiation rather than cancellation of the timber contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But that version was rejected 269-144 on Thursday. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said if the bill is not changed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, it will be vetoed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has already said he would recommend a veto of legislation that called for termination of the contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., vowed nine years ago to end the 50-year contracts, is also trying to attach the bill to deficit-reducing legislation which staff members believe would have better chance of becoming law By repealing a $ 40 million annual appropriation that aided the lumber companies, the Tongass Timber Reform Act would save the federal government almost $ 200 million over five years, after subtracting added expenses the bill creates. The legislation also would designate 23 areas as wilderness, barring timber harvesting and development on 1.8 million acres; and ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams.

King, opera diva Leontyne Price and country singer <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the original decision was reconsidered because of the float's importance to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and Mississippians. `` We're celebrating around the office,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Frascogna </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> float committee. `` I've never seen anything change so fast in my life. We were dismayed at their earlier decision.'' Her organization, the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tournament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, will launch the float in the 1990 parade. The reversal ended a frantic search for an Elvis replacement.

The $ 102,500 float was already under construction in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the parade is held. The Presley estate's initial refusal outraged some Mississippians and sparked a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> radio station's letter-writing campaign intended to shame estate representatives into changing their minds.

 A Houston-area lawyer is barred from doing business with the federal government because he was slow in turning over some $ 1.5 million from sales of property owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have not kept any money,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who had worked as a private closing agent for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevier </PERSON>, in the department's <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> office, confirmed that `` practically all of the money has been recovered.'' The department, which estimates it has lost about $ 20 million from closing agents who sold <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> property and kept the money, sent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> a letter two weeks ago telling him he ca n't do any more work for the government. The ban applies to all agencies of the executive branch of government, the letter said. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> hired private contractors, including <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, to handle the paperwork for closing the sales of property the department took over through foreclosure. Once the sale is closed, the agents are to turn over the money to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by wire within a few days. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, acknowledged he had been late in giving the money to the department _ sometimes by months _ but said it was due to one paperwork problem or another. `` Whether it's ` late' or whether he did n't plan to do it, who knows?'' said <PERSON> Sevier </PERSON>. `` Anyway, it's been turned over to our inspector general and possibly to Justice -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- for action.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he did not profit by hanging onto the money because it had been kept in an account that did not bear interest. `` The only reason that there would be any delay would be because of the incorrect reporting of the taxes that we might receive from the tax people that we use here, or in-house missed communications over at the department, getting them signed in the right amount of time,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he was not surprised to be slapped with a ban on doing contract work for the government because of all the attention that has been focused on closing agents and other scandals at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. One former closing agent, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, has become the most widely known because of her nickname, `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> HUD </PERSON>,'' given because she said she used some of her stolen money to help buy houses and cars for the poor. In all, she admits stealing more than $ 5 million.

 Democratic leaders want to quickly outlaw flag burning without changing the Constitution but congressional conservatives are promising to fight any foot-dragging on their proposed constitutional amendment. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary constitutional law subcommittee, said Thursday legislation would probably reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' August recess to overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision But he said it probably would n't be the constitutional amendment supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the proposed amendment might be `` reckless'' in its current form because it does n't detail what would constitute desecration of the flag or shape the penalties. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and other key Democrats, including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del; propose regular legislation designed to meet the court's concerns But in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Republicans are insisting the amendment does n't get second-class treatment. And House Republicans say they can force their amendment out of committee if the panel tries to hold it up. Republicans and some Democratic conservatives say the constitutional amendment is the only way to ensure the court ruling is overturned. `` Even experts who do not favor a constitutional amendment approach say that a legislative approach would not work,'' House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., told <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' subcommittee on Thursday as congressional hearings on the flag issue began Rep. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called for passage of the amendment Without it, he said, `` people will be burning flags throughout the country on every holiday occasion'' drawing strong reactions, especially from veterans. `` People are going to get hurt,'' he said. While many liberals object entirely to a flag constitutional amendment as a threat to the Bill of Rights, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> told the panel he would support an amendment if a simple statute did n't work. But he said a statute could enacted far more quickly, since it does n't require ratification by the states <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who plans to begin hearings in his committee soon, decried those who were trying to take political advantage of the flag ruling. `` The easiest thing in the world to demagogue is the flag,'' said the former presidential candidate. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who appeared alongside <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, insisted it was not a partisan issue and he said those who feared weakening of free speech rights were wrong. `` I have more faith in the strength of the Constitution and in the common sense of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people than to believe that the First Amendment can be weakened by protecting the flag,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the push for a constitutional amendment was being driven by politics and not any `` threat to this nations values or security.'' `` We are engaged in a crude form of political one-upmanship -- a crass competition about who loves the flag more ... with a cold eye toward the next election,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House tax-writers want millions of people who deduct consumer interest to give up the writeoff a year earlier so bankers and corporate executives may keep a special tax benefit of their own. That unusual tradeoff has been written by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> into a bill designed to raise $ 5.3 billion in new revenue for deficit reduction during the budget year that begins Oct. 1. The committee also signaled Thursday that it is likely to recommend significant changes in the surtax that finances catastrophic health insurance for older Americans. Aides said there also is considerable sentiment to make some cut in the capital gains tax, although not necessarily as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended. But on a 25-11 vote, the committee rejected a plan by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, to tackle the catastrophic and capital gains issues together. His amendment would have delayed for one year the Medicare surtax on older Americans and used a lower capital gains tax to pay for the bulk of the insurance program. Committee aides said the panel is likely to make some change in the catastrophic insurance tax next week. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been flooded with mail from older Americans with higher incomes who now must pay a surtax of up to $ 800 this year for federal insurance against costs of catastrophic illness. It is far from certain, the aides added, that the capital gains tax will be cut. Many Democrats are opposed because the bulk of the benefit would go to high-income taxpayers. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration contends a capital gains tax cut, which affects profits from stocks and other assets, would raise money and thus could be used to reduce the deficit. Congressional economists insist it would lose money after the first year. By a voice vote, the panel eliminated from the deficit-reduction package an increase in taxes on snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco. The three products would have been taxed at $ 2.67 a pound; snuff now is taxed at 24 cents; pipe tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco at 8 cents. In place of those increases, the committee agreed to speed up collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds. The biggest single revenue-raiser, affecting corporations that use employee stock-ownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that lend to ESOPs, was scaled back. It was to finance part of that scaleback that the committee agreed to a quicker phase-out of the itemized deduction for consumer interest. Only 20 percent of interest on loans for automobiles, education and credit cards is deductible. Under present law, that is scheduled to drop next year to 10 percent. Under the committee's action, the interest deduction would die at the end of this year. About 24 million couples and individuals take a deduction for consumer interest. The committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected with ESOPs, under which workers are given shares of the companies where they are employed. Under the committee's action Thursday, a bank that lends money to finance an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> purchase of stock could continue avoiding tax on half the interest earned from such loans only if the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> owns 30 percent or more of the corporation. The same 30 percent test would be applied before a corporation could take a tax deduction for certain dividends paid on <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> stock. A second change would make the new rule effective on July 10. This change would allow dozens of corporations that are setting up ESOPs to qualify for treatment under the old rules.

 The Apollo 11 astronauts kick off a weeklong celebration Saturday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of man's landing on the moon, beginning at the site where their lunar rocket was designed. They will take part in ceremonies and parties at three <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> space centers and with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the nation's capital. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> left the first footprints on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969, while <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> circled overhead in the command ship. The three will start their anniversary trip Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where the giant <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket that propelled them to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> was designed and tested. There they will meet with rocket pioneers and attend a reception and an open house concert where the landing on the moon's Sea of Tranquillity will be re-created by actors on a stage. The astronauts will be at the Kennedy Space Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on Sunday, the launch's anniversary. Against a backdrop of an unused <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> 5, now a museum piece, they will make brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the launch commentary in the minutes before the Apollo 11 liftoff. The `` taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. EDT, precisely the time they left <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. After the ceremony the spacemen will ride in a motorcade that will travel 20 miles to <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where they will be honored at a luncheon. On Wednesday, they will be in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for an evening reception at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum. The next day, the anniversary of the moon landing, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> will be joined by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a ceremony on the Mall in front of the museum. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to unveil a long-term space plan that could include strong endorsement of a permanent space station and proposals for building a lunar research base and sending Americans to Mars early in the 21st century.

 Beer ads on television should be regulated so youngsters are not encouraged to drink, an advocacy group says, but the beer industry contends it's up to parents to keep an eye on their kids' viewing habits. The Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that in an informal survey it conducted, television ads for beer were more popular than any other type of commercial among teen-age boys. Forty percent of the high-school boys surveyed said one or more beer ads were their favorites. Of the girls surveyed, 12 percent listed beer and wine ads as their favorites. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based center, said the ads have an impact regardless of beer industry claims that they do n't target youngsters. `` Intentions aside, their advertising is sure reaching these kids, and that's really the issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't believe this particular survey reveals anything more than parental neglect. Other surveys have shown no correlation between advertising and increased consumption, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. The competition within the industry is for a market that has leveled off, he said. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said the survey showed that advertisements for fast foods and soft drinks as well as beer are popular with teen-agers. `` It's high time that society either restricted such ads or made sure that messages for a more healthful lifestyle reached kids,'' he said. Boys and girls agreed on what made an ad attractive, he said. Those characteristics were humor, rock music and the depiction of athletes or other sports activities. In fact, the single favorite ad among boys was for <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> cars and trucks, followed by Budweiser or Bud Light. The single favorite among girls was McDonald's, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> or Diet Pepsi. The students in the survey were questioned this spring at public and private high schools in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and rural <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the Washington-based center said. The 284 responding students listed a total of 1,026 `` favorite or most memorable'' ads. The students' average age was 15.7 years.

<HEAD>Overhaul of Immigration System Clears Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of a planned overhaul of the nation's immigration system, including a cap of 630,000 immigrants arriving each year, are predicting a strong chance of approval in the House. `` I'm very hopeful that we'll get legislation. It's early in the session,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said Thursday after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure, 81-17, and sent it to the House The bill was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000 in each of the next three years but was expanded to include room for 30,000 new arrivals annually before final passage. The ceiling represents 136,000 more visas than were issued last year. Critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all but the closest relatives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and permanent residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The House killed a similar measure in 1988, but sponsors are more hopeful about their chances this year. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and co-sponsor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said they have already received encouragement from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders `` We've never given them anything like this this early,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> expressed concerns about changes the bill underwent before passage, but said it was `` time to face the unfortunate but hideously cold reality that there are many more people who want to come here than there is room or intent to accommodate them.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> praised provisions that reserved 120,000 of the annual visas for individuals who do not have family ties in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but who would be likely to make significant contributions in business, sciences or other areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> added a provision that would allow entry to spouses and minor children of those who achieved legal status under the 1986 amnesty program for illegal aliens. The thrust of the bill does not relate to illegal aliens, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> attached a number of riders that focused on the politically volatile subject. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 78-21 to raise the ceiling by 30,000 visas annually after Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., recalled how his father fled czarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1911 and arrived in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` with no rubles in his pocket, he had to come steerage. Further efforts at expansion, however, were rejected. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did approve an amendment from Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., that would force the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to halt its practice of including illegal aliens in its official count Proponents were concerned that states with many aliens would get an unfair edge in congressional remaps following next year's census. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said that under the current system `` states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would gain a -LRB- congressional -RRB- seat at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s expense.'' Among those entering for reasons other than family ties, 54,000 visas annually are subject to a point system giving credit for those with special skills who do not have employers ready to sponsor them. The <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> deleted a provision that would provide extra points to individuals who speak English. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in vain to restore the point system but lawmakers rejected the idea, 56-43. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved, 358-44, and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> separate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet and Southeast Asian refugees. It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jews and evangelical Christians as well as certain categories of Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted without having to prove it in each individual case. That would aid them in obtaining standing as refugees. The measure is opposed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which contends it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain refugees and makes it more difficult to fairly administer the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refugee program.

<HEAD>Congress Expects Favorable Deficit Forecast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Next week's update of the projected federal deficit for fiscal 1990, once seen on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as ominous, is now viewed by lawmakers as a harmless exercise that may even make their budget work easier. Many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they believe the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is likely to forecast a deficit that falls below the $ 110 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law `` My best estimate is that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> will come in with a set of numbers indicating we'll easily achieve the $ 110 billion,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` I would not even be surprised if the assumptions would yield closer to $ 100 billion than $ 110 billion,'' he said. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, who consults regularly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials, said his comments were based on an `` informed guess.'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the deficit will probably be projected `` very close'' to earlier estimates that the Gramm-Rudman target would be honored `` I'm not expecting any big surprises,'' he said. Failure to meet the Gramm-Rudman ceiling can trigger automatic spending slashes in most domestic and defense federal programs. Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> and others on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said they expect <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> to concede that next year's economy is likely to be less robust than the agency projected in February. A worsening economy tends to increase interest rates the government pays to borrowers and diminish the revenues it collects, driving up the deficit. But the lawmakers said that could be more than compensated for by higher than anticipated revenue collections by the government, as well as some spending savings. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> indicated that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> could claim $ 10 billion more in revenue than was expected in February, $ 3 billion in savings from the way the savings and loan industry bailout is being handled, and perhaps $ 1 billion in savings from changes in defense spending. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials would n't comment on the forecast. In other budget action Thursday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> imposed <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> fees on amateur radio operators, nationwide paging services and other radio frequency users, raising an estimated $ 50 million The panel also wrote new restrictions on dial-a-porn companies, and voted to write the Fairness Doctrine into law. The doctrine, enforced by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> until 1987, requires broadcasters to grant equal time to all sides of issues. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> took credit for saving $ 187 million by renewing the government's flood-insurance program The program is to expire Sept. 30, which would leave about 2 million policyholders eligible to receive benefits but not required to pay premiums. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation moving the money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` off-budget,'' and changing the way the service pays health benefits to families of former employees, pensions and other retirement payments The package claims $ 2.9 billion in savings. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> extended a fee it charges for loans and retained restrictions on the loan portfolios it sells, claiming a savings of $ 665 million The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> took similar action that it said saved $ 697 million. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s deficit projections assume enactment of savings in the $ 1.17 trillion budget passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in May. Congressional committees are beginning work on the spending, revenue and savings bills needed to carry out the deficit reduction envisioned in the budget. The congressional budget planned a deficit of $ 105.4 billion in fiscal 1990. The spending plan reflected an agreement worked out in April between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders.

The executions, which were not reported in the national press, brought to 29 the number of people known to have been put to death for disrupting social order since the June 3-4 military assault on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in which at least 200 people were killed. Meanwhile, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today that the state <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has decided to take tough new measures to weed out publications it considers unsavory. It said publishers in recent years have `` flooded the book market with low grade and vulgar material which contain violent murders and obscene pornography which have corrupted people's souls.'' It added that books and periodicals to be investigated and removed from bookstalls include those with `` counterrevolutionary and bourgeois liberalization propaganda.'' The Chinese government has blamed the June violence on `` counterrevolutionary rebels'' trying to overthrow the socialist system and has detained or issued arrest warrants for dozens of students and intellectuals who led the pro-democracy movement. Books by scholars now on nationwide wanted lists have been banned, and <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> workers have raided private bookstalls to seize copies. The administration said any bookseller or publisher who violates the regulations will be fined at least five times the profit made. The <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> source said the two executed men, <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangcheng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiyuan </PERSON>, were charged with `` beating, smashing, looting and burning,'' a catchall of crimes that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> uses for rioting. Neither was a student, he said. The <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> riots of June 4-5 are believed to be the most violent that occurred outside the capital. Up to 30 people were killed as people battled police, and a half-block of the city was destroyed by fire. More than 100 people were later arrested. The source said <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> courts also gave another man a death sentence with a two-year reprieve and sentenced three others to life imprisonment, one for arson and two for `` hooliganism.'' The two-year stay of execution means the sentence is converted to life if the prisoner shows a proper attitude. The source said courts in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> the past week have sentenced 20 others to prison terms ranging from five years to life. In the first weeks following the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national media reported the arrests of more than 2,000 people who took part in protests The arrests still are believed to be going on, although the national press rarely reports them now. One exception was Thursday, when television news showed an office worker being given a 10-year prison term for spreading rumors during an interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The interview, in which <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that 20,000 people were killed by troops during their attack on Tiananmen Square, apparently was intercepted by <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was sending the unedited tape by satellite. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> TV broadcast the tape and demanded that people turn the man in. Two women reported <PERSON> Xiao </PERSON> to police and later received cash rewards. <ORGANIZATION> Xinjiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s westernmost province, also reported Thursday that 10 people had received prison terms ranging from one year to life for involvement in a May 19 riot in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Urumqi </LOCATION>. One man received life imprisonment for `` a serious case of beating, smashing and looting'' during the riot when, according to official accounts, 150 policemen and government officials were injured, 20 of them seriously, and 43 trucks were overturned. The <LOCATION> Urumqi </LOCATION> disturbances focused on protests over a Chinese-language book, `` Sexual Customs,'' which Moslems claimed insulted their religion. About half of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 15 million Moslems live in <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fighting the Rising Tide, Metzenbaum Opposes Flag Protection Amendment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Flag Burning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Against the sound of furious politicians from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on down calling for a constitutional amendment protecting Old Glory, Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> seeks silence. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Democrat is going out of his way to try to convince his colleagues to leave the Constitution alone. `` Compared to the events that have shaped the Constitution, the burning of the flag in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by an obscure protestor was a blip on the screen of history,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> told members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday. `` But we will magnify it a thousandfold if it stampedes us into eroding the majesty of the Constitution,'' he said. `` We must not turn this foolish offensive act into an historic event.'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> did n't seem to make any headway. The House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights remained focused on taking flag desecration off the list of protected forms of political dissent. The issue for the panel is n't whether to reverse a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, but how to go about it The political outcry came after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last month that the 1984 conviction of a man who burned a flag in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> protest was unconstitutional because his actions were covered by First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> acknowledged he's up against a `` political tidal wave,'' but said he felt obliged to wade in. `` I would hope the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have backbone and will not try to change the Bill of Rights,'' he said. Even with action scheduled on the other side of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on one of his pet projects, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> sat patiently in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing room, listening to more than an hour of speeches, analysis and dire predictions of the foul things that could happen without a strong flag protection measure. When he got his turn, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> stuck to his script, reading slowly and calmly as he urged restraint. He evoked images of the excessive government reaction to political protest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and told the panel it is `` the right to protest even when it is offensive that makes us different from the rest of the world.'' `` Is the political breast-beating on this issue based on a real concern about a threat to this nation's values or security? No,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> told the committee. `` We are engaged in a crude form of political one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves the flag more. `` During times of heated passions our national leaders should call forth the best in us _ the love of freedom that has made us the model for the world,'' he said. `` The flag dispute has instead reduced the political debate to shameful and crass demagoguery.'' If the forces behind the amendment drive were offended they did n't let on. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee and one of the loudest pro-amendment voices, complimented <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s testimony. `` You have taken an intellectually honest approach for one who is on the other side,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while share prices fell moderately. The dollar closed at 139.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close of 139.05 yen After opening higher at 139.60 yen, the dollar ranged from 139.35 to 139.68 yen.

Statistics to be released include the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for June and industrial production and retail sales figures. `` Amid a wait-and-see position prevailing in the market, the yen weakened as foreign banks adjusted their holdings'' by selling the yen to buy dollars, said <PERSON> Hirohisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yumoto </PERSON>, a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On the stock market, the market's main index declined, with many participants retreating to the sidelines because of uncertainties over Japanese politics centering on July 23 elections for half the seats of the 252-member upper house of parliament, dealers said. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is expected to suffer a defeat in the elections because of reaction against an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax imposed April 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> influence-peddling scandal, and sex scandals surrounding Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.

<HEAD>Air Force Says B-2 Ground Tests Successful</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The B-2 stealth bomber is ready to fly after successfully completing ground tests, and takeoff could come as early as Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says. The bat-winged aircraft sped down a desert runway Thursday, hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the tarmac, said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>, director of the B-2 program. `` We've completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first flight,'' <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said. `` The airplane is in good shape.'' The bomber, in development for more than a decade, has been subjected to extensive computer-simulated flights but has never actually lifted off a runway. It incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar energy, rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do. But although the bomber appears ready to fly, congressional opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the B-2 just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities. Congressmen warned <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier this week that they face a tough uphill fight with the B-2, which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history. `` Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the B-2 will become a museum piece,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> pleaded with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to `` nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the bomber is essential for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to `` penetrate improving Soviet air defenses.'' Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> urged lawmakers to try to overcome `` sticker shock'' at the $ 500 million to $ 750 million price for each plane and to restore $ 800 million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month. At <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42 in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> refused to be drawn into the political debate, telling reporters: `` I'm working on the airplane end of the thing _ and the airplane is doing just fine.'' <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said engineers from <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which designed and built the B-2, and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials would spend at least one day evaluating data gathered during Thursday's ground tests. `` We will have to see what the data tells us,'' the general said. `` We'll be working on a number of issues.'' Nevertheless, he made clear that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne. After maintaining for years that the B-2 did n't exist, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> invited the media and dignitaries to a coming-out ceremony last November. Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next two weeks. The Pentagon is proposing a $ 4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990 for the B-2. Manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, the plane will cost about $ 24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in fiscal 1992, according to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The department has invested about $ 22.4 billion in the plane so far.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to `` nickel and dime to death'' the B-2 stealth bomber. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s plea was the latest in a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offensive to try to convince skeptical lawmakers to overcome the `` sticker shock'' over the expensive radar-evading plane and look instead at its strategic value. `` It's time ... that we move this debate from the question of simple cost to one of strategic value,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. `` The B-2 ... is an essential addition to our strategic bomber force if we are to have confidence in our ability to penetrate improving Soviet air defenses in the late 1990s and beyond,'' he said. The defense secretary spoke as both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> moved toward showdowns on the plane's place in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for a $ 295.6 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met behind closed doors Thursday to write its own version of a defense budget, which was expected to be revealed today. Concerned about the price tag of $ 500 million to $ 1 billion for each plane _ making it the most expensive bomber in history _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel last month cut some $ 800 million from the B-2 budget. A prototype of the plane made its first taxi tests in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, earlier this week but has yet to make its maiden flight. The plane successfully completed final ground tests Thursday, taxiing at speeds up to 75 mph, in preparation for a maiden flight that could come as early as Saturday. Recent figures have indicated that $ 23 billion has been spent on the B-2 so far, much of it in secrecy, and there are estimates that it will cost an additional $ 50 billion through the late 1990s. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee he could not guarantee against cost increases but said most of the major technical and cost overrun problems of the past are under control. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel _ over the vehement objections of its chairman _ last month cut the administration's request for the B-2 from $ 4.7 billion to $ 3.9 billion while restoring $ 300 million for a vertical takeoff plane and the F-14D fighter jet that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> wanted to scuttle. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., and the committee's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, prepared an amendment Thursday attempting to restore some of B-2 money but acknowledged the plane is in trouble because of its cost With $ 23 billion already sunk into the B-2 _ including work on 11 planes for development and testing _ cutting its funds now amounts to `` eating our seed corn,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` You do have to make that choice,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> added, indicating bluntly that he would prefer an either-or decision to stop the plane entirely or proceed with it on the administration's schedule. `` What you should n't do is nickel and dime it to death,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Tremors Detected After Undersea Volcano Erupts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists detected new volcanic tremors and a weak earthquake in the area where an undersea volcano spewed water and smoke the previous night, and the government warned another eruption appeared imminent. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prediction </ORGANIZATION> said an eruption is `` highly likely to recur,'' not only at the same spot but possibly other locations. It said it was broadcasting emergency warnings and news on significant developments to local families. Most of the 200 residents in <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> who had left their seaside houses about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to spend the night in <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples and schools returned home today, but 43 schools closed amid the uncertainty, said <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuhashi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the resort city of 72,000 people. `` Although there is no immediate danger, we have eight places ready for evacuees just in case anything worse happens,'' he added. No injuries or damage have been reported from Thursday night's eruption, but 21 people suffered minor injuries Sunday when two earthquakes measuring 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit the area Since June 30, about 22,300 quakes, including 480 large enough to be felt by humans, have been recorded off <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> and parts of nearby <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said new volcanic tremors were measured at 2:47 a.m. today, lasting about 87 minutes, and at 11:42 a.m., lasting about three minutes. The volcano erupted about 330 feet undersea at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday, about 8,000 feet northeast of <LOCATION> Teishijima </LOCATION>, an uninhabited islet, the agency said. While water rose about 100 feet in the air, no dangerous waves hit the shore. Maritime Safety Agency officials passing nearby on a patrol boat told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> today they were `` extremely scared'' when they heard a noise that sounded as though a huge hammer had hit the bottom of the vessel, and something was pushing the boat from below. `` We still have not confirmed whether the eruption formed a new volcanic mountain under the ocean, but a new piece of ground might appear out of the ocean,'' said a Central Meteorological official. This morning, scores of dead fish and stones of volcanic origin were found scattered on the <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> shore, <PERSON> Mitsuhashi </PERSON> said. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Masajuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiokawa </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Eiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nonaka </PERSON> called today for measures to protect local residents. <PERSON> Daisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimozuru </PERSON>, chairman of the earthquake prediction committee, told a news conference Thursday night that recent quakes in the area probably have been caused by magma, or molten rock, under the ocean floor. Large magma movements can cause earthquakes, which often precede volcanic eruptions. The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island of Hokkaido, erupted several times.

 Adults who use youngsters as lookouts and couriers in the drug trade should be punished with stiff penalties, three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> lawmakers say. `` Drug dealers think they can exploit children because children are rarely imprisoned for any great length of time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, author of a bill targeting a phenomenon that experts say has surfaced in the last four years.

 An Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mission has arrived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for a third attempt to find a solution to the country's electoral crisis. `` We came here to get a clear view of the situation,'' <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> said late Thursday. The OAS mission arrived only hours after the opposition rejected the latest government proposal for a junta to take over on Sept. 1, the constitutional inauguration day. International observers say the opposition led by presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won the May 7 national elections by a 3-1 margin. The opposition wants its victory recognized. The government controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, annulled the election on May 10. In addition to having its victory recognized, the opposition wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign, something the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought since last year. `` We feel that our proposal for a three-way negotiation involving the government, the opposition and the military has been accepted,'' another member of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission, Ecuadoran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, said. `` The important thing is to clear up details for a negotiation.'' The mission is to meet with government officials and opposition leaders and then submit a report to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on July 19. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said last week that he has been disappointed with the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> efforts so far. The opposition had expected the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to put more pressure the government to enter negotiations that include <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a drug-trafficking dictator, has thrown its support behind the opposition by imposing economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which indicted him last year on drug-trafficking charges, is trying to set the stage to renege on the 1977 treaties that hand the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> while prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell for the third consecutive day. The dollar ended the week at 139.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's close of 139.05 yen. After opening higher at 139.60 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 139.35 and 139.68 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 70.36 points Thursday, shed another 56.39 points, or 0.16 percent, closing the week at 33,574.77. The index lost 45.25 points on Wednesday. <PERSON> Shinya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirota </PERSON>, a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, described the day's currency trading as `` very quiet'' because many market players were staying on the sidelines prior to the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later today. The statistics include the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for June and industrial production and retail sales figures, which are regarded as important indicators of the state of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. <PERSON> Hiromichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishikawa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese brokerage, said trading on the stock market also was very thin, with many participants also awaiting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 330 million shares, down from 550 million shares on Thursday. Contributing to the decline in the Nikkei index was investor concern over continuing political uncertainty in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ishikawa </PERSON> said. Political analysts predict the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will lose its majority in the 252-member House of Councillors, the upper house of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament, in elections July 23 because of public reaction to an unpopular new 3 percent consumption tax, the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bribery scandal, and a sex scandal surrounding Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.

<TEXT>
 The Mozambican government has approved a peace plan involving negotiations with the guerrillas to end the country's 12-year civil war, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official on African policy said. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, made the announcement Thursday at the <LOCATION> Zambian </LOCATION> president's safari lodge after meeting with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, ending a week-long tour of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, headed today to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s former colonial ruler. Briefing <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> at the president's lodge in eastern <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> had received the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling party to engage in `` a full-fledged peace process through negotiations over the conflict in his country. `` He has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be helpful and we have agreed to do whatever he thinks we should do to contribute to this process,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Earlier at <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> indicated he might ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet with the guerrillas, and that such a request would be seriously considered. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said he would be willing to meet `` in confidence'' with F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and designated to be the country's next president, before or after the South African parliamentary elections in September. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> would not become president until September, when he is virtually certain to succeed P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> has previously said he would be willing to meet de Klerk after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> granted independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, whose elections are not scheduled until November. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> did not give a reason for offering to move up a proposed meeting with <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, but he welcomed the meeting last week between <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the imprisoned leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has its exile headquarters in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said he would also encourage the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging intermittent guerrilla attacks in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1961, to talk to the South African government. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> for offering to meet <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> had talked to early this month. He said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was `` a man who is willing to listen to ideas. `` I believe it is important the he listen not only to the ideas of Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and -LRB- West German Chancellor -RRB- <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, but that he also talks to African leaders, because he is an African and has to find African solutions to the problems of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I am persuaded that the president truly seeks to resolve the conflict through a political settlement,'' he said. `` It is now important for <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym for the guerrilla organization -RRB- to reciprocate by accepting the principle that no group in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> should seek to impose its will on the people or government through use of force or violence,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> `` indicated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could play a role in facilitating the peace process. We agree to play a role and will continue discussions to decide how this can best be carried out,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official added. The national news agency AIM said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> made it clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' role would be on the side of the Mozambican government and `` not as a mediator.'' He said <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> `` indicated that he might ask us to meet RENAMO some time. If he does this, we will consider it seriously.'' <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> began its guerrilla war against the Marxist government in 1977, with <LOCATION> Rhodesian </LOCATION> help, and was then aided by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from 1980-84, until <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed a non-agression pact with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The Mozambican government continued to accuse <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of violating the agreement, but relations have improved recently and the Mozambican government now says support for the guerrillas still comes from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but it does not say who is behind it. <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been accused of mutilating peasants, enslaving children, burning villages and crops and attacking food relief convoys, is not openly supported by any government, but it maintains offices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Contra Aid Indictment on Grounds of War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six men accused of illegally aiding the Contras have been cleared of Neutrality Act violations by a federal judge who said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executive branch was conducting a secret war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the time. Defense attorneys on Thursday hailed the dismissal as proof of their contention that the indicted men were only carrying out <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies. The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil against a nation with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at peace. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> agreed with the defense that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration waged war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1984-85 despite congressional votes to cut off funds for the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels. `` The facts show that the Contras, funded in part by the executive branch, continued their attempt to overthrow the Sandinista government,'' <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> wrote. `` The mere fact that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to fund the Contra cause for a brief period of time is not equivalent to saying that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was ` at peace' with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He pointed to the conflicts in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> raids on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as evidence that war can be conducted without a formal declaration. `` It appears that declarations of war between nations have become passe,'' the judge said in his opinion released Thursday. During the hearings, defense witnesses testified that Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a presidential aide, was providing the Contras with $ 32 million at the same time the defendants were training anti-Sandinista mercenaries. North was convicted May 4 of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, altering and destroying classified <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a security fence _ in the Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced last week to two years' probation and a $ 150,000 fine The defendants in the Neutrality Act case also submitted volumes of the Tower Report on the Iran-Contra affair detailing how profits from the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were diverted to the Contras. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, who represents former mercenary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, hailed <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON>'s decision as a vindication of his client. `` This is the first time in the 10-year history of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that a federal judge has had the courage to declare what we all knew,'' <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said Thursday. `` This has consequences far beyond a mere district court in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office, said the prosecutors could not comment on a pending case. The judge's ruling completely cleared the four defendants accused of Neutrality Act violations _ <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, brother of top Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, head of the private Alabama-based mercenary group <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>; former stock broker and conservative fund-raiser <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and wealthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Maco </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, a former mercenary who soured on the war and provided much of the evidence used in the indictment, is named in two minor weapons counts unaffected by the ruling. <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>'s prosecution was `` vindictiveness'' by the government for his role in blowing the whistle on the Contra supply operation. Former Civilian Materiel Assistance activist <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> faces a passport violation. A seventh defendant, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, was included in the indictment when it was handed up last summer, but pleaded guilty to one Neutrality Act count, receiving a $ 50 fine and one day of probation. The seven men were accused of training mercenaries and launching operations against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil between October 1984 and March 1985. The indictment, filed a year ago, said they trained the mercenaries, armed them in some cases and led them against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, including one unsuccessful effort to blow up a bridge.

<TEXT>
 A judge has convicted a cocaine-addicted mother of delivering drugs to her two children through their umbilical cords at birth. Rejecting arguments that the law under which she was tried was meant only for criminals engaged in illegal drug deals, Circuit Judge O.H. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he viewed the two children born to <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarise </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as victims. `` These children had no ability to control what was being introduced into their bodies,'' <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> said in handing down the ruling Thursday after a non-jury trial. `` The defendant had that ability.'' The unmarried 23-year-old woman is believed to be the first mother in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ and one of only a few in the country _ convicted of pushing drugs to their children under a criminal drug-dealing statute. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> faces a 30-year sentence, but prosecutor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said he would recommend that she complete a drug program she is undergoing and then serve `` a lengthy probation period.'' In his ruling, the judge made two key determinations: _ That the illegal substance traveled from Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s body into the babies at birth, but before their umbilical cords were severed. _ And that `` a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has not been severed is a person'' within the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law under which she was tried. The defense had argued that a newborn is not a person until the cord is severed and that Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could not be tried under the law that makes it a felony for someone to `` deliver'' drugs to a minor. `` I am convinced and find that the term ` delivery' -LRB- in the law -RRB- includes the passage of cocaine or a derivative of it from the body of a mother into the body of her child through the umbilical cord after birth occurs,'' the judge held. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was acquitted of one count of child abuse. Other mothers giving birth to so-called cocaine babies have been successfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum of five years in prison. The defendant, who sat impassively during the trial, refused comment. Her attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON>, said he would appeal. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON>, representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and a doctor who testified on the defendant's behalf had argued that a guilty verdict encourage pregnant addicts to avoid prenatal care and give birth to their babies outside hospitals because they would fear imprisonment. `` I think what we found today is that having a baby is a crime for pregnant addicts,'' <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said. The judge said he believed the opposite to be true _ that pregnant addicts are now placed on notice that they have a responsibility to seek treatment. The children, a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January, are being cared for by Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s mother and an aunt. Doctors said they appear to be healthy.

<TEXT>
 Philosopher <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, a prolific writer whose 1943 work `` The Hero in History'' is still used as a college text, has died of congestive heart failure. He was 86. Hook, a leading figure in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intellectual circles since the late'20s, died at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. He had been a senior research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on War, Revolution and Peace on the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> campus since 1973. His major books include `` The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,'' published in 1927; `` Towards the Understanding of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>,'' 1933; `` From <PERSON> Hegel </PERSON> to Marx: Studies in the Intellectual Development of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>,'' 1936; and `` Common Sense and the Fifth Amendment,'' published in 1957. Hook's best-known work, `` The Hero in History,'' won the prestigious <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> Silver Medal of distinction in philosophy and education. Of all his writings, the one that received the most mail was an essay in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 called `` In Defense of Voluntary Euthanasia.'' `` I shall not be sorry to leave this world,'' <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> wrote. `` I've had a happy life I'm one of the lucky people who can live in their work, instead of after work.'' He wrote in his 1987 autobiography, `` Out of Step: An Unquiet Life in The 20th Century,'' that his key belief was that the central problem of the modern era is `` the defense and enrichment of a free and open society against totalitarianism.'' Hook founded in 1951 the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> and was an early critic of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who charged that communists had infiltrated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Hook expounded his views on issues of that era in two books, one titled, `` Heresy, Yes _ Conspiracy, No!'' He took the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> position in 1973 after he retired from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he had taught since 1927 and served as chairman of the philosophy department until 1968. Hook became a leading proponent of philosopher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s ideals, known as pragmatism, a peculiarly American philosophy that an idea must be judged by how it works `` The Metaphysics of Pragmatism,'' his first book, was an exposition of <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s thought. At the time of his death, <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> was planning a retrospective essay on <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, who died in 1952, that was intended for publication in the final volume of <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>'s `` Collected Works.''

 A teacher from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> was charged in connection with the Dec. 19 knife slaying of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educator, and police said today they were seeking a third teacher for questioning. Police said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Newberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was turned over to prosecutors today, a day after she was arrested and charged with destruction of evidence and concealment of a felony in the slaying of <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. Prosecutors must decide whether to deliver an indictment needed for a trial. If convicted, police said she could face up to 10 years in jail. Police officials, who declined to be named in keeping with official practice, said they also were seeking <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, for questioning in the mystifying murder case. Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, also a teacher, left <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in January and has not returned, police said.

The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Ms. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> told police she first learned of the slaying when Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, carrying blood-stained clothes, returned on the night of the death to the apartment the two shared. Prosecutors said Ms. <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> allegedly returned to the victim's apartment with Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> on the night of the murder and removed such items as a blood-stained camera and checks Violent crime is relatively uncommon in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, a city of 10 million people, and most foreign residents feel safer than they do in Western cities of comparable size.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group said today that it planned to test <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cherries and other agricultural imports to determine if they contain unsafe levels of pesticides or carcinogens. The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> said the tests would be conducted in overseas laboratories if South Korean labs either can not or will not cooperate. The first tests will be performed on imported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cherries to determine if they contain the chemical daminozide, or Alar, a suspected cancer-causing agent. Other imported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products also will be tested, said <PERSON> Song </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo-kyung </PERSON>, vice president of the alliance. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said today that recent concerns over food safety would result in more detailed testing of all imported food products. The ministry said laboratory testing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imported grapefruits and oranges showed they contained no Alar, but it said tests would be conducted on other agricultural products such as apple juice. The alliance recently led a nationwide boycott of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grapefruit after it said a government lab report indicated the presence of Alar on some fruit. Although the lab later clarified the report to say that its test did not find the chemical, consumers remained skeptical. The government lab declined to retest the grapefruit and an independent lab said it did not have the equipment. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s consumer movement against all chemicals in food production has grown. On Thursday, the Agriculture, <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced a ban on the sale and use of Alar on Korean farm products. Last year, an estimated 12,540 pounds of Alar was sold to South Korean farmers, the ministry said. Song said the concern is not restricted to Alar, which is used to enhance color and perserve storage life. `` The other issue is residues of pesticides and chemicals on all imported food commodities _ from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> or anywhere else.'' She said this included beef products as well as fruits and vegetables. Song said that Korean consumer groups depend heavily on consumer groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for research and information and the alliance coordinates with groups in other parts of the world. `` We are concerned about the safety of foods the consumers eat,'' she said. `` We are not concerned for the businessmen or trade issues.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has pushed <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to open its markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products to help correct <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s trade imbalance, which was $ 8.5 billion in 1988. South Korean farmers have staged protests against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products claiming they undercut domestic prices. The citizen's alliance is one of the largest and most outspoken of 10 leading consumer associations that claim a combined nationwide membership of 2 million.

<TEXT>
 An earthquake measuring 4.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale shook northeastern <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> today but there were no reports of injuries or damages, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency said the 8:52 a.m. quake was centered in <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southeast of the Yugoslav city of <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>. It shook an <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> area extending from the Macedonian towns of <LOCATION> Dabar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tetovo </LOCATION> to the Montenegrin capital of <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>. Quake-prone southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has experienced several small temblors in the past decade. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the quake lasted for about 20 seconds, longer than usual in the region. There was no immediate report on the quake from <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a semismograph. Authorities say a quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated areas, while one of magnitude 5 is capable of causing cause considerable damage in populated areas.

<HEAD>Taggarts' Net Worth Increased Ten-Fold While at PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> saw their net worth increase tenfold in the four years they were associated with the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, a bank officer testified in their tax-evasion trial. From 1984 through 1987, the Taggarts' combined net worth climbed from $ 171,000 to $ 1.7 million, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch manager <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said Thursday, citing personal financial statements she was provided by the Taggarts for an unsecured line of credit at the bank. The Taggarts are charged with evading $ 487,000 in federal income taxes from 1984 to 1987. Prosecutors say they diverted $ 1.1 million in ministry funds to their own use by using ministry credit cards and then using blank ministry checks to pay off the cards. On their 1983 statement, the Taggarts listed their net worth at $ 171,075, she testified. By 1987, their net worth was listed at $ 1,695,837, including $ 600,000 in jewelry and more than $ 350,000 in artwork. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 35, is an interior decorator. In late 1984 he decorated the hotel suite for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. His brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 32, was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s deputy from 1980 until spring 1987, when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in a sex and money scandal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> informed jurors that they would not have to return until Monday morning. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> also told the jury that the prosecution expected to rest its case Monday morning and that the defense would begin. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he expects to complete the government's case with two hours of testimony on Monday. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said he expects his case to last one to two weeks. Testimony by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is a `` real possibility,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faces trial next month on other charges growing from a 16-month federal investigation of the - bankrupt ministry Meanwhile on Thursday, a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> accountant testified he had difficulty getting the Taggarts to provide documentation for cash advances made to them by the ministry. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON>, a certified public accountant hired by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> at the time it was audited by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he helped draft a letter recommending <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> be fired if he did not hand over the documentation. <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON> testified that the action was necessary as the ministry prepared to appeal any sanctions by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, including revocation of its tax-exempt status. `` They needed to show that as soon as they found the problem, they took the appropriate steps,'' <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON>, who specializes in tax-exempt religious organizations, said he was never able to convince <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> to turn over any records. If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $ 1 million.

 Comparing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> for recent decisions on civil rights and affirmative action, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> called for a march on the nation's capital next month to protest the rulings. `` We're not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn us around any more than we'll let white robes turn us around,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said Thursday, referring to the garb traditionally worn by Klan members. Meanwhile, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> challenged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to offer blacks and other minorities more than `` kinder and gentler'' words. `` -LRB- Former President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> laid the tracks and built the engine to take the rights of workers and women and African-Americans and Hispanics and the poor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is putting grease on those tracks, not brakes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told 3,500 cheering people at the closing session of the group's 80th annual convention. `` We all appreciate President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appeal, a shift from hostility to be kinder and gentler. We appreciate that he is prepared to meet and greet us and even sup with us and even shake our hands. `` But after six months, it is time to look beyond the smile and look at the substance, because thousands of poor people, working people, women, African-Americans and Hispanics need more than kindness and gentleness,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who received the group's coveted Spingarn Medal for achievement by an American black The harsh criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> contrasted with the warm words Hooks had for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the week for his appointments and for inviting black leaders to the White House. In the term just ended, the high court struck down contract guarantees for minority firms, made it tougher to prove bias in the workplace while making it easier for white males to contest affirmative action, and allowed states to impose restrictions on abortions. The rulings `` have impacted on the civil rights laws already on the books. They have pinched them back so far that they have made them nearly null and void,'' said <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, the group's executive director. The nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, addressed this week by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cabinet members <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, decided to protest the administration's apparent inaction following the court rulings by calling for the Aug. 26 march, <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. The remarks by Hooks and former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued the attacking tone set earlier in the day by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` We hear new words from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigner and the first black to head the national party. `` In politics, as in poker, there's a phrase for it. `` I believe it's time that we tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, -LRB- national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and the rest of those Republicans it's time to put up or shut up.'' Several other speakers also attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, including former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is over at long last, but through the court, the music lingers on,'' she said. `` What we stand to lose is awesome.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said civil rights activists should turn to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for redress now that conservative Republicans she characterized as opposed to civil rights control the judiciary. After his speech to the convention Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters the president did not feel the court decisions needed to be overturned to advance civil rights. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and others said legislation should be introduced in the wake of the court rulings, which he said had shifted `` the burden of proof -LRB- of discrimination -RRB- onto the backs of the oppressed.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should introduce legislation clarifying the original intent and meaning of affirmative action,'' he said. `` And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should support it and agree not to veto it.''

<HEAD>Man Arrested For Flag Burning in Massachusetts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police arrested a man for torching Old Glory but charged him with destroying property rather than desecrating the flag because of the recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` Since we did n't know whether -LRB- flag desecration -RRB- was still punishable, we did n't want to endanger the case by using that charge,'' Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> of the police force in suburban <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> said Thursday. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved a resolution urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a constitutional amendment against flag burning, a move already endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar measure last month. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed by 47-0 a bill backed by Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> that would revise the state's flag desecration law, making it a misdemeanor to destroy or mutilate an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> flag except for disposal purposes. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the bill would not violate last month's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that flag burning is protected by the Constitution's freedom of speech guarantee The bill was modeled after a measure proposed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and, unlike the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law struck down by the high court, it does not refer to conduct that could seriously offend people. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed without objection an amendment to an anti-flag desecration bill that would extend criminal penalties for desecration to flags of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states and territories, in addition to Old Glory and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, police charged <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredyma </PERSON> of malicious destruction of property, a felony punishable by up to 2 -LCB- years in jail, rather than desecration of a national symbol. The key to the case is that <PERSON> Fredyma </PERSON> allegedly burned someone else's flag, not his own. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling `` does n't give you the right to take someone else's flag and burn it,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fredyma </PERSON> allegedly took down a 5-by-8-foot flag in front of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> Wednesday night, then set it on fire and ran it back up the flagpole. The 27-year-old man worked at the plant from January 1985 until last October and apparently was expressing anger at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fredyma </PERSON> pleaded innocent Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and the case was continued until Oct. 16. He declined to comment on the charge Thursday but said he was fired by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T after complaining about environmental hazards in the company's darkrooms, a claim the company denies. <PERSON> Fredyma </PERSON> also faces federal charges of using the mail to make physical threats against his former supervisors. According to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit filed in the case, he sent a June 1 letter to the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in which he accused top <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T officials of being `` traitors against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and its people'' and threatened to `` use deadly force against these traitors.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the company would not comment.

 Two lawmakers said they will seek to outlaw dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling, saying the barroom contests are demeaning and dangerous. `` It's just unbelievable that in this type of society we're going to start throwing people around,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spano </PERSON> said Thursday. `` There are enough prejudices out there against people who are different than others physically,'' <PERSON> Spano </PERSON> said. `` We are going to play to those types of prejudices if we allow this to happen.'' In Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a nightclub is facing state penalties for violating a restricted entertainment permit by holding a dwarf tossing contest, in which patrons competed to see how far they could throw a person. The state <ORGANIZATION> Liquor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it also cited the nightclub Carnival for two unrelated liquor violations. The bar could be fined up to $ 300 per violation and faces possible suspension or revocation of its liquor license, although revocation is unlikely, said <PERSON> Ronalee </PERSON> <PERSON> Polad </PERSON>, a duty officer with the commission's enforcement division. Club manager <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Vokoun </PERSON>, who was aware that commission investigators were present that night, said his attorney does not believe he violated his entertainment permit. The contest drew more than 300 spectators as well as 50 demonstrators, many of them disabled, who said the event was demeaning and cruel. State Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandstra </PERSON> has said he will introduce legislation later this year banning the event in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spano </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Velella </PERSON> said they will introduce legislation banning the practices when the Legislature returns to session in January. A ban on dwarf contests was passed earlier this year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after dwarf tossing became popular near the University of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

A spokesman for Decisions, a nightclub in <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, said it had one dwarf bowling contest to promote a special Australian night but wo n't do it again because of a bad reaction. `` I'd like to try and get it stopped because it's demeaning to a lot of little people,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Acquafredda </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a national group representing dwarfs. <PERSON> Acquafredda </PERSON> approached <PERSON> Spano </PERSON> seeking the ban. <PERSON> Acquafredda </PERSON> said bar owners take advantage of `` sick'' dwarfs who think they ca n't find other jobs. There's no insurance to cover any injuries they might suffer, he said. `` The people in bars who are doing it I think are disturbed and jerks,'' <PERSON> Acquafredda </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has announced it will make a new drug available to people with AIDS at no cost, although safety testing on the drug is not complete. <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>, or dideoxyinosine, appears to be effective but not dangerous like AZT, or azidothymidine, the only drug now licensed to treat AIDS. The New York-based company's decision Thursday was hailed as a victory by advocates who have sought to give AIDS patients access to experimental drugs. Supporters of <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had asked that it be made available because about half of all acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients can not take AZT. `` This is a historic development,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a leading AIDS activist who founded the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are grateful that pharmaceutical company has put compassion before greed.'' The Bristol-Myers announcement took government officials by surprise. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> had discussed making the drug available but had not expected Bristol-Myers to act so quickly, the Times and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. Under regular practice, a drug's safety is studied in Phase I tests and its effectiveness is determined during a larger, longer Phase II study. <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> has only been through the Phase I stage. It is still up to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to decide if Bristol-Myers can legally distribute the drug to people who are not part of the Phase II testing, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We want to do what we can to help,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Parret </PERSON>, a spokesman for Bristol-Myers. `` Any patient who does not meet the criteria for Phase II clinical trials but for whom <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION> is critical would receive the drug.'' The drug is expected to be distributed free of charge beginning in September when Phase II testing begins, the newspapers said.

 Legislators today questioned <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> about the workings of his secretive agency and laughed in disbelief at some of his answers, but they voted by a resounding majority to reappoint him. The most aggressive deputies were unimpressed with <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>'s responses to queries on phone taps, informers and dossiers But they relished the first opportunity in the nation's history for a public grilling of the boss of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, which killed millions of Soviet citizens during the reign of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and is still feared by many citizens. Only six members of the 542-person Supreme Soviet voted against the 65-year-old <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, who has been <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chairman since last year and was deputy chairman for 10 years before that. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>'s confirmation came despite derisive snorts of laughter from the hall when he claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> does not tap Soviet citizens' phones and complaints from several deputies about the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s network of informers. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said the agency, which performs both domestic and foreign security functions, `` strictly follows Soviet laws'' and has only a few `` helpers'' who inform on their neighbors and colleagues. Lawmaker <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>'s statements about informers were `` insincere'' and that in reality `` an army of many thousands constantly informs on what is happening in each work collective.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said there were agents in every Soviet institution. Yet during the 10 years he spent as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, `` They never caught a single spy.'' <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, a professor and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, also challenged <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>'s claims that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> employs few informants. She said many of her students have told her they were offered money within the past year to inform on their fellow students and teachers. `` It's a fact,'' she said. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> refused to reveal the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s budget despite repeated inquiries but said it would be published soon and `` You will be surprised when you see it.'' He also declined to reveal the number of <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> employees but did say the agency's border guard contingent alone numbers 200,000. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> does not maintain dossiers on any dissidents except those who present a real threat to the state.

<TEXT>
 Police captured a drug addict and ended a nearly 20-hour siege in which the man shot and wounded a police officer and exchanged his hostage for heroin, authorities said today. Police late Thursday night moved in on the man, a 30-year-old West German, shortly after he released the hostage, a 52-year-old woman, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON>, a police spokesman in this southern town. No one was injured during the operation in which concussion grenades were fired into the house. In exchange for the woman's freedom, police twice sent him a small supply of heroin and allowed his West German girlfriend to join him. The man was identified only as <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>, in line with <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> police practice. <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON> said that during negotiations with the suspect, it was determined that he was also responsible for the July 6 shooting death of 36-year-old <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendland </PERSON>, a West German taxi driver found in his taxi on a remote industrial site frequented by heroin addicts. <PERSON> Wendland </PERSON>, a resident of the Dutch village of Posterholt, was a cross-border commuter who drove for a West German taxi company, <PERSON> Naberhuis </PERSON> said. The motive for the killing was not known. Thursday's hostage situation began at 2:30 a.m. when the man broke into a house known to police for its connections with heroin trafficking. A woman living there alerted police, and the man fled into another nearby house where he seized his hostage. When police arrived, the suspect fired six times, wounding one officer. A 70-member police team, including sharpshooters and a specially trained arrest unit, surrounded the house and ended the standoff shortly after 10 p.m. <LOCATION> Heerlen </LOCATION>, located only a few miles from the West German border, is a major center of heroin trafficking and abuse by Dutch and West German addicts.

 A priest who served 3 -LCB- years in prison for harboring a policeman's killer has been found dead, the third Polish church leader to die in unusual circumstances in the last six months, state media said today. The body of the Rev. <PERSON> Sylwester </PERSON> <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was found early Wednesday at a bus stop in the Baltic town of <LOCATION> Krynica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morska </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. A preliminary post-mortem did not determine the cause of death, and another post-mortem was to be conducted, said <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajaczkowska </PERSON>. Unlike the other two priests, the 39-year-old <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was not known as an active supporter of the Polish opposition. In January, the Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON>, a pro-independence priest, was found dead of a broken neck in his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> rectory. The case is unsolved. In February, Rev. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>, a friend of the late Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, who was killed by security police in October 1984, was found dead after a fire in his home in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. An investigation concluded the fire was an accident. Ms. <PERSON> Zajaczkowska </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> had been vacationing at the parish of his former prison chaplain in <LOCATION> Braniewo </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Krynica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morska </LOCATION>, and disappeared Sunday. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was not dressed in clerical clothing and had no money or documents when he was found. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>'s former chaplain, identified only as Rev. <PERSON> Brandys </PERSON>, read a newspaper item about the discovery of an unidentified corpse and identified the body, said Ms. <PERSON> Zajaczkowska </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> hired a helicopter to fly to the town Thursday with a commission of church investigators. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was arrested in March 1982 and accused of helping two young men who had shot and killed a police officer several weeks earlier during a scuffle in a tram in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was sentenced to 3 -LCB- years in prison in September 1982 for harboring one of the killers. He was released in 1986.

 Health authorities have confirmed an outbreak of typhoid fever among visitors to a <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> resort town last month, with 13 cases identified and another 20 suspected. The victims include people who attended a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Pines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fallsburg </LOCATION>, about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Faith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schottenfeld </PERSON> said Thursday. In addition to several conventioneers, a hotel restaurant worker and two members of a senior citizens group that stayed at the hotel at the time have contracted the disease, <PERSON> Schottenfeld </PERSON> said. More than 10,000 New Yorkers attended the convention June 12 and 13. Thousands of other tourists who had stayed in the area are being questioned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schottenfeld </PERSON> said. The disease has been identified in residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> so far, she said. Visitors to the resort should be showing symptoms of typhoid fever by now if they have the disease, she added. The number of confirmed cases has grown since the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> first reported four cases on Tuesday. Typhoid is spread by eating or drinking food and water contaminated by people carrying the infection. The bacteria is shed in the feces of carriers. Symptoms usually appear one to three weeks after exposure and include fever, headache and diarrhea or constipation. Typhoid is easily treated with antibiotics and victims usually recover within a week.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Appeal Of Cooper Ruling Would Be Futile</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a case that generated international protest and plea for clemency from the pope, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set aside the death penalty for a teen-age killer. The court ruled 5-0 on Thursday that <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> should serve a 60-year prison sentence for the stabbing death of an elderly Bible teacher. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> committed the murder at age 15. The court cited a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision generally barring executions of killers who were under 16 at the time of the crime, as well as a 1987 change in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law that sets an identical minimum age. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law was passed after <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s crime and was not retroactive, but the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it would be unfair not to apply it to her. At the same time, the justices said, `` this is a difficult conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s acts. Attorney General <PERSON> Linley </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said the state had no grounds to appeal the ruling. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, now 19, pleaded guilty to the May 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, 78, of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> was stabbed 33 times with a butcher knife after <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and three friends went to her home on the pretext of taking Bible lessons, then stabbed and robbed the woman. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, an inmate at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Women's Prison in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, learned of the decision from prison superintendent <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trigg </PERSON>. `` It was a joyous occasion for her,'' <PERSON> Trigg </PERSON> said. `` She jumped up and down.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> must serve half of her 60-year term before she can apply for parole. While pursuing her appeal, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> gained wide support in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Roman Catholics and some European leftist groups adopted her as the symbol of their campaign against capital punishment. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> also entered the case on <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s behalf. In 1987, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> wrote to then-Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to ask for clemency for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. This March, when the state court heard <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s appeal, an Italian group called Non Uccidere, or Thou Shall Not Kill, presented a clemency petition with 1 million signatures to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherlin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> attorney who works for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> case `` really demonstrated how inappropriate the death penalty is as it is applied in this country.'' In an unusual step, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cited in footnotes to its opinion 11 news articles about the international protest and legislative maneuvering following <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s sentence. While sparing <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> from the electric chair, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the circumstances surrounding her crime `` clearly support the next most severe penalty under the statute, namely, the maximum sentence of imprisonment.''

 It is official policy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that the government and individual citizens have no dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But the idea there is no contact is also one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most enduring myths. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government has worked out various deals with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> over the years, most notably prisoner exchanges and a non-aggression pact in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1981. But even a hint in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of possible Israeli-PLO contacts raised a storm in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Hardly had Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> raised the issue before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday when denials were issued by spokesmen for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an absolute lie. We are not speaking directly or indirectly with that group,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s statement was the lead item on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television's evening news, with all the official denials On state-run <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio Thursday, there was an analysis of what <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had and had not said. It seemed more what he did n't say that raised the ruckus. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said, in answer to a question, that it would be an `` exaggeration'' to say there were official contacts between the two sides, but that there was `` classified reporting about contacts.'' He added he could only discuss the issue further in a closed session, suggesting there was secret evidence to support his claim. Amid the denials, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, an outspoken deputy to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, admitted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was having indirect contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> not only through the U.S.-PLO dialogue in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> but through other foreign channels. `` For 2 -LCB- months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been under way between the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government headed by <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, via the Americans,'' said <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, who is deputy finance minister. `` Whoever does n't admit this, whoever tries to ignore it is like a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the world does n't see him,'' <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON> said. It should come as no surprise. <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, defense editor of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in April after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to unveil his peace initiative that the trip marked the start of indirect negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> may insist that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but he and his Cabinet understand that from now on the Americans will shuttle between them and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> with proposals and counterproposals,'' <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began its dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> in January, after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a month earlier at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman have repeatedly said that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to ensure against even indirect contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, has instructed its embassies abroad to neither request nor receive information about U.S.-PLO meetings. But they have hastened to add they would listen to the views of Palestinians elicited by the Americans, without necessarily asking where they came from. At the same time, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have been meeting regularly with local Palestinians who are known supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, such as <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, to talk about <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections in the occupied territories. Over the years, similar elaborate arrangements have been made to achieve contacts between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In 1981, then-U.S. Special Envoy <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, shuttled between the two sides to work out a non-agression pact along the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> border. It fell apart when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> the next year, blaming the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for attacks on Israeli diplomats in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> carried out by radical Palestinian factions not linked to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Prisoner exchanges were worked out between the two sides in 1982, 1983 and 1985. One agreement allowed the evacuation of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his guerrilla force from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in August 1982. According to Israeli reports, an Israeli sniper had <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in his scope at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s port but never pulled the trigger. <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, the longtime <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activist, says he was given official permission by then-Defense Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, one of the most hard-line opponents of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, to see <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1982 to try to free a captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> airman. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said the family requested he go to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> agreed. He was unsuccessful, he said, because the government insisted on tough terms. `` Gen. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told me to get him out without giving anything,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. Later, he added, the airman was freed in a prisoner exchange. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who operates a pirate peace radio station offshore in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, says he has met <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> seven times the past 10 months in his quest for an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict. He is now facing charges of having contacts with a terrorist organization, which the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is under Israeli law. If convicted, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> can be sentenced to up to three years in jail.

The foster mother of <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> in October 1987 that the boy had been sexually abused, but <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> waited eight months before beginning his investigation, according to the indictment. By that time <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> was dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a breakdown of the body's immune system which leaves the victim fatally susceptible to viruses. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> was 9 when he died in November. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of failure to report child abuse. A 1977 state law requires child protection agencies to follow through on any suspected case of child abuse or neglect within 24 hours. Each count of obstruction of justice carries a maximum 10-year prison term. Each count of failure to report child abuse carries a maximum 6-month prison term and $ 500 fine. Social Services spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who has worked at the agency since 1973, said it was the first time in her memory that an employee has been indicted on criminal charges for failing to follow through on a suspected child abuse case. <PERSON> Edson </PERSON> declined to comment on the indictment, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. Calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to his home this morning were not immediately returned. State policy requires employees who have been indicted to be suspended or transferred to a less sensitive position until the criminal charges are resolved. No action had been taken Thursday on <PERSON> Edson </PERSON>. Now that <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> is dead, there is no way to prosecute the person responsible, so the investigation has turned toward the boy's caseworker, said <PERSON> Julaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, an assistant solicitor in <LOCATION> Conway </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Factory Utilization and Production Both Fell in June</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operating rate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories fell in June to 83.5 percent, while industrial production dropped 0.2 percent, the government said today, further easing concerns about inflation but providing more evidence of a slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the June operating rate declined 0.3 percentage point from May's 83.8 percent and April's 84.1 percent. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December. `` Declines were widespread throughout the industrial sector, with especially large drops for autos, mining and utilities,'' the central bank said. Economists had worried that the steady upward march of operating rates last year signaled increased inflationary pressures. The closer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures. Until recently, the central bank has been pushing up interest rates in an attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. In its other report today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said its industrial production index stood at 141.1 percent of its 1977 base, 3.4 percent higher than a year ago but down from May's 141.4 percent. It was the first decline since it fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been the first drop in a year. The pace of industrial production had risen 0.6 percent in April. Last month's factory operating rate of 83.5 percent was up from 83.0 percent a year earlier. The operating rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 83.8 percent at manufacturing plants, down from May's 84.1 percent. Prior to April, the rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods, big ticket items expected to last more than three years, fell 0.3 percentage point from 82.7 percent in May, reflecting in large part a reduction in the production of autos. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods dropped to 85.8 percent, comparied to May's 86.0 percent. Production, meanwhile, remained flat at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods. Output at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent following a revised 0.3 percent decline in May. The June output was 1.7 percent lower than a year ago and, analysts said, in part reflected the effects of a month-old wildcat strike by more than 30,000 coal miners in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Production at utilities dropped 1.3 percent in June, due in part to decreased use of air conditioning because of cooler-than-normal weather. Utility production had dropped 0.2 percent in May.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> set off fireworks of her own at the celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the French revolution, saying the overthrow of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> monarchy was by no means the founding of the concept of human rights. In an interview with the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> just prior to the summit, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the concept of human rights was enshrined far earlier than the revolution in the British <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carta </ORGANIZATION> of 1215 and in the American Declaration of Independence in 1776. The prime minister also mentioned `` our Glorious Revolution in 1688 when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> imposed its will on the monarchy.'' The response on both sides of the English Channel has been loud and angry with boos for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as she arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, criticism from French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and claims from one opposition British politician that she's `` gone mad.'' In a chilly interview to be screened on British television later today, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> reportedly attacks the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader by referring to the `` current trend toward social cruelty in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.'' On Thursday, scattered booes mingled with applause, greeted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> when she arrived for the bicentennial celebrations. `` Sounds just like home,'' quipped a senior <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the atmosphere between Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> during the festivities, the spokesman said simply, `` Very good.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has a strong lead over Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in domestic poll ratings, today accused her of making an `` eccentric spectacle'' of herself with her `` offensive'' comments about the French revolution. `` Such conduct is of course extremely offensive to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people who are taking part in an historic national celebration,'' Labor's foriegn affairs spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It is even more worrying for the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> people who are concerned for the serious problems this country faces after 10 years of Thatcherism and who now watch with incredulity as the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister makes an eccentric spectacle of herself in front of the world,'' added <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` I can only conclude that Mrs. <PERSON> Tahtcher </PERSON> sees herself as a 20th century <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> who, faced with the justified complaint of the electorate she misrule, airily replies: ` Let them eat pate'.'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said he wondered if Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> `` has gone mad. Her extraordinary behavior in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> indicates that she would do well to seek urgent psychiatric help.'' Headlines in the British press proclaimed `` Booing Greets <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> feud,'' and `` The Storming of <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> by Angry French,'' while the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> suggested that tempest has sent `` relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> plummeting to a new low.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s remarks underlined the long history of checkered relations between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, long time friends and rivals. In fact, the very conservative leader of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was not alone in her assessment. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a professor of modern history at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in today's <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> `` to her very great credit, has taken a robust and British view of the French revolution, telling <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> how much superior our own tradition is to all of the waffle, sentimentality and mayhem that July 14 really symbolizes.''

 Former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, whose loss in elections last month was blamed in part on an extramarital affair, wed former airline attendant <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> in a church ceremony as hundreds of supporters cheered outside. The wedding Thursday night had been put off twice because <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, fell ill. He was released from an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> hospital July 6 after two weeks of treatment for pneumonia and a kidney ailment. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s relationship with Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, 35, became public in September when she visited him at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hospital where he had undergone open heart surgery. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was married then to the former <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Chant </PERSON>, but he divorced his American-born wife of 38 years several days before the June 18 elections. His <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> lost the vote amid controversy over his personal life and a series of financial scandals. Conservative and communist opponents allied to form an interim government. About 50 people attended the Greek Orthodox ceremony at the church of <LOCATION> Panagia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eleftherotria </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Politia </LOCATION>. They included ranking members of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party, Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>'s relatives and journalists <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s four children did not attend. Upon arriving in a chauffeur-driven car, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> waved at hundreds of supporters who gathered at the entrance chanting `` Long live our Andreas!'' Minutes later, he walked into the church with Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, who was wearing a white strapless gown and a veil of white lace. The couple did not kiss as the priest declared them husband and wife. But as they drove off, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> obligingly leaned over for photographers and kissed Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> divorced her husband, <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapopoulos </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, after her relationship with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> became public.

 Unidentified gunmen killed one American nun and wounded another at their mission, a priest said today. Sister <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinkemeyer </PERSON> of the Franciscan Sisters of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> was shot and killed Wednesday night at the order's mission at <LOCATION> Wema </LOCATION> near the coastal town of <LOCATION> Malindi </LOCATION>, according to a priest at the <LOCATION> Garissa </LOCATION> diocese in eastern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The assailants also shot her American colleague, Sister <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterman </PERSON>, in the leg, said the priest, who would identify himself only as Father <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>. She was treated in <LOCATION> Malindi </LOCATION> and returned to the mission, he said. Father <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> said the diocese did not know how many gunmen staged the attack or what their motive was. He said the diocese's sketchy information about the shooting came from the Rev. <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeo </PERSON> who was visiting the mission from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. After leaving the mission, <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> telephoned the diocese about Sister <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>' slaying, but he passed out before completing the call, said Father <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>. It was not known whether <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> was injured in the shooting. A third nun, Sister <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Meurer </PERSON>, usually based at the Wema mission, was away at the time but has since returned, he said. Father <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> said Sister <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>' funeral will be held Monday at <LOCATION> Garissa </LOCATION>. The diocese and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> said the nuns' hometowns or ages were not immediately available `` It's very confused because this place is way up in the middle of nowhere, and there are no telephones'' at the mission, said an embassy spokeswoman. The Franciscan Sisters of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The mission in <LOCATION> Wema </LOCATION> has been in operation since 1948, and the sisters cater primarily to women and the area's health needs.

 Brass bands marched down the Champs-Elysees today and scores of planes streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of blue, white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of thousands of bicentennial revelers. Celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning at nearly a dozen places around <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to celebrate the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille prison. The thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics but for fraud, incest and lunacy, but the action marked the beginning of the French Revolution. The traditional Bastille Day military parade in the morning followed all-night partying that briefly got out of hand, resulting in a 5 a.m. scuffle between a few stragglers that riot police tried to clear from the Place de la Bastille. Three of the baton-wielding policemen were slightly injured as were an unknown number of others, the French news agency Agence France-Presse reported. About a dozen people were arrested. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> rode standing up in a jeep from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, where he took his place in the parade viewing stands behind bullet-proof glass shielding more than 30 world leaders in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Among those seated in the VIP stands to watch the military parade were President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Nine bands set the stirring pace for units representing every branch of the French military, including the Foreign Legion. Among the more than 100 planes that swooped over the avenue were nine Mirage 2000N's, designed to carry nuclear warheads. One squadron of aircraft trailed blue, white and red smoke, the French national colors. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> press center set up on the avenue estimated that 1 million people lined the parade route. But police sources said preliminary indications based on aerial photographs suggested a crowd of about 300,000. A meeting of leaders from the seven major industrialized nations was to begin this afternoon, coinciding with the festivities. The parade was the first of two scheduled today, the second of three days of bicentennial celebrations that began with a human rights ceremony Thursday and the inaugural performance at the new Bastille Opera. The concert was followed by street parties all over town. A parade tonight was to feature the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; M Marching Band. The biggest outdoor ball was at the Place de la Bastille, where the prison stood before it was burned down during the French Revolution. The enormous circular place was jammed with people of all ages. People perched on the base of the Bastille monument and the staircase of the new glass-and-steel Opera Bastille. Directly across, a huge white tent sheltered a stage where jazz musicians, African bands and accordion virtuosos played waltzes, marches, and other music to the staccato accompaniment of fireworks exploding in the balmy summer night. `` This beats any party back home,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who took a break from studying French in summer school to meet his friends at the Bastille. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> <PERSON> Driate </PERSON>, a computer technician from a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb, grabbed the hand of a surprised stranger with gray hair and spun her around to the music. `` I prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come here this year to be part of the most popular of French celebrations,'' he said. The smell of grilled sausages at sidewalk stands filled the air, and partygoers uncorked thousands of bottles of wine. The inaugural concert earlier at the new Opera Bastille, a high-tech hall built to bring culture to the masses, was attended by such celebrities as actress <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Deneuve </PERSON>, tennis player <PERSON> Yannick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> and Nobel Peace Prize-winning author <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisel </PERSON>. A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, opened and closed the 75-minute show. The <PERSON> Marseillaise </PERSON> was to be sung again tonight by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soprano <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> on the Place de la Concorde during a second parade that was to be the centerpiece of the capital's bicentennial events. On Saturday, a giant fireworks display across from the Eiffel Tower will illuminate the city and close the ceremonies. With the ouster of the monarchy and the promulgation of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, many believe the French Revolution shaped the principles of universal human rights and laid the foundation for modern democracy However, the revolt was followed by a wave of terror that eventually produced <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON> and his military dictatorship.

<TEXT>
 Jailed nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> wants permission to meet a wide range of anti-apartheid activists to coordinate strategies, a newspaper reported today. The anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> hopes to see several black trade union leaders when he meets with his family on Tuesday, his 71st birthday. Without citing sources, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has composed a list of up to 150 people he would like to see at Victor Verster Prison outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he lives alone in a suburban-style house. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> met July 5 with President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, fueling speculation that the black leader soon may be freed and that the government is seeking new means to break the country's political stalemate. `` The need -LRB- to meet with opposition leaders -RRB- has become pressing,'' The Weekly Mail said, adding that some anti-apartheid groups fear <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s isolation makes unified political action difficult. The newspaper said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> wanted to see <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Barayi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramaphosa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation. The <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment when asked if <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had made such a request or if he would be receiving visitors in the near future. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best known black leader and head of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, receives regular visits from his family and attorney, but talks with anti-apartheid leaders have been rare. He was imprisoned in 1962 under a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government. The anti-apartheid movement, which has many factions and numerous disagreements, has reacted to the <LOCATION> Botha-Mandela </LOCATION> meeting with conflicting statements. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, initially dismissed the talks at the president's official <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> residence as government propaganda involving no shift in policy. But the tone changed when <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> released a statement Wednesday indicating he welcomed his chance to talk with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. `` We do not condemn the meeting at all,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` For us to get to the negotiation table, we have to start somewhere.'' The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the meeting as a `` public relations exercise.'' It has not commented publicly on <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement Among issues that divide the groups is whether or not they should use violence to force change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In another development, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nation </LOCATION> newspaper said police raided Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home on the day her husband visited <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The newspaper said it did not know the reason for the raid on the house in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has mentioned no such incident and could not be reached for comment. Police said they had no immediate comment but would respond later.

<TEXT>
 The prominence given to the environment at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> economic summit reflects a growing view among world leaders that the battle against pollution is too immense and complicated for a single nation to tackle. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers are expected to argue forcefully that unless a resounding effort is made to enlist all countries, the moves to cut pollution by a few nations could be wiped out by actions taken _ or not taken _ elsewhere in the world. So leaders of the seven largest industrial nations _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ want to conclude their meeting Sunday with a unified voice that will carry weight among leaders not present. The summit participants are aware that the environment has become a hot political issue. Repeated polls indicate that people want their leaders to tackle the world's pollution problems. At the same time, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sees the environment as a way for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to extend a new form of leadership in the sometimes troubled Western alliance as well as becoming the conduit toward closer East-West ties in the coming years. `` Our shared heritage is the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during his stay in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` And the fate of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> transcends borders. It is not just an East-West issue.'' Dozens of international conferences have been held or are scheduled for the next few years to deal with global warming, the decay of the protective stratospheric ozone layer, dirty urban air, and oceans contaminated with everything from medical wastes to sprawling oil spills. All of these topics will be the focus of debate at the economic summit today through Sunday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The environment is coming on like `` a freight train'' as an international issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said. His chief environmental spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, complained recently that some of the conference participants may be trying to move too quickly. `` There is something of a race on by some of the economic summit participants ... to be the greenest of all on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, the first <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator ever to attend an economic summit. `` Restoring the environment is not a sprinter's game; it's going to require steady, long-term commitments. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, however, has been criticized by some environmentalists for being too slow in asserting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership on dealing with the growing global environmental mess. Earlier this year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dragged behind in calling for a ban on the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are blamed for depleting the ozone layer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> announced support for a ban only after European nations did. The administration also waited until the last minute before calling for an international workshop on global warming and then did so after critics charged the president was backing away from a campaign pledge to host such a conference. The workshop was to be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but now is planned for <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in October, although <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> insists the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will remain its `` host.'' The seven nations at the summit use about 60 percent of the world's ozone-depleting CFCs and account for about 40 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the principal culprit in global warming. `` You would n't launch a Marshall Plan at an economic summit,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> quipped to reporters recently while reviewing his expectations of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting, the 15th such summit and the first in which the environment has held this much attention.

 The four members of a special <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> unit who parachuted over the sinking wreckage of a single-engine plane routinely practice the sea rescue maneuver. They've never rehearsed a miracle, however. The team watched the powerless <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 spiral into the sea off the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> slumped unconscious in the pilot's seat. When they leaped from the HC-130 Hercules plane 3,000 feet above the crash site, they assumed they would recover a body. `` Then we saw there was a survivor,'' said Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. `` It was very special _ on the verge of being a miracle. In fact, it was right at miracle.'' Root, who passed out after taking off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 6:30 a.m. Thursday and flew for nearly four hours on autopilot, was awakened by the impact and managed to hang onto a raft dropped from the HC-130. Authorities said today that he had been shot in the abdomen at some point during the flight, and he was bleeding from the abdomen when rescued. He was listed in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear how the shooting occurred. `` I was slowly parachuting down then I heard from the plane that he was alive. My first reaction was that they either saw a body floating or they were mistaken,'' said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>. `` It's almost unreal.'' Around the country, nearly 82,000 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> personnel augment the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in crises and in peacetime. The unit from the <ORGANIZATION> 301st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homestead </ORGANIZATION> is one of three such teams trained to `` bring'em back alive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> in Robins, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The others are based near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, he said. `` They have to know how to pull them from the water, pluck them off a mountain if they have to,'' <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. `` They have to be in super condition.'' The three squads had more than 400 military and civilian rescues during the past 10 years, <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> said. The unit based in <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is credited with 142 rescues in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> said there are fewer than 10 sea-parachute rescue missions in any year around the world. `` We wait for years for one of these missions,'' said <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. `` For everything to go perfectly like this is just a great feeling.'' After Root was given first aid and oxygen aboard the raft, he was airlifted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> HH-3 helicopter to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, for initial treatment. The 36-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was then taken to <LOCATION> Opa-locka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jet. `` Looking back now, the whole scene was incredible,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. `` It's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''

<HEAD>Syrians, Christians Fight Fierce Duels As Tanker Unloads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fierce rocket and artillery duels occurred in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today after an oil tanker broke through a Syrian blockade and began unloading badly needed gasoline for the besieged Christians. Police said the barrage killed one person and and wounded seven. That raised the toll to 410 killed and 1,622 wounded since March 8 when the confrontation began between the 20,000 troops of the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000-strong force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Syrians opened up with 130mm howitzers and BM-21 rocket launchers, hitting east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s residential districts and a 28-mile coastal stretch to the north dotted with three major ports and small harbors. The Soviet-designed launchers fire 40 122mm rockets a minute. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners fired back with 155mm howitzers, targeting Syrian batteries along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s main boulevard. But several shells also crashed in residential districts, causing considerable damage. Radio stations interrupted programs to advise residents to stay in basements and underground shelters. News reporter <PERSON> Bahjat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> said that from his house he watched `` scores'' of rockets and shells fall along the beach at the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, `` The whole area is shaking,'' <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> said by telephone. `` They are shelling every docking facility, even fishermen's ports.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the Syrian target was a tanker carrying gasoline for 1 million Christians besieged in a 310-square-mile enclave. The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Lebanese gunners provided cover for the vessel to sail into port. `` The tanker has already dropped anchor,'' he said, refusing to say at which harbor for security reasons. He also would not give the tanker's name, the amount of gasoline it was carrying or its nationality. He said a Syrian gunboat intercepted the ship earlier today in Lebanese territorial waters, searched it for arms and allowed it to sail on. But soon after, Syrian gunners opened up. Syrian shells have struck at least six ships since the blockade was imposed March 12. The last victim was the Maltese-registered tanker Aloil, which sank off the enclave Sunday after unloading 880 tons of gasoline. The Aloil also had been searched by Syrian gunboats and allowed to sail on before it was shelled. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> began the siege in retaliation for a blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed on illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunboats intervened to tighten the siege two weeks ago after reports that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> obtained Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> demanded the medium-range missiles, capable of hitting <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, be removed from the enclave. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his aides have refused to confirm or deny acquisition of the missiles, which have a range of 45 miles. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are longtime rivals, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has declared support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' against Syrian troops deployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> lost their credibility after siding with the Moslems in the strife that has so far killed more than 150,000 people.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer today pleaded guilty to taking $ 475,000 in bribes from two defense contractors in return for providing confidential bid information about a computer maintenance contract. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 59, was among five people who entered guilty pleas today in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> admitted receiving $ 400,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and $ 75,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> between 1982 and 1984 while he was a branch head at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The two companies were competing for work on a computerized electronic maintenance system for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and is now living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, admitted that he received the payments that were funneled to an offshore company he had set up in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and later deposited in a Swiss bank account. Another former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, 52, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> admitted that in 1987 and 1988 he provided defense consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> with confidential bid information on a $ 20 million electronics contract. In return <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> had offered to pay him $ 1,000 a month, but prosecutors said they had no evidence that <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> ever received the money. The government has not charged <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, but according to court papers he was to try to sell the information he obtained from Manning to companies that were bidding on the contract. In addition, a former marketing manager for <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> and its successor, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to evade campaign financing laws governing political contributions to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> admitted that he participated in a scheme to conceal illegal political contributions that were made by defense consultants to the campaigns of Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and two other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members These people were then reimbursed by <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> for consulting contracts. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also admitted arranging donations to the campaigns of Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and former Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Badham </PERSON>, R-Calif., an <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who retired last year In addition, two consultants who worked for <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> pleaded guilty in connection with the scheme to pay illegal campaign contributions. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuba </PERSON>, 67, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and to three related charges. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarano </PERSON>, 74, admitted aiding and abetting the filing of a false statement in connection with a campaign contribution to the late Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. There was no indication that the congressmen named in the charges knew they were receiving illegal campaign donations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for Sept. 29. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> could receive up to 25 years in prison and fines totaling $ 130,000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy, receiving a bribe and tax evasion. All five defendants have agreed to cooperate with the continuing investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud, dubbed `` Operation Ill Wind'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> has returned more than $ 385,000 to the government. The guilty pleas came four months after former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and one of <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s associates, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, pleaded guilty. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>'s name first surfaced when <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> admitted that he had funneled $ 400,000 in bribes to the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official at <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s direction. Outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courthouse, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the broadening evidence of bribery of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials by defense contractors `` shows a disturbing pattern.

<HEAD>Walesa Will Support Any Communist Candidate for President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> announced today he will support any candidate from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> coalition for the new post of president and urged that the election be held right away. `` I state that I will cooperate with any president elected no matter if it is Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> or some other representative of the coalition, in order to solve Polish problems,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced June 30 he would not run, saying he was too closely linked with the martial law that he imposed in 1981 to crush the independent Solidarity trade union movement. He recommended <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, the interior minister, but the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership asked <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to consider running. In recent days, especially after appearing frequently with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his three-day visit, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has emerged again as a likely candidate. The Sejm, or parliament, will elect the president, who will be responsible for the armed forces and foreign alliances. The post was created after talks on political and economic reforms between the government and Solidarity. In his statement, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said for the first time that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s internal and international situation requires the president come from the communist coalition `` The president may be elected only from the party-government coalition. It results from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s internal and international situation,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` The election of the president should be held immediately,'' he said. `` Our country faces a great chance, but at the same time we have a constitutional crisis connected with a delay in filling the president's office. Extension of this situation causes additional dangers.'' <PERSON> Mikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON>, communist speaker of the Sejm, said Thursday he wants to hold the joint vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and the new freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to choose a president as soon as possible, preferably by July 22, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s national day. <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said in an interview that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit eased opposition to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s candidacy. But Solidarity members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, many of whom were jailed during martial law, have said they oppose <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. The Solidarity members have said they would take a stand on the presidency just prior to the vote. In the statement, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who is not in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said he does not instruct union-backed members how to vote.

The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned down two last-minute appeals to stop the execution. State Prison Commissioner <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> and prison Warden <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the jacks connecting electricity to the chair were reversed, and so did not deliver enough voltage to kill <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> on the first try. `` Through our procedures of checking the equipment each day, somehow, someway, it got reversed, and we are right now correcting the problem,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I regret very, very much what happened,'' <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said. `` It was human error. I just hope he was not conscious and did not suffer.'' <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, described <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' death as a `` grisly scene.'' When the guard raised the two vinyl shades covering the window in the witness room, <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> was already strapped in the electric chair, his face covered by a black veil attached to the hood of the electrodes on his head. <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said the first throw of the switch at 12:08 a.m. brought no visible response from the condemned man. A guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber, and told another guard directing the execution, `` I believe you've got the jacks on wrong. Neither guard was identified. Two doctors who examined <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> determined he was unconscious, but had a strong heartbeat, <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> told a news conference later. `` They're torturing him,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said softly to a fellow witness during the medical exam. At 12:17 a.m., the switch was thrown a second time. Ten minutes later, <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> was pronounced dead. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> law allows application of electricity to the condemned until the prisoner is dead. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' execution marked the second time in six years that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> prison officials were forced to use more than one surge of electricity to carry out a death sentence. In 1983, it took three jolts to execute <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a drifter who was put to death for killing a Mobile pawnbroker. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>, who according to court documents has an IQ of 69, was convicted in 1981 of murdering <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, a 26-year-old mother of four who was found stabbed 66 times and bound to a tree behind her home. A second defendant, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> became the 115th person executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the fifth in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to reinstate capital punishment in 1976. The nation's high court ruled two weeks ago that the death penalty is not unconstitutional when applied to the mentally retarded as long as the sentencing judge and jury consider the condition as a mitigating factor. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> was described as mildly retarded. As his last request, <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> asked to talk to Gov. Guy Hunt by telephone, but <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said the governor did not wish to speak to him. Hunt had denied clemency earlier Thursday, saying that he had reviewed <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' case but would not alter the decision by the courts. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> also refused to halt <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' execution. The condemned inmate had met with ministers on the eve of his execution. He also visited with his father, <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who later was among 13 who witnessed the execution. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, voting 7-2 each time, twice refused Thursday to block <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' execution. An initial request for a stay of execution had been sent to the high court, raising legal questions about executing an inmate of limited mental ability. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> voted to spare <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>. The victim's husband, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, had said that <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> deserved execution. `` It's taken so long,'' he said. `` It ought to be over.''

 <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s family and friends said farewell at a private funeral service today with the flowers and words of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s plays. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, considered the foremost actor of his generation, died Tuesday at age 82. Friends and family, including <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON>, and his four children, attended a private service in the countryside at the 12th-century <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, near <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s home south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who recently played <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> in a production at the Olivier Theater in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, read the lines from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s play: `` I have a journey, sir, shortly to go; `` My master calls me, I must not say no. `` The weight of this sad time we must obey; `` Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. `` The oldest hath borne most: we that are young `` Shall never see so much, nor live so long.''

The family asked that anyone wishing to mark Lord <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s memory make a donation to the Actors' Benevolent Fund or cancer research or `` that trees should be planted to enrich and restore the countryside. Atop the casket lay a floral crown from <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s family, made up of flowers and plants mentioned in the works of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> _ lavender, marjoram, marigolds, daisies, mint and daffodils. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s well-worn prayer book, a gift from his mother, was also atop the casket. Along the path were floral tributes from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and other less famous fans. One message read: `` In memory of the greatest actor in the world from two of his greatest fans.'' The card on Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s bouquet said only, `` Adieu.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today upheld the constitutionality of a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> pit bull ordinance that imposes severe restrictions on the dogs, but delayed enforcement for 30 days. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> ordered the grace period `` to give the dog owners who have not complied with the ordinance requiring registration pending my verdict an opportunity to comply with the ordinance.'' In three days of hearings this week, witnesses testified that only seven owners of pit bulls had registered a total of eight animals even though thousands are believed to be in the county.

Owners are required to register their dogs with <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in a 90-day period that ended today.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today struck down a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> law that keeps ethics complaints against public officials confidential, saying it violates the First Amendment rights of the person filing a complaint. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> issued a permanent injunction forbidding the state to enforce the rule against <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemma </PERSON>, who filed a complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> and then discussed it with reporters. State law and <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules forbid the person filing a complaint and the target of that complaint from discussing it in public until the commission reaches a decision on its merits. The commission argued the rule is needed to keep innocent public officials from being unfairly tarred by frivolous complaints. But <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> ruled that interest, while legitimate, was outweighed by the First Amendment's protection of free-speech rights. `` The question is ... not whether the state's concerns are legitimate, but whether they are compelling enough to silence a citizen-critic of official conduct through the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions,'' <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> wrote. `` <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedent makes it very clear that the answer to this question must be a resounding no.'' He added that it is `` a fundamental assumption of our system of governmful beams of atomic particles across space. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, said the experiment was conducted early Thursday morning at the White Sands Missile Range in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's the first time a neutral particle beam was fired or operated in space,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. `` Basically, it's to see whether a neutral particle beam would behave in space as we had theorized.'' The spokesman said it was `` presumptive'' to announce whether the test had been a success, since SDI officials and scientists needed to study the results of the experiment. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said SDI officials planned to release more information about the experiment on Monday. The test involved technology that will be used by the SDI program in its later phases. The experiment involved the lifting into space _ just for a few minutes _ of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator was to be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and how the particle beams moved. The total flight was to last only about 15 minutes. In June, a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to ignite on command. The Star Wars program is a research effort aimed at developing lasers, beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or its allies. The Defense and Energy departments are spending $ 4 billion on such research this year.

 Abortion opponents, labeled `` idiots'' and `` Bozos'' by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, picketed outside <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters today and called for air time to present their views. About 10 protesters marched outside Turner's CNN Center in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, watched by three policemen. One carried a sign that said, `` I'm no Bozo.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyert </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, said the group objected to <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s name-calling and to a pro-choice documentary planned for broadcast on SuperStation TBS July 20. Abortion foes want equal time on the cable TV station to show `` Eclipse of Reason,'' a film showing the results of a 24-week abortion, she said. `` We're disappointed with the biased programming,'' she said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who put his outspoken manner on the back burner the past few years as his business dealings became more time consuming, showed he has n't lost his flair for controversy when he made the remarks about abortion foes in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Wednesday. In a speech, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> would present `` Abortion for Survival,'' a program that takes a pro-choice slant in line with his own views. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said a televised debate on the issue is scheduled to follow the program. `` We'll give the other Bozos a chance to talk back,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` They look like idiots anyway.'' The debate panel will include Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood; and <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, president of March for Life An aide to <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, an abortion foe, said Thursday the congressman was not personally offended by <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s remarks and still planned to participate in the debate. `` He's still scheduled,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said speaking from <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, office. `` He's known <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> a long time He's not taking it personally. `` He knows -LRB- Turner -RRB- is just speaking rhetorically. It's part of the rhetoric that comes with the issue.'' Though Turner's remarks were reported across the country, even making the front page of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters reported receiving only moderate response. <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kitsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggall </PERSON> said about 20 telephone calls were received, half of them objecting to <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s comments or the premise of the program. Ms. <PERSON> Riggall </PERSON> said controversial programming has on occasion prompted hundreds of telephone calls. `` Believe me, this is not overwhelming,'' she said. Turner in the past acquired the nickname `` Captain Outrageous'' for his outspokenness, though he has been notably mellow in the past few years as the size of his media empire has grown and consumed more of his time.

 Former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, who served during the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms, was detained for five hours today while on his way to give a lecture on the 1968 reform movement, sources said. Sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, who requested anonymity, said police in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> detained <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> at the Hotel Olympic. The sources said a West German group was holding a seminar on Czechoslovak history at the hotel. An emigre source in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said earlier today that <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> was picked up with a West German citizen, but the sources in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and a West German who witnessed the detention said <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> was alone. The sources said the seminar, where <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> was to speak about the short-lived <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring liberalization period, was banned by authorities but that no one else was detained. The West German Foreign Minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> this week and met Thursday with <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>. In talks with top Czechoslovak officials, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> reportedly stressed the `` special importance'' of human rights in boosting East-West relations. The sources said the detention prevented <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> from attending a reception at the French Embassy marking the bicentennial of the French Revolution. <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> was released at 2:15 p.m. and taken home in a police car, but by then it was too late for the reception. <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, 76, who served as foreign minister during the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reform period that was crushed by Soviet troops, had his passport confiscated July 4 after he returned from a Scandinavian trip. Sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said he was told the measure was taken because of interviews he gave Western media while he was abroad and because he attended a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> June 20-22. During the interviews, <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> accused the Czechoslovak regime of being slow to implement reforms. <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> is a member of Charter 77, the Soviet bloc's oldest, unofficial human rights organization. It was formed in January 1977 and named for the document issued by founding members calling on <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to respect civil liberties. Its members are often detained by authorities.

 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose administration has been dogged by scandal, will run for a fourth term and does not expect <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to oppose him, a spokesman said today. `` The mayor definitely intends to seek re-election,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said `` I think he generally feels that he would like to run one more term to complete some of the projects that he started.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had said through aides he would consider running for mayor only if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> stepped down, said in a newspaper interview he has `` no plans'' to seek the post. `` I'll be doing more and more work out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the cause of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has plans to move to the nation's capital by the end of the summer, said it makes more sense to have a house than to stay in hotels. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s decision to seek a new term comes after months of speculation about his plans, particularly in view of a string of high-level resignations, the conviction of several former aides on criminal charges and the mayor's friendship with a man convicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> who is awaiting trial on additional charges in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> aides it did not identify as saying that letting word out that the mayor would run was an attempt to force <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> out of contention. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has indicated previously he would announce his candidacy officially in the fall. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, `` I have no comment. I do n't know the context in which -LRB- the Barry statement -RRB- was made.'' But <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> feels <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` will keep his word, which was that he would never run against the mayor.'' `` We expect <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to actively campaign for the mayor's re-election,'' another <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonds </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, pointing to <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s early support for both of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaigns <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> have discussed the mayor's candidacy. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s recent problems have prompted some business and community leaders to urge him to step aside after three terms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has weathered a series of personal and political crises since becoming mayor in 1979. Several of his top aides, including two former deputy mayors, have been convicted of crimes they committed while in office. Most recently, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was reported to have visited a man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Ramada Inn last year while <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was suspected of trafficking in drugs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has since been convicted in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> of dealing cocaine and has been indicted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on charges that he sold cocaine while he stayed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel last December. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has put the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> situation behind him. `` He feels he has explained -LRB- his relationship with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> -RRB- and that no matter what he says not everyone will believe him.'' Several top aides, including Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, also have resigned. At the same time, the city's homicide rate has soared. Police say the 372 killings in 1988 were a record and that the 229 slayings committed through Thursday this year put the city on pace to far outstrip last yea's total. Authorities estimate at least 60 percent of the homicides have been drug-related. Announced candidates for mayor include <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> and former utility executive <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, both Democrats. They would face <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> in the Democratic primary. Success in the primary is tantamount to a general election victory in this heavily Democratic city.

<TEXT>
 National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said today the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will take a close look at <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> claims that it would give up sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did the same. `` That's one of the open areas in START,'' Scowcroft said in reference to the U.S.-Soviet negotiations to limit strategic arms. `` We've had a number of proposals back and forth. We'll have to look at this one carefully and see what it means.'' However, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said verification remains a serious problem to overcome. Scowcroft, who is in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the economic summit, was interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Col. Gen. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be willing to give up the sea-launched cruise missiles depending on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, chief of the arms control section of the Soviet General Staff, said `` If I were determining policy, then I'd accept it,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The general said it was a `` progressive suggestion'' to eliminate nuclear cruise missiles. The comments marked a departure from the Soviet stance on the issue at the U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations taking place in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The Soviets, said <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON>, would prefer to give up all cruise missiles at sea, but faced with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s strong desire to keep conventionally armed missiles, `` we are coming to this. `` How the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> decides, we'll see,'' <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chervov </PERSON> said the Soviet military budget would decline about 25 percent by 1995. He said defense spending already had been reduced 10 billion rubles, the equivalent of $ 16 billion at official exchange rates, below the government's orginial plan for 1987 and 1988. He said military spending would drop another 10 billion rubles by 1992 and, if circumstances allow, by 10 billion rubles more in the following three years. In May, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviet military budget for 1989 was 77.3 billion rubles, the equivalent of $ 118 billion, and the total would be cut by 10 billion rubles by the end of 1991.

Maintaining it could balance the books with the least impact on the children, <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> community could save about $ 40,000 by firing him and paying a teacher an extra $ 3,000 to run its 200-pupil elementary school. `` Building faculty is the hardest thing to do,'' <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said. `` If we lose our teachers we will never get them back.'' Even though voters in the little town of 1,600 people approved overrides of property tax limits totaling $ 75,000, it was not enough to cover boosts in health insurance, the breakdown of its heating plant and rising tuition costs for its high school students, <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the world's seven richest nations, turning from partying to politics, opened their annual summit today with talks focusing on the economic struggles in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the harsh repression of human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The initial session of the 15th world economic summit began at the new glass Louvre pyramid, now the main entrance and architecturally controversial structure in front of the famed museum. The first order of business was a picture-taking session for the `` class photo'' of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Even before the summit began, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won a victory on a contentious trade issue with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Reversing course, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to hold talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a broad range of trade barriers, which the administration contends are a major cause of the $ 52 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. On the other hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maneuvered unsuccessfully to obtain a final agreement between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its commercial bank lenders on restructuring <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt of more than $ 100 billion. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that no deal is in sight, despite <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s warning that `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is on the edge of an explosion because of the weight of its debt. Today's first session of the Big Seven industrial democracies coincides with the climax of three days of festivities marking the 200th birthday of the French Revolution. The salute to the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of the revolution, began with a military parade down the Champs Elysees, the most famous thoroughfare in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Heavy tanks rumbled past the VIP viewing stand as Mirage jet fighters screamed overhead, trailing streams of red, white and blue smoke _ the colors of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flag. With more than two dozen heads of state and government invited to the festivities, there was an extraordinary gathering of world leaders from nations rich and poor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, got a front row parade seat next to President <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, representing one of the world's poorest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> on his country's commercial lenders. Afterward, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> reported there was no early prospect for a final agreement. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials want `` to get it done correctly rather than trying to rush it,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> believes `` there is no requirement to leave the summit ... with an agreement.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered a loan of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> seal an agreement, preferably before the economic summit ends on Sunday, but <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the negotiations remained snagged over details. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who is pushing a rival plan for solving the Third World debt problem, said in a French TV interview that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign debt has carried that country to the brink of an explosion `` No one has an interest in this explosion taking place, which would mean more misery for a suffering people,'' he said. `` We are contributing, I am contributing, as far as possible so that a positive answer could be given in the coming days.'' The 15th economic summit marks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debut at the annual gathering of the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Leaders of some of the Third World countries attending the Bastille celebration urged the prosperous nations to hold a summit between rich and poor nations. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been harshly criticized in the press here for the extravagence of the bicentennial celebration, as well as for holding two separate dinners tonight for have and have-not nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, through a spokesman, rallied to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s side. `` I do n't think the president sees any difficulty at all in the way the French have laid out their plans, their celebrations, or their hosting of the summit meeting,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped the summit would let him assume the mantle of leadership on economic and environmental issues, much as he did on military matters in May with a troop reduction proposal at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Following his stops this week in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to press for a coordinated economic aid program to reward the two East Bloc nations for democratic reforms. Among other steps, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expected to express support for new loans and debt rescheduling to ease their financial woes. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bloody crackdown on pro-democracy students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and subsequent repressions also were on the agenda. It appeared likely the leaders would approve a statement of concern about events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rather than endorse any collective sanctions. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would welcome a summit statement reiterating previously expressed condemnations and concerns about human rights violations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We know of no specific proposals that go _ that even brings all of the countries up to the levels that the president has gone, much less going further,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has cut off military sales and technology transfers to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, urged a freeze on international loans for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and restricted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic contacts. The summit will turn to economics and other subjects on Saturday and Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking an international agreement on tackling problems of global pollution. Other leaders had their own agendas. Attempting to overcome a sex scandal which has shaken his government, <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Sosouke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> came armed with nearly $ 40 billion in aid to improve the global environment and provide financial support to lessen the staggering $ 1.2 trillion debt burden carried by developing countries. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has his own rival plan for Third World debt. So does <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s treasury secretary, unveiled a strategy March 10 to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of developing nations' bad debt. Security problems of protecting the `` Big Seven'' summit leaders were compounded by the presence of more than 30 presidents and prime ministers who are <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s guests for the bicentennial festivities. Fanning out over an 80-mile circle around <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, 30,000 security forces erected a protective cocoon around the leaders. While an observation blimp hovered over the crowds, sharpshooters kept watch from rooftops and troops armed with ground-to-air missiles kept an eye on the skies.

 A 4-week-old baby suffered two broken arms and a broken leg after being admitted to a hospital for breathing problems, and hospital officials and police say they are trying to learn how it happened. The baby, <PERSON> Jasmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghoston </PERSON>, suffered three fractures in each arm and a fracture in one leg, said officials at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The girl was listed in good condition at Children's Memorial Hospital after her parents transferred her from Mercy on Thursday. `` We wanted to get her out of there,'' said her father, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghoston </PERSON>. `` She was was hurt bad, and they -LRB- hospital officials -RRB- still have n't told us what happened.'' Doctors plan to check the possibility the child suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition in which bones are abnormally brittle, officials at Children's said. The baby was admitted to Mercy on Sunday after her parents noticed she was having difficulty breathing. Two days later, the fractures were discovered. `` A nurse went to feed the baby and noticed a limpness in the limbs. She then called a doctor who took X-rays,'' said Mercy spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Traynor </PERSON>. Police detective Cmdr. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said, `` We do n't know of any criminal activity being involved at this time, but we have n't ruled out anything. `` We do n't know if it was an accident, a medical problem, o if it occurred at the hands of another.'' `` I do n't understand why somebody would want to do this to my little baby,'' said the mother, <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, `` She is so little. It would have to be a very cruel person.'' Mercy's marketing-communications director, <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Zellermeyer </PERSON>, said the hospital is doing its own internal investigation. The family's attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selig </PERSON>, filed a $ 10 million lawuit in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Thursday accusing the hospital of negligence and carelessness. The lawsuit, filed in the child's name, asks for $ 1 million in compensatory damages and $ 9 million in punitive damages. <PERSON> Selig </PERSON> said the girl's parents have been ruled out as suspects. Hospital records show the child was in good health when Ms. <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> left Mercy on Sunday night, and she did not return until Tuesday afternoon, he said. No other family members came to the hospital during that time, <PERSON> Selig </PERSON> said.

 Unidentified men stormed a meeting of Kurdish activists in an apartment and fatally shot three men, including the leader of an anti-Iranian faction, police said today. A fourth man, a Kurd bearing an Iranian diplomatic passport was seriously wounded, said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON>, a police chief in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Police said the dead included <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON>, 59, leader of the anti-Iranian wing of the Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and small enclaves of 500,000 each in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> said the other two killed were <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghaderi-Azar </PERSON>, 37, a Kurd who police said had identification papers issued by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and Iraq-born <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mala </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasoul </PERSON>, 38, who has held Austrian citizenship since 1985. The three were living in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> as political exiles. Police refused to release the name of the wounded man, who was shot in the mouth and who had not been interviewed by authorities. <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> said the shooting occurred at 7:20 p.m. Thursday in an apartment near the city center that was made available by an unidentified Austrian woman. `` It seems that more than four people took part'' in the meeting, <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> told reporters. `` We have to assume that it was a political discussion.'' Two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire, <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> said. The three fatalities were shot in the head. It was not clear how the assailants gained entrance to the apartment, since the door was not damaged, the police official said. Qassemlou, who was educated in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, lived there in exile for several years. In an Austrian newspaper interview published in April he said the `` Kurds' war against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'' would continue despite the cease-fire between the two countries since August 1988.

 Mourners streamed into churchyards in several villages today for the funerals of 14 people killed when a farmer ran amok with a double-barreled shotgun. Bastille Day celebrations were canceled, and decorative flags and bunting removed from streets and buildings. The gunman, who was seriously wounded in a shootout with police, was moved today from a hospital in <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Fresne </LOCATION> prison hospital near <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He was charged with murder and attempted murder, police said. Investigators and witnesses described how <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>, 31, shot his mother and sister to death, wounded his father, then got in his car and drove around this village of 128 people and neighboring communities for about two hours, firing at anyone he saw. The spree came to an end in <LOCATION> Verne </LOCATION>, where officers returned fire and hit him in the abdomen, said a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> headquarters of the gendarmerie, the military police responsible for public order in rural <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>, with the only functioning church in the area, was the site of the largest funeral service. Eight people, including two children, were buried in a ceremony there attended by relatives, friends and more than 1,000 sympathizers. Separate funerals were held in other villages for the six other victims. Seven of the dead were from <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION>. The others came from the nearby communities of <LOCATION> Anteuil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Autechaux </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sechin </PERSON>, Fourbanne, <PERSON> Baume-les-Dames </PERSON>, and Voillans. Neighbors said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> had frightened them long before the dramatic events of Wednesday afternoon. Dornier was under heavy police guard partly for his own protection `` from the irate citizens,'' the genedarmerie spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesman said investigators were taking seriously reports that local people had privately threatened Dornier. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case is expected to decide next week whether Dornier must stand trial or be considered legally insane. The maximum penalty for murder in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is life in prison. If someone is ruled insane, he can be interned in a psychiatric institution as long as necessary. `` We knew he would create havoc one day and the police should have dealt with him months ago. Unfortunately, our laws do n't allow such preventive action,'' said <PERSON> Dominque </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenot </PERSON>, a member of the village council. `` Everyone here was afraid of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>, whose father is mayor. `` His behavior was strange. No one ever complained to the police about him, but we all knew.'' `` Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> said of his brother. `` He had no friends, hardly ever talked to anyone. A few weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut. He did strange things like that and we did not pay much attention.'' The village council had decided no action was called for because <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION> had never been in trouble with the law. `` We advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment, and they did,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON>, a council member. A psychiatrist came regularly from nearby Baume-les-Dames and prescribed tranquilizers, but <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> said his brother did not take them.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cassette of hit songs from the Cultural Revolution _ including `` Without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> There Would Be No <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' and `` Party, Beloved Mother'' _ have reappeared in music stores. Videocassettes of burned corpses, crowds stoning soldiers and tanks on fire also are being sold, purporting to tell `` The True Story of the Turmoil,'' as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> puts every medium to use in its campaign against counterrevolutionaries. Newspapers recently promoted the cassette tape with 10 top hits from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s early revolutionary years and the 1966-76 leftist Cultural Revolution. Among the popular songs are `` Socialism is Good,'' `` Without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> There Would Be No <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' `` I Am a Soldier'' and `` Party, Beloved Mother.'' The tape began appearing in stores this week, and sales figures were not available. The lyrics carry the same message party leaders have been preaching since the army put down student-led pro-democracy protests June 3-4: `` Unity is strength, this strength is iron, this strength is steel.'' `` I am a soldier, I come from the ordinary people, I love the country and love the people.'' In `` Socialism is Good,'' the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Song </ORGANIZATION> and Dance Troupe sings: `` The reactionaries have been overthrown, the imperialists have run away with their tails between their legs.'' The collection stays away from Cultural Revolution songs that idolized <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, and only one song refers to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> as `` our leader.'' The message of the videotape is less subtle. Charred corpses of soldiers killed by angry <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents and footage of crowds stoning soldiers during the weekend attack are accompanied by a narrative that condemns `` handfuls of thugs'' said to be responsible. The nearly hour-long video, titled `` The True Story of the Turmoil,'' went on sale to foreigners Thursday for the first time at a seminar for foreign travel agents. For about $ 8, buyers can watch crowds set tanks on fire, topple buses and surround jeeps of soldiers in desperate efforts to keep the army from reaching <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> where the students were camped. A narrator describes the action in English: `` The rebels climb on an armored vehicle and open it. This is rampant counterrevolutionary arrogance. ... A group of thugs goes on beating, smashing, plundering and burning.'' The tape shows no footage of soldiers opening fire, nor does it mention that they did, and it does not contain the sound of chanting protesters or gunfire. The government has been distributing the tape internally and among its foreign embassies. It has not yet appeared for sale in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> stores, but all the footage was shown repeatedly on national television in the days after the crackdown. Along with the copies sold to foreigners came a note, complete with official seal, asking customs officials to allow it out of the country. Authorities have been confiscating private tapes and photographs showing the violence. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> tourism officials said they have sold 60 copies of the tape, which they hope will silence foreign criticism of the crackdown and encourage foreign businessmen and tourists to return.

The officials, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> would discuss preparations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for national elections next Feb. 25. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has accused the Sandinista government of trying to rig the process in its favor. But Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommitttee on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said Thursday he expects the Nicaraguan elections will be free and fair and that the Sandinista goverment deserves some credit from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration The consultations on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are expected to center on next Wednesday's meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The ministers are scheduled to receive a report from a team of mediators who have been trying to achieve a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in accordance with an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mandate. According to the officials, <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> briefed a number of Latin American ambassadors on Thursday about the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> told the envoys that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, consistent with Latin American wishes, has adopted a low profile on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation in the interest of seeking a resolution of the problem through hemispheric consensus, the officials said. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> also said it would be unfortunate for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> if the mediators failed to achieve a solution in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that would result in the transfer of power from Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, to an elected civilian government, the officials said. At his news conference Thursday, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> for what he said was its ineffective response to the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> can not deal with the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> problem, `` I do n't think we can get together on anything,'' he said. `` They might as well close down the -LRB- OAS -RRB- building.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has faced an uncertain political future since the results of the May 7 national elections were thrown out by Panamanian authorities. Independent observers had maintained that the presidential candidate opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> scored a landslide victory.

 A former Housing and Urban Development official today contradicted onetime <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s sworn statement that he played no direct role in deciding which housing projects received <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> financing. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, former general deputy assistant secretary for housing, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> called her and instructed her to approve millions of dollars for a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, project sought by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s former law partner <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s exact words to her were, ` I want the project funded'.'' `` I ca n't fund it but I will send it upstairs to you,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said she told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. As a result of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, the developers received more than $ 11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $ 2.3 million urban development action grant and more than $ 3 million in tax credits, said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on unemployment and housing. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, testified that on her first day on the job, she was directed by <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, to `` forward'' the funding documents on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project. However, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s signature was already on the documents approving funding for the project. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel in May that he had no direct role in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions. Since then, however, there have been reports that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> intervened on behalf of associates, including the one-time law partner, former <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who was seeking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> financing for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project. Both former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> aides testified under oath, as had <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> earlier. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who has returned to the practice of law and business pursuits in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, has been recalled by the panel for further questioning. But no date has been set for his appearance. Sources told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who for three years was <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s top aide, sought immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony implicating <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. However, congressional sources said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> hoped to gain that information independent of Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` The granting of immunity is not under active consideration by the subcommittee,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said today. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> last month refused to answer questions from the subcommittee, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. One of the sources said that if granted immunity, Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was prepared to testify that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered funding for numerous projects under the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. The program was suspended briefly earlier this year and its selection guidelines rewritten after <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditors criticized project selections. Auditors said influential Republicans had successfully lobbied <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in favor of projects involving their clients. Ms. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> has said she quit her job as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for housing because <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered her to fund the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project over the objections of other agency officials. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> replaced Ms. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> with Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, now a specialist in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, who in 1985 approved funding for the project. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> also testified that she was lobbied by <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest private lender that underwrote mortgages in a $ 5 billion <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> coinsurance program. DRG at the time was on probation. Ms. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> went over her head to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> after failing to convince her that the restrictions should be lifted. `` It was later brought to my attention that <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> had ... taken the case to Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. I was informed by staff that there was a meeting,'' and <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION>'s probation was lifted, she said. DRG now is the subject of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> criminal investigation, and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials believe the government may lose as much as $ 500 million because of <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of government-backed loans. New <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said earlier this week that abuses at the agency during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration _ the period of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure _ cost <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the `` ballpark'' of $ 2 billion A <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aide said Thursday that more than half of that amount, $ 1.1 billion, was believed to have been lost by just one program, a co-insurance venture administered by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> hired attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> to head a program that had losses three years earlier estimated at $ 240,000. The paper said the losses occurred because <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> made false statements working as a settlement attorney in real estate transactions from 1982 to 1984. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON>, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to one count of making a false statement and has been ordered to report in mid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence, the paper said. <PERSON> Novick </PERSON> had worked for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as an attorney before going into private practice. He was rehired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in February 1987 after talking with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, then assistant secretary for housing. In other developments Thursday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted to launch its own <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigation _ That committee also approved the nomination of <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> II as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, a post that will have a key role in agency dealings with investigations by law enforcement agencies _ An aide to the Lantos subcommittee said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, will appear before the panel next week to face questions about her lobbying of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials after she left the agency _ A Houston-area lawyer acknowledged he has been barred from doing business with the federal government because he was slow in turning over some $ 1.5 million from sales of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> property Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he had not kept any money, and a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed that almost all the money had been recovered.

<DATELINE>ST. GENGOUX DE SCISSE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just like <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, this hamlet deep in wine-growing Burgundy went out of its way to make its bicentennial celebration an unparalleled event. Unlike Parisians, however, the 548 villagers could get a close look at the fireworks display, the first ever in the history of St. Gengoux. They also had no trouble parking and did n't complain about the cost of it all. That does n't mean the festivities were a cinch for mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON>. `` We had worries to organize this,'' he said. `` For the official toast, we had to get our hands on 200 glasses and think who would do the washing up afterward.'' With all eyes glued on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> where world leaders marked the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution in pomp, splendor and grandeur, hundreds of villages around <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> celebrated with a simple `` bal populaire,'' and heaps of food and wine. On the eve of Bastille Day, the children of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gengoux </PERSON> marched around the village carrying colorful lanterns. The elders, dressed in period costumes, followed and chanted revolutionary slogans such as `` That's enough. We'll hang the aristocracy!'' and `` Down with the nobility and clergy!'' when they passed the 11th century church. But times have changed. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gengoux </PERSON> no longer has a resident priest, the sole policeman did not have to protect anyone from the outrage of the people, and by 3:30 a.m. the locals were swaying to `` Rock Around the Clock'' by <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> and the Comets. One thing was missing, though. For the first time in memory, the brass band, rich in trophies and local history, did not lead the procession. After the previous mayor lost the March elections, his son and cousin quit the band, taking with them their bugle and big drum. `` What a pity we had to miss that,'' said <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON>, echoing the complaints of many villagers. But it hardly dampened the enthusiasm during the simple festivities. `` Here, everything is very down to earth,'' said baker <PERSON> Jeannot </PERSON> <PERSON> Breton </PERSON>. `` We celebrate among ourselves. We do n't have an orgy of money,'' he said. The mayor runs the July 14 celebrations on a budget of less than $ 1,500. `` Of course, we do n't have to receive heads of state,'' he said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gengoux </PERSON>, basking amid the lush, sloping hills of eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, produces simple <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> white wines from Chardonnay grapes, but without the fame or prices of the Burgundy wines from around <LOCATION> Beaune </LOCATION>, 40 miles to the north. Friday's celebrations ended with the bicentennial `` <PERSON> Repas </PERSON> <PERSON> Populaire </PERSON>,'' a rich five-course meal for about $ 7.50 a plate, but with wine and coffee offered by the village. More than 200 people showed up in the <LOCATION> Salle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fetes </LOCATION>, decorated in the French colors for the occasion. During the two days, only one big speech was made, but even then it hardly resembled the heady rhetoric heard in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where the Revolution was lauded as one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s greatest contributions to humanity. The people here have their ideas what 1789 means. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gengoux </LOCATION>, there were attacks during the revolutionary summer to destroy everything that represented the nobility and clergy but no major massacres occured. `` Like everywhere, July 14 means liberty. We have maintained it and even abused it a lot,'' <PERSON> Breton </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s colonial past `` When something is forbidden, we are the first to do it,'' he said. The quest for an egalitarian society however has partly failed, said <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON>. `` The differences are still there, but they are not so big as 200 years ago,'' he said. `` Some privileges have survived,'' he said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gengoux </PERSON> will continue to celebrate until the end of July to commemorate events in the region itself. `` On July 14, nothing happened here,'' said <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON>. `` There was no television to see live how the Bastille was taken.''

 A smoky mattress fire on the 17th floor of a <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> forced evacuation of about 50 guests and employees Friday. No injuries were reported. Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrossen </PERSON> said a mattress in a service corridor caught fire. He said the cause was not known.

She said the child has a heart condition but suffered no apparent harm. The fire chief credited a sprinkler system, smoke detectors and an air-tight stairwell for confining the blaze, and called the damage minimal.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Friday accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command of infiltrating its waters with three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> combat vessels June 23 to provoke another Korean war. North Korean army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON>, speaking at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also said South Korean troops opened fire June 28 at a communist guard post along the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries. He said the incidents were part of an effort to increase tensions and prepare for a new war on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was stockpiling arms. No casualties were reported in the incidents. The commission meeting, held in the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, had been called by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, senior delegate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, rejected <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s charges as `` fabrications and fiction'' aimed at propaganda. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said his command investigated the claims and the charges were unfounded. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> earlier reported the incidents in a radio broadcast and a message. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said he had proposed a joint investigation but the communist side did not respond. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was formed at the start of the 1950-53 Korean War to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> repel communist invaders. The joint armistice commission is charged with maintaining the cease-fire that ended the war and meets periodically at the request of either side. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> alleged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deploys more than 1,000 nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and has recently brought in modern jet fighters. He also charged that the command conducted more than 800 reconnaissance flights over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> this year. On the alleged arms buildup, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said the command has been forced to take `` firm actions in self-defense'' since 1957 when he said the command temporarily suspended a section of the armistice agreement which bans the introduction of reinforcing weapons. He said this was done in order to counter <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s arms buildup. <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> did not respond. Also Friday, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest opposition party accused President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> of `` political suppression'' and urged his government to scrap plans to question opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>. Lawmakers from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> joined forces in demanding intelligence agents stop harassing the party head and withdraw a request to question him about a party lawmaker's illegal trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> has asked to question <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and other senior party members in connection with a secret trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in August by lawmaker <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>, who has been arrested. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> turned down two agency requests Thursday and Friday to answer questions, saying he had nothing to tell about <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip. Trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without prior government approval are a crime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which maintains all contacts and dialogue with <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> must be made through official channels.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Roman Catholic bishop of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has appealed for international pressure on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to offer refuge to the territory's people as a safeguard from the uncertain future under communist rule. Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, in a letter to about 2,500 cardinals and bishops seen Friday, also urged pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end persecution of participants in the crushed pro-democracy movement. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has agreed to return <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997, and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has promised that the territory can maintain its capitalist economy and enjoy a `` high degree of autonomy'' for another 50 years. But the June 3-4 military suppression of the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and subsequent crackdown on dissent throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has led to a loss of confidence in the future among the 5.7 million people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` These events have shaken not just <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the entire world,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has felt particularly deeply the sufferings of its Chinese brothers and sisters.'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> argued that recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have increased anxieties in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and he said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> had a constitutional and moral obligation to provide safeguards for the territory's people. `` A right to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> would, in no small measure, help restore people's confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' he said, echoing arguments made by many of the colony's public opinion leaders. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> appealed to his fellow churchmen to urge their governments and international bodies to use their influence with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` to ensure that the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> enjoy all those safeguards from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> which are their right.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> church spokesman Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ha </PERSON> said the right to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> was such a safeguard. The British government, however, has stated it will grant the right of abode to only a fraction of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people. No details of the plan have been released. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> also wrote emotionally about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on dissent, calling it a `` reign of terror.'' He urged church leaders to seek support for pressure on the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government `` to put an end to all persecution and ensure those who have already been arrested are given fair trials.'' The letter also discussed another sensitive issue in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the wave of Vietnamese who have sailed from their communist homeland to this territory in search of a new life. Nearly 50,000 `` boat people'' languish in local camps. Overseas resettlement of boat people has slowed down, leading to a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government decision to seek the repatriation of all Vietnamese who fled their homeland for economic reasons. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is almost at the end of its tether and desperate to find a solution for this crisis,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> wrote. In his letter, the cardinal asked for help in offering the Vietnamese `` permanent homes as soon as possible'' in other countries. Nearly 270,000 people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> are Roman Catholic, or about 5 percent of the population. The church wields much influence in the community, as it runs almost 300 schools and many medical services.

 A pilot who miraculously survived an 800-mile flight while he was unconscious had been shot through the abdomen at some point before he crash-landed in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and swam to rescuers, police said today. `` It was unquestionably a gunshot wound,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` The surgeons at the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said there was a wound that passed through the left rib cage, -LRB- and the colon -RRB-, exited and struck him in the arm and exited again.'' Authorities have not recovered the small-caliber gun that caused the wound and believe it went down with the plane. Authorities earlier had speculated that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> may have had a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide. The chief said a powder burn indicated Root was shot at close range, but did not say it was self-inflicted. `` That's all a matter of speculation right now,'' he said. `` There is always the possibility of -LRB- a -RRB- self-inflicted wound.'' <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said that Root could have been shot before takeoff, but that the wound is believed to have occurred in the air. A colleague at Root's law firm described him as a gun collector. Military pilots who saw Root in the plane did n't see anyone else aboard, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the police version of events, but <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> also said Root had suffered a gunshot wound. An air safety investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, said at a news conference that there was no conclusive evidence that <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s injury was a gunshot wound, although he acknowledged that there was a `` burn area'' around the wound. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said doctors had removed a `` very, very small fragment of metal'' from Root. He said it would be analyzed to determine if it was part of a bullet. Root remained in stable condition under heavy sedation at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s Memorial Hospital today. His odyssey started on a flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and ended when he crashed after his single-engine plane ran out of fuel 10,000 feet above <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> waters early Thursday afternoon. For nearly four hours, military jets shadowed the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 Centurion as it traveled down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on autopilot with the 36-year-old lawyer from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, slumped in the cockpit. `` I thought there was no way he was going to survive that crash,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, one of four specially trained rescuers who parachuted to the crash site, about 15 miles east of the island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION> and nearly 800 miles from his planned destination. Wearing only pants and socks, Root managed to swim clear of the craft minutes before it sank in nearly 10,000 feet of water. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, a doctor who treated Root in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, said Root may have been jarred awake by the impact and flood of water. `` It's definitely a miracle he's alive. He's a little confused by it all,'' the doctor said. `` I asked him what happened. He said he did n't know. He said he passed out in the plane, and the next thing he knew water was coming in and he was sinking.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, who found no signs of a heart attack and said Root had no history of diabetes, had speculated that the veteran pilot may have passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit. But even before the gunshot wound was reported, the federal official leading an investigation into the incident challenged that theory. `` I personally do n't think carbon monoxide was the cause,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. `` If he was exposed to carbon monoxide for that length of time, there would be more medical problems. `` There are still a lot of unanswered questions.'' <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> said there are no plans to search for remains of the plane. There initially were plans to interview Root at the hospital today, but <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the interview was postponed until at least Saturday because of Root's sedation. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government has authority over the case but has asked the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to run the investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was joining the investigation. `` There are many questions I'll be asking,'' <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. A paralegal who works at Root's firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he may have been carrying guns in the plane. `` Mr. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> is a gun collector and I've been under the impression that he has been involved in selling some of his guns,'' said <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilperoort </PERSON>. `` My assumption is that he had some -LRB- guns -RRB- in the plane and something went off when the plane went down.'' Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s family had requested that no information be released on the exact extent of his injuries. Root underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery Thursday. Root's wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, 35, planned to visit her husband today. On Thursday, she said she told hospital officials to send her husband the message: `` Root, you really did it this time.'' She told reporters Thursday night that he had suffered a fainting spell about two months ago. She also said he had often flown private planes on business trips. `` For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into shock,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` We did n't expect this story to have a happy ending.'' Nearly two hours after <PERSON> Root </PERSON> took off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> about 6:30 a.m., he radioed air traffic controllers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that he was having chest pain and trouble breathing. `` Yessir, we're having a little problem up here. Seem to have a little trouble breathing,'' said Root to an unidentified controller, according to tapes broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Moments later, radio contact was broken. Military pilots who tailed the plane reported the craft occasionally moved within 100 miles of the shore and was traveling at more than 150 miles an hour. Seven military aircraft and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate were pressed into service as thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> followed the ordeal with minute-by-minute radio bulletins. The plane began to lose altitude about 250 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and quickly dropped to 7,000 feet. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lt </ORGANIZATION>. Commander <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poll </PERSON> said the plane then spiraled down at about 2,000 feet per minute. The nose and left wing hit the water and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360-degree spin. It sunk a few minutes later. Moments after impact, the four-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> team from the <ORGANIZATION> 301st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> parachuted 3,000 feet above the crash site. Root clung to a raft tossed from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane. `` He was just barely hanging on,'' said rescue team member Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. `` It was remarkable to see someone with that tenacity to live. I'll never forget the sight of seeing him alive.''

 Through a pair of lunches and a dinner, an opera and a parade, leaders of two dozen poor nations rubbed elbows and clinked glasses with the heads of the seven wealthiest democracies. But <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s bicentennial ball ended Friday and the poorer relations turned back into pumpkins. It was all the doing of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who scheduled the 15th annual economic summit of industrialized nations to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. For a day and a half, the seven summiteers mingled with the other world leaders who had been invited to the bicentennial festivities. But the summit officially opened Friday, and Friday's dinner was for members only. While <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> hosted and toasted his rich counterparts, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s other guests were shunted off to be entertained by Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and the president's wife, <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON>. The logistical necessity of veering the `` Big Seven'' from the bicentennial festivities and into the economic summit caused no little embarrassment for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his government. There seemed no way to do it without appearing to be handing out second-class tickets to the little guys. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> _ the `` advocate of the poor,'' as his aides repeat ceaselessly _ counts among his guests for the bicentennial party some of the planet's most economically strapped countries, such as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, and the most deeply indebted, such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some of the summit participants, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, were adamantly opposed to mixing the two events to the point where the economic summit became a major North-South event. Though debt will be one of the main topic of the summit, the richer countries want to keep to the original economic summit framework created by former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing in 1975. The summits have grown considerably beyond the informal economic chats <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> envisaged for that first event at <LOCATION> Rambouillet </LOCATION>. But the principal task remains keeping the world's seven locomotive economies perking along in good order, and in turn helping the less healthy. Nonetheless, the proximity of the North-South leaders afforded a golden opportunity for sleeve-tugging by the poor and largess-dispensing by the rich. `` We have not tried to organize a North-South summit,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Attali </PERSON>, special counsellor to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and the main organizer of the summit. `` On the other hand, on July 12, 13 and 14 there will be North-South meetings at the summit level.'' In the framework of the bicentennial celebrations, the summit participants and the leaders of the small nations attended a lavish lunch together on Thursday, dined as a group in the evening and at lunch again Friday. They sat side-by-side at the opening of the new <ORGANIZATION> Bastille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and again at Friday's military parade, where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, leader of the world's wealthiest nation, had a seat in the reviewing stand next to <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. `` They will be all together,'' <PERSON> Attali </PERSON> repeated again and again at pre-summit press briefings. `` They will participate in all the ceremonies together. They will have numerous bilaterial meetings.'' That is, until the summit began. Enter the dinner flap. Originally, the summit participants were to have their first meal alone at the French Admiralty with the other bicentennial guests dining at the Crillon Hotel on Place de la Concorde. As embarrassment mounted, however, the plans were changed and both dinners were scheduled for the Admiralty _ but in different rooms. The menu for both groups was the same _ terrine of lamb, fried sea perch, cheese, bread and olives. Dessert was bitter chocolate shells filled with ice cream sweetened with lavender honey. The wine was Chateau-Rayas 1945. The respected <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> said the change came on the personal order of <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who was trying to smooth any feathers that might be ruffled between lunch and dinner.

 Masked Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today fatally stabbed a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Soldiers reportedly wounded at least 11 Arabs in clashes. The army ordered 150,000 Palestinians to remain in their homes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to prevent violence on the second day of a major Moslem holiday. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a Jewish man was beaten to death near the southern town of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> and police were questioning four Arabs, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. It said the victim, an elderly building contractor, was killed by two of his Arab workers to whom he owned money. Initial reports said police suspected the killing could have been linked to the uprising. The killing raised anti-Arab emotions in the town, and angry residents gathered in the streets to demand that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers be banned from entering, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reports said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists killed 26-year-old <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Amasi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <PERSON> Amasi </PERSON> was a hashish dealer and a suspected collaborator with Israeli security forces, the reports said. The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating. <PERSON> Amasi </PERSON>'s death brought to 561 the number of Palestinians killed in the 19-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Most victims died in army gunfire, but more than 70 have been killed as alleged collaborators. Thirty-five Israelis have been slain. Clashes occurred between soldiers and stone-throwing youths today in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Jabaliya refugee camps and in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The reports said 11 Palestinians were wounded. The army said it was checking the reports. Curfews confining people to their homes were reported in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp and nearby villages. Army checkpoints also blocked entry to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on some roads from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The moves came as Moslems observed <PERSON> Eid </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Adha </PERSON>, four days of feasting marking the end of the annual pilgrimmage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, meanwhile, an Israel-backed Lebanese militiaman was killed and two others were wounded when a mine exploded near <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army said. The victims were members of the Israeli-financed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia, which helps patrol the 6 - to 10-mile-wide strip <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> created in 1985 to protect its northern border from attack

<TEXT>
 Government officials and U.S.-backed rebels will resume peace talks Sunday in the Zairean capital of <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported. Without identifying its sources, the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Jornal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the talks originally were to start Saturday but were postponed to allow Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> to return from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he has been attending bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> was named mediator of a commission to negotiate an end to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war at a June 22 African summit where Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to a cease-fire and peace talks. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> called a government delegation home from <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> two weeks ago after only two days of talks with the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, claiming the rebels violated the June 24 cease-fire. The decision to resume comes on the heels of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, who apparently encouraged <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> to reopen talks. According to <PERSON> Jornal </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Angola </PERSON>, next week's talks will focus on the integration of guerrillas into Angolan society and institutions. African diplomats in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> say the talks probably will deal with ways of policing the truce. Government reports have said guerrillas cut power lines to the capital and killed civilians in a number of attacks breaking the cease-fire. The rebels have said both sides have committed minor violations. The rebels' Voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cockerel </ORGANIZATION> radio station, monitored Thursday in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, said a rebel delegation already is in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, `` waiting for the government.'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s armed forces chief, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> was expected to head the government delegation, that also is slated to include <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' presidential secretary on defense and security, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. The rapprochement follows a December regional accord under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to pull out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in return for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops helping <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government fight the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is eager for membership of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> recognition withheld since a Marxist-oriented government seized power after the country gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has pledged to continue aid to the guerrillas, estimated at $ 15 million a year, during a two-year period of national reconciliation.

 After searching seven years for one of the nation's worst serial killers, police say a former law student is a `` viable suspect'' in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings of 48 women, and perhaps other killings in the Northwest. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38, who is serving a jail term for burglary, was named in an affidavit made public Thursday. The affidavit was filed to obtain a warrant to search two of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' residences in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, 290 miles east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Records obtained thus far have failed to provide him with an alibi for any of the 49 suspected <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> homicides, or any of those in the cities of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>,'' the affidavit said. `` Instead, interviews and records have produced the following facts that tend to establish that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is a viable suspect in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> homicides and possibly others in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>.'' While the affidavit said there were 49 murders linked to the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killer, King County Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of a task force investigating the case, said today there were only 48. Police searched the residences Wednesday, producing an additional truckload of material including crime reports, 1,800 videotapes, maps, credit cards, 14 police badges and two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> police uniform shirts, according to court documents. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said today that some of the videotapes were homemade and that others were commercially produced. He declined to say what any of the tapes depicted. Forty to 50 cartons of confiscated materials arrived in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon, and it could take a month or longer to sort through them, police said. The Green River case involves the deaths of 40 women and the disappearance of at least eight others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1985. Most of the victims were young and almost all were linked to prostitution. Early victims were found along or near the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The nationally syndicated television show `` Manhunt'' aired a program on the slayings Dec. 8. It generated thousands of calls, including one from a viewer who told police to check a third-year student at <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, said King County Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of a task force investigating the case. After finding <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, police found he had walked away from a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> work release center in January 1981, before finishing a one-year sentence for burglarizing a police equipment store. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was rearrested Jan. 10 and is serving the rest of that burglary sentence, plus an additional term for escape that will expire Sept. 25, in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. He has not been arrested or charged in connection with any of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings. The affidavit also said the basement of a house <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> owned near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> contained a secret room hidden behind a sliding bookcase. The bookcase was activated by a switch on the wall or an electric garage door opener. The home, which <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> owned from 1981 to 1985, was one of several residences he had during the period, the affidavit said. Several people quoted in the affidavit said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he liked pornography, frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of mutilated women. His father told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his attorney had advised him not to speak with reporters. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> declined a visit from an AP reporter Thursday night. `` Any allegations of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> being involved in that kind of a serious crime are purely ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Beles </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' attorneys. <PERSON> Beles </PERSON> said he thinks the task force is `` grabbing at straws.'' Besides the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> slayings, the affidavit said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> may be linked to an unidentified number of bodies found along highways between <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. After rearresting <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, police searched his room in his parents' <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> home after finding that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> owned a former patrol car from <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and had equipped it `` like a real police car,'' the affidavit said. Investigators had speculated that `` the killer could be a cop or someone posing as a cop,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. During that search police also found credit card receipts that helped them trace <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' moves during the years of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings. The materials found in Wednesday's searches at the parents' home and at a rental home near <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> did not include any clothing, jewelry or other effects belonging to any of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims, most of whom were found naked. There was `` no smoking gun,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Items seized included police records of sex crimes from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. In the affidavit, police quoted friends of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> saying he had tried to pass himself off as a policeman and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent who went on `` missions.'' Some said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would be hyperactive after these missions and `` acted very weird while ` coming down,''' the affidavit said. The 40-page document said the task forcereceived several tips about <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in 1986, including a call from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> saying <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told friends the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings were done for snuff films _ pornographic films that purport to show actual killings.

 Chinese censors have pledged to expunge unacceptable political works from bookstores, official reports said Friday, and prosecutors said they will continue to punish dissidents `` without mercy.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> officials also warned that more than a month after the bloody military demolition of the student-led pro-democracy movement that `` counterrevolutionary'' resistance persists, and the capture of rebels is crucial to the survival of the state. Two more protesters were executed in southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, a foreign source in the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> provincial capital said Friday, bringing to 29 the known number put to death for actions during the past month of social unrest. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and Publications Administrations has taken new measures to clean up the publishing industry, the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported It said there will be tighter surveillance of pornographic material and a sweep against `` counterrevolutionary and bourgeois liberalization propaganda.'' Already, Culture Ministry workers have raided bookstalls to remove works by scholars wanted by police for advocating democratic reform before the June 3-4 military assault crushed the pro-democracy movement and solidified power for senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other aging ideologues. Before then, writers enjoyed a period of relative freedom of expression, and publishers sought profits from adventure stories and romances, some of dubious taste, popular among the general public. It said censors in the past had not been strict enough and publishing companies `` pursuing economic results gave up principle and flooded the book market with low-grade and vulgar materials which contain violent murders and obscene pornography which have corrupted people's souls.'' The Beijing Daily quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiyan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy secretary for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as saying organizers of the `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' still are at large and `` their capture is of vital importance to the survival of the party, the stability of the society and the fundamental interest of the people.'' He said the counterrevolutionaries, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s term for leaders of the democracy movement, `` are so arrogant that they are still distributing anti-revolutionary rumor, resorting to demagoguery ... and putting up a vain resistance.'' At the same meeting of senior <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> officials, municipal party chief <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> said supporters of `` bourgeois liberalization,'' of Western ideas and culture, `` will never accept their defeat ... but use every method to spoil our most important work.'' In a separate report from the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, senior prosecutor <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinwen </PERSON> said all those who violated the law during the recent unrest will be punished `` without mercy.'' Feng called for speedy trials and harsh verdicts for such crimes as organizing and planning riots and rebellion in collaboration with reactionary forces at home and abroad in an attempt to overthrow the socialist system, inciting people to riot with counterrevolutionary slogans, beating and killing troops, destroying or setting fire to military vehicles and seizing weapons. In <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, two men were executed July 8 for `` beating, smashing, looting and burning'' _ a catchall of crimes <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> uses for rioting, a foreign source said Friday, quoting local press reports. The source said the <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> court sentenced another man to death with a two-year stay of execution and gave life sentences to three others, one for arson and two for `` hooliganism.'' <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> courts in the past week have sentenced 20 others to prison terms ranging from five years to life, he said. Up to 30 people were killed in clashes between police and rioters in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> on June 4 and 5. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says about 200 civilians were killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Chinese sources and Western diplomats say thousands were slain. Meanwhile, officials continued a concerted campaign to convince foreign tourists and businessmen they should return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The capital on Friday opened an international trade fair with exhibits from 24 countries, and <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the `` festive and friendly atmosphere at the fair did not seem to be affected by the martial law still going on in the city.''

 <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said she never gave up hope her husband would survive, even as his small plane flew hundreds of miles out of control with pilot <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> apparently unconscious in the cockpit. Police said today that <PERSON> Root </PERSON> had been shot through the abdomen before his plane crash-landed in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said Root had been shot at close range, but did n't say the wound was self-inflicted. Authorities earlier had speculated that Root had suffered a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> also said that Root had been shot. However, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the police version of events. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, an air safety investigator, said there was no conclusive evidence that <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s injury was a gunshot wound, although he acknowledged there was a `` burn area'' around the wound <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said doctors had removed a `` very, very small fragment of metal,'' which would be analyzed to determine if it was part of a bullet. Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, who was en route to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, could not immediately be reached for comment about the police reports. Earlier, <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s family requested that Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> not release any information on his injuries. Root remained in stable condition today under heavy sedation after undergoing three hours of exploratory surgery. <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilperoort </PERSON>, a paralegal at Root's firm, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> <PERSON> P.C. </PERSON>, said today that <PERSON> Root </PERSON> is a gun collection. `` I've been under the impression that he has been involved in selling some of his guns,'' she said. `` My assumption is that he had some -LRB- guns -RRB- in the plane and something went off when the plane went down.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON>, a researcher the firm, said he was unaware of any problems facing Root. `` There was no outward appearance of any undue stress or any set of circumstances that would lead or contribute to, as is being hinted at, an apparent suicide attempt,'' <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> said. `` It was like a roller coaster,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, 35, said Thursday about the daylong wait before her husband was rescued after incredibly surviving the crash. And her message to her husband? `` I said to tell him, ` Root, you really did it this time,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said she told hospital officials who called her from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The 36-year-old lawyer was flying his own plane to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> when he became ill. His plane winged southward, running out of fuel and crashing into the ocean where <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> parachutists pulled him from the water `` This is somebody you've loved and lived with a long time. The suddenness of it is breathtaking, awful,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> after her agonizing eight hours of uncertainty. `` It was very exhausting, very difficult to deal with.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said she first heard her husband's flight was in trouble around 8 a.m. when air traffic control officials called to say they `` had not heard from him.'' She said she was updated throughout day about the status of plane and eventually saw TV pictures of her husband being pulled from the water. Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, who celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary last week, said she never gave up hope her husband would survive. `` I decided I was not going to believe he was dead until they told me he was dead,'' she said. But she said the hours of uncertainty were `` horrible, awful. It's a terrible feeling.'' Coast Guard Capt. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said Root may have passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him. Mrs. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said she told only the oldest of their three children, 7-year-old T.J. -LRB- <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> -RRB-, what had happened, and `` he took it very hard and was very sad, and very elated when we found out he had been pulled out of the water.'' The couple's other two children, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, are 4 and 1.

 Three Tamil Tiger rebels met with moderate Tamil leaders and fatally shot two of their hosts before they were killed by bodyguards, officials said Friday. <PERSON> Appapillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirthalingam </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Vettivelu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yogeswaran </PERSON>, a party colleague, were killed Thursday at their common residence in the city. <PERSON> Sarojini </PERSON> <PERSON> Yogeswaran </PERSON>, speaking Friday before a court of inquiry, told Magistrate <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> that she offered tea and biscuits to the three visitors. `` They were having a friendly discussion for about 20 minutes and then we heard loud noises,'' she said. Several people ran into the room and found the two Tamil leaders lying in a pool of blood and heard more shooting outside, she said. Police said all three assailants were shot and killed by bodyguards. Another Tamil front leader, <PERSON> Murugesu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sivasithamparam </PERSON>, was seriously wounded in the shooting. Mrs. <PERSON> Yogeswaran </PERSON> named two of the visitors as Visvu and <PERSON> Aloysius </PERSON> and said they were <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. A statement Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, however, denied involvement in the murders and said the suggestions had emanated from the Indian High Commission, or embassy. `` We deny categorically the reports emanating from <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> that one of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the killings,'' the statement said. An <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules, denied the mission had suggested a Tamil Tiger involvement. `` Perhaps it is only their guilty conscience speaking,'' he said, refusing to elaborate. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. The rebels claim Tamils are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has differed with demands by the government and the Tiger rebels that Indian soldiers posted on the island nation be withdrawn. The demand followed talks in May between the rebels and the government, the first direct contact between the two sides since the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> launched a war for an independent nation in 1983. Amirthalingam in public statements welcomed the demand but said the withdrawal should be gradual and done only after political powers were given to the Tamils. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it will pull out its estimated 40,000 troops after this condition is met. <PERSON> Amirthalingam </PERSON>, a lawyer, was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1956. His party became the second largest group in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after the 1977 elections but was relegated to the background after the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> launched their militant movement. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic problems because its own 60 million Tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said today it is conducting a preliminary investigation of alleged financial fraud at an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that makes materials for nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said the probe was unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to launch on Thursday its own investigation of environmental controls and other operations at the Feed Materials Production Center, one of the key contributors to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production. The plant is situated at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, about 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, said in an interview that his department had not been notified of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe, which marks the third time in recent weeks that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have entered federal nuclear facilities. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which operates the plant under an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract, said he was unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> inquiry. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this week it was shutting down production indefinitely in order to focus more work on cleaning up the site's hazardous wastes. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> said the shutdown decision was unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said today the shutdown was temporary and would not interfere with normal weapons production schedules. He said the shutdown decision was made by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> alone and that he could not comment on how long it might last. <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing in contracting of the Fernald plant work. He declined to identify either the origin of the allegation, the date of its receipt by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or the specific nature of the alleged fraud. He also declined to say whether the charge was against an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> or another contractor at the site. `` It could concern any level of the whole contract process,'' he said, from the granting of contracts to their execution. <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said he was not sure whether the department had been informed of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation and had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said he believed it was the first such <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> inquiry at the Fernald plant, and added that the investigators had not yet determined whether a crime had been committed. He stressed that the inquiry had no connection to the plant's production facilities `` There's no physical danger involved; it involves paperwork,'' <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said. The plant processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear weapons production and makes uranium target elements for defense nuclear reactors. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in June raided an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> weapons production center in <LOCATION> Colorao </LOCATION> in search of evidence of criminal violations in the storage of hazardous wastes, and the bureau on July 6 opened a similar probe at a department facility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> states. <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said there was nothing to report on the department's own investigation at <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION>, which is focusing on health and safety measures, documentation, permits, planning and management He said it would last about a month and a half.

<HEAD>Trout Rescued From Ash-Tainted Creek; Fires Fought in Six States</HEAD>

 Rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six Western states, and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> fire that polluted a creek with ash forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in long-handled nets. Officials said 566 <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> trout were fished out of <LOCATION> Diamond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, put in containers on mules and horses, loaded onto trucks and brought to the Mescalero Fish Hatchery. The trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes ash-free. `` They were in good shape,'' said <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> range and wildlife staff officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Gila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive. Much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the lightning-caused Divide fire, which started June 30 and burned about 10,000 acres 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The fire was contained Monday and should be controlled within four days, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish, then netted them. When a fish is stunned, it comes to the surface. Gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in the <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> of southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but the habitat was ruined because of wood cutting, overgrazing and irrigation. The trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967. Lightning sparked three small fires Thursday and today, but firefighters were extinguishing them today, said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher in <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 1,500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher humidity Thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has charred more than 3,000 acres of scenic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastline near Big Sur. Firefighters said they were unable to make progress overnight. They hoped to have the 6-day-old fire contained by late today, but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper their efforts. A brush fire accidentally started by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at least 3,000 acres at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, a base spokesman said. Firefighters on Thursday said they had contained the 2,000-acre Livermore Fire west of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, the last of three major fires in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to be encircled by firefighters. Seven 20-person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to three crews, officials said. Earlier, firefighters contained the Black Tiger fire which covered 2,000 acres in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> and destroyed dozens of homes, and halted a 2,600-acre fire in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires, and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained. The stubborn <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> Fire, burning beneath the <LOCATION> Mogollon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>, had grown to 300 acres, but officials expected to have it contained by late Saturday. In northwest <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, members of a volunteer fire department and a few National Guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze that charred 48,000 acres of the Pine Ridge. The fire, which raged for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures, was contained Wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon. Forest officials in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> shifted their attention Thursday from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees. The blaze blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees, many of them 60 to 80 years old, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Fire Staff Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> hoped for rain. `` My experience is that we'd see green grass again if we get enough moisture, say a half-inch of rain,'' he said. Rains helped firefighters in western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> forests. The storms dampened a fire in <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> that had burned nearly 3,500 acres. `` It's been real quiet,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Heninger </PERSON>, a ranger in the forest's <LOCATION> Pinedale </LOCATION> office. `` It looks better all the time, the way these clouds are coming in.'' <PERSON> Heninger </PERSON> said four crews will probably be released from the fire today, leaving two to continue mop-up work. But one official with the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> warned the break in the fire season will probably be short-lived. `` As soon as it gets hot and dry again, we will be right back in it,'' said center spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. `` For now, anyway, we are getting some relief.''

<HEAD>Eight Civilians and Troops Killed in Shooting Outside Somali Mosque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Troops opened fire Friday on worshipers outside a mosque in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, the Somali capital, and state radio reported eight people were killed in what the government called religious disturbances. A resident said it appeared troops opened fire as Moslems left their place of prayer during <PERSON> Eid </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Adha </PERSON>, the three-day Feast of Sacrifice that is Islam's holiest celebration. The resident, who spoke on condition he not be identified further, said gunfire erupted around midday and continued sporadically through the afternoon. He said most of the shooting appeared to be around a mosque in a western neighborhood. The shootings come in a week of unconfirmed reports that authorities have detained several Moslem religious leaders. A Ministry of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> statement broadcast on state radio said a group of `` troublemakers masquerading behind the cloak of religion'' started the disturbances in <LOCATION> Hodhan </LOCATION> neighborhood. The report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, said security forces were called out to curb the disturbances but the `` troublemakers refused to disperse peacefully.'' Fighting broke out and eight people were killed and 24 were injured, according to the statement. The dead included `` troublemakers'' and members of the security forces, it said. The resident said the government imposed a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in the capital. He said he saw little activity during an afternoon drive through <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, except for two soldiers guarding an army post. `` However, people in the neighborhood say they've heard gunfire all around,'' he said. On Sunday, an unidentified gunman shot and killed <PERSON> Mogadishu </PERSON>'s Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON> It was not known whether Friday's disturbances were related. This East African nation on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> has been led since 1969 by the autocratic President <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who allows no opposition to his rule. It is difficult to get news from the country. Since 1981, the government has battled the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a northern insurgency that demands <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s removal. Intensified fighting between the rebels and the government the past 18 months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The impoverished nation is overwhelmingly pastoral and most of the 9 million people are Moslem.

Reached Thursday at the government relations firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gogol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, where she is executive vice president, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said it would be premature to comment.

<HEAD>Drug Chain Agrees To Stop Selling Cigarette Papers In Baltimore</HEAD>

 A group of ministers used a petition drive to get a drug store chain to pull cigarette rolling papers from shelves in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area and hopes to expand the ban to all stores in the chain. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> had asked Rite Aid to discontinue sales of the product in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> because it can be used to make marijuana cigarettes. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>, a Rite Aid spokesman at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the papers would be removed from about 80 stores. The chain has 2,281 stores in 22 Eastern states. `` No decision has been made with respect to the rest of the chain,'' he added. The Rev. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, national vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that the group will increase pressure on Rite Aid to stop selling the papers from all stores. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, president of the Baltimore chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, said the committee also has its sights on drug dealers' use of public telephones to conduct drug transactions on street corners and intends to seek telephone company assistance in investigating the practice.

 Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June, dragged down by falling auto and home furnishing purchases, the government reported Friday, and analysts said big-ticket items would continue to bear the brunt of the anti-inflation fight. `` The decline in sales reflects that people are getting a little cautious about spending their money,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, economic forecasting organization. `` That's partially because there's been a lot of talk about the risk of recession and people are taking that seriously,'' he explained. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, agreed, saying: `` The pocketbook has n't been zipped up completely, but it's closed to a considerable degree. <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, noted the sales decline was concentrated in the durable goods area and predicted the pattern would continue for the remainder of the year because of high interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that sales fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 140.8 billion last month after dropping 0.1 percent in May. It was the first back-to-back monthly decline since 1987 when sales declined 0.8 percent in September and 0.9 percent in October. Retail spending is watched closly as a measure of the overall economy since it accounts for about a third of economic activity. Car sales, which represent about 20 percent of total retail sales, led the overall decline last month. They fell 2.0 percent, following a 1.8 percent drop in May. It was the steepest fall since a 4.0 percent decline in October 1987. However, <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said auto sales have picked up since the June survey was taken. Some analysts said the latest retail sales report would provide the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> additional incentive to lower interest rates as it seeks a `` soft-landing,'' rather than drive the economy into a recession as it fights inflation. `` It's not a question of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will ease further,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's only a matter of when.'' Until recently, interest rates have risen as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightened its grip on credit to slow the economy and stem inflation. While rates have begun to fall, they are still high enough to affect spending on durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years. Durable goods sales were off 1.3 percent in June after falling 0.5 percent in May, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said. Besides autos, sales of furniture and other home furnishings were off 0.1 percent. Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent, including a 2.1 percent increase in department store and other general merchandise spending and a 1.9 percent hike in clothing sales. `` The one shining light will continue to be apparel,'' particularly women's clothing, said Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's the only area where there's pent-up demand,'' she said, following several years when women postponed purchases `` because they did n't like the style or whatever.'' Non-durable categories posting sales declines included food stores, down 0.7 percent; gasoline stations, down 0.5 percent; restaurants and bars, down 0.2 percent and drug stores, off 0.3 percent. Retail sales were up 5.3 percent from April through June, compared with the same period in 1988.

 Rival Moslem sects in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> fought over water and land rights, and one person was killed and 18 were wounded, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Thousands of people, some with guns, clashed Thursday night between the villages of <LOCATION> Vorukh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chorku </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Isfara </LOCATION> region, the traditional site of rivalries between Iranian-speaking and Turkic-speaking Moslems. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> first secretaries of the neighboring republics of <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> rushed to the scene to calm things down. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, ethnic tension continued to run high in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, according to reports reaching <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The violence continued as preparations continued for a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in late July on nationality problems that have erupted under the liberalizing reforms of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Authorities have not announced a date for the plenum. The latest violence in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> stems from an old dispute about land and water use at <LOCATION> Isfara </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Leninabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oblast </LOCATION> on the border between <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>. The border near the disputed area is jagged as authorities gerrymandered along ethnic lines when they carved the republics from the former Tsarist province of Turkestan in the 1920s. Cooperative use of an irrigation canal at <LOCATION> Isfara </LOCATION> ended at the beginning of this year when the disputing parties filled it with stones, `` causing substantial agricultural losses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The situation worsened the last three months as local authorities decided to build additional settlements in the area `` without undertaking the necessary consultations with residents'' on water and energy supplies, it said. In <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, capital of the <ORGANIZATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, Armenian residents circulated a photograph of an Armenian watchman killed at a livestock complex Wednesday night in the nearby town of Shush, said a worker at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> there. `` His throat was slit and his eyes were cut out,'' said the worker, an Armenian who declined to identify himself. Demonstrations began nearly two years ago in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to protest the administration of the enclave by the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> lies within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a predominately Moslem republic, but the majority are Armenian Christians. No one has been arrested for the most recent murder, although investigators have been sent to the region and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops have been patrolling all week, according to official reports. In the nearby republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the situation remained tense in the town of <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Beridze </PERSON> of the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Five people were hurt in a June 25 disturbance in <LOCATION> Marneuli </LOCATION>, but the exact nature of the problem has not been reported by the Soviet media.

 You are 5 years old. You are in the hospital and about to have surgery for bronchial complications when the child in the next bed offers this advice: `` Do n't cough during surgery or you'll die.'' It happened to <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> 30 years ago, and the memory of that moment lingered and sparked the first in a series of books aimed at helping kids 8 to 12 years old cope with uncomfortable situations. The books, `` Hospital Journal: A Kid's Guide to a Strange Place'' and `` Alone at Home: A Kid's Guide to Being in Charge,'' were published in June by Viking Penguin. `` There are plenty of story books already out on both of these situations, but sometimes telling a story just is n't enough, or it's too much,'' the author said in a recent interview Banks uses a workbook format which allows children to `` write things down, learn about them, and hopefully, gain control of the situation.'' Each year, she says, about 4 million children enter the hospital for an overnight stay. For many, it is their first hospital visit. Banks recalled that at age 5, she did n't know whether to believe her roommate's startling claim about the danger of coughing. `` But I sure remember being too afraid to ask anyone,'' she said. As a result, the hospital book includes a page titled `` Will It Hurt?'' and urges readers to ask their doctors and parents to describe exactly what will happen to them before, during and after surgery. The bood also includes sections on getting to know doctors and nurses, where children ask their medical people about their favorite television shows, their hobbies, and about why they chose their profession. `` This way they learn something personal about these people and hopefully feel more at ease around them,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. Banks talked to scores of teen-agers, doctors, nurses, guidance counselors and specialists. A section of the hospital book dealing with privacy -LRB- or, more accurately, the lack of it -RRB- grew from the interviews with teens. `` The kids talked a lot about how embarrassing it was when the nurse did n't close the curtain enough, or they had to be helped onto a bedpan ... the minute I heard it, I knew it was important to them.'' The result is a section called `` This is Embarrassing!'' which urges kids to talk about those indelicate times. Youngsters are encouraged to count the injections they receive; to ask new people they meet to autograph the book; to laugh at hospital jokes -LRB- `` What do you call a sick alligator? An illigator.'' -RRB- The second book, `` Alone at Home,'' asks children to list the locations of first-aid supplies; the phone numbers of working parents; and `` special people,'' neighbors who a child can turn to if problems arise. With more women working full-time, some experts estimate there are 6 million so-called latchkey kids who come home from school daily to empty houses. `` You tell a child you'll be home a certain time and then stop off at the grocery store or run some other errand that makes you 15 minutes late; those few extra minutes can seem like a very long time for a kid.'' Each book concludes with a parents' guide. Parents are asked to work with their kids in completing the workbooks _ rehearsing what they should do if they lose their keys, or if someone knocks at the door. Banks, who lives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and is the mother of 5-year-old <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, plans two more books for the series _ one on divorce and the other on living in stepfamilies.

<HEAD>Barry to Run for Re-Election in DC, Complicating Jackson's Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> disclosed plans to seek a new term Thursday, despite an 11-year administration punctuated by scandal, in a decision complicating the political future of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, 53, said through an aide that he will run for re-election in 1990 and expects <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support. The announcement ended months of speculation about whether a combination of personal woes and the city's crime and budget difficulties would discourage <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> from running for an unprecedented fourth term. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had disclosed plans earlier in the week to move to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Sept. 1. And he had done nothing to discourage speculation that he was eyeing the mayor's chair, although aides said he would not run against <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, an old ally from civil rights days. But the two-time Democratic presidential contender quickly pulled back after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> spread word of his plans, telling the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, `` I have no plans to run for mayor.'' `` I'll be doing more and more work out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the cause of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said of his political organization. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, also a Democrat, was traveling to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was en route from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and could not be reached. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in the newspaper interview, `` Our basic work, whether it's same-day -LRB- voter -RRB- registration, or day-care legislation, or our reinvestment plan, or affordable housing, is all kind of Washington-centered. It makes more sense for my wife and me to have a house there three or four days a week than to stay in a hotel.'' In the past six months, several of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s top appointees have resigned, a former top adviser has been indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, and the mayor himself has twice testified before a federal grand jury about ties to a man convicted of selling drugs in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. That man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, is awaiting trial _ recently postponed to September _ on additional drug charges in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He came under federal investigation after city police called off an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from him after learning <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was in <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel room. As for the mayor's race, one aide familiar with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s political strategy said the disclosure of his plans was designed to keep <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from gathering momentum in an unannounced campaign for mayor, particularly in the event that the drug trial produced more unfavorable publicity for the mayor. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been concerned that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moves to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is damaged by the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> trial, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> will gather a full head of steam and be unstoppable,'' said the aide. The mayor had planned to make his announcement in the fall, the aide said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has never held elective office, and a term as mayor was seen by some of his supporters as a way to add such experience to his political resume, while avoiding a third run for the Democratic presidential nomination at a time he seemed unlikely to win. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, in addition to his personal problems, is struggling with the city's murder rate and is having to deal with growing budget problems. Through Friday, 229 persons had been killed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1989, 70 more than at the same time last year. A record 372 persons were killed in the district in 1988, and police blame more than 60 percent of those deaths on drugs.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Doctors Embroiled in Dispute at Closed Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what government officials say is an unprecedented move, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is challenging the quality of medical care provided to dozens of injured workers at its now-closed assembly plant here and is refusing to pay for it. The care provided to workers by certain physicians in the <LOCATION> Kenosha-Racine </LOCATION> area was `` inappropriate, unreasonable and excessive,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON>, manager of workers' compensation for the automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has assured workers they wo n't be liable for unpaid bills, and says its battle is with the doctors, not with the workers treated. A former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> leader said the union approved of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision, but a lawyer who represents some <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers was critical of the move. `` I think that's a tactic of the auto industry and it's a blatant abuse of their employer-employee relations,'' said <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON>. `` They are potentially opening themselves up to substantial litigation.'' <PERSON> Gagliardi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to pay workers' compensation claims will only compound the pain of last year's plant closing, in which about 5,000 workers were laid off. <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is refusing to pay 200 bills and is challenging an additional 300 submitted since Dec. 1, 1988. He had no estimate of how many patients were involved, but one doctor estimated it at 80. The company began sending out letters to employees this week, he said. <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is not questioning the employees' injuries, only the care provided by certain physicians. All the cases involve on-the-job injuries or illnesses. <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said the automaker conducted an outside audit before determining that the medical bills were improper. The automaker is `` self-insured,'' meaning it pays medical bills directly rather than buying insurance. `` What we have is a pattern of bad practice and we feel a moral obligation to confront some of these bad practices ...,'' <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said. `` The dispute is between <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the doctors, and we're trying to keep the employees out of this. Employees have been told that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will pay the bills if it loses its challenge. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is also giving employees a list of suggested alternative doctors if they wish to leave the physician treating them, <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON>, a former leader of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72, said there have been rumors of poor medical care in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for a decade and the union is glad that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is finally investigating the allegations. `` I'm pleased that everybody will finally have their day in court. This type of thing has been going on in this community for the last 10 years,'' he said. He said he hoped the legal system would expose any doctors who are providing poor treatment and vindicate any physicians who have been unjustly tainted by rumors in the past. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulhaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, administrator of the workers' compensation division of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Human Relations, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s actions are precedent-setting because they challenge the reasonableness of care rather than just the cost `` There's an allegation of a tremendous amount of abuse and fraud,'' he said. <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> declined to identify the doctors whose treatment is being challenged. <PERSON> Faulhaber </PERSON> said he believed about nine doctors were involved. The Associated Press contacted several doctors in the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> area to see whether they had received payment from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. Most declined to comment or said they did not know the status of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> claims because they leave their financial matters to their staff. But Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanshepolsky </PERSON>, a neurosurgeon, said he has not received any payments for treatment he provided <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers over the last 18 months. <PERSON> Kanshepolsky </PERSON> said he has talked with other doctors and estimated <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has refused to pay the bills of at least 80 patients. He said most of the doctors have been too busy to complain. `` Doctors are poor business people. We're too busy rendering care sometimes to fight this,'' he said. <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to either present its information to an administrative law judge should an employee request a hearing or stage a legal battle should any doctors sue the automaker. `` If a doctor feels he disagrees with our refusal he can directly challenge us in court,'' <PERSON> Lewsley </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers are waiting in the hills, on the streets and in the fields for another enemy attack on this ancient city that is already in ruins. `` The opponents are definitely planning to attack <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> city, especially the airport,'' said the military governor of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Nurul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, a city of 300,000 people about 70 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border and 250 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, already has been bombed, and row after row of homes and stores are locked up. The city has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles in the decade-old war between the Soviet-backed government and the U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas. The guerrillas have been trying for more than 18 months to capture the city. Since May, the Afghan armed forces have been preparing for a major offensive by the guerrillas. Tanks manned by gunners are stationed throughout the city. Soldiers wait in wheat fields, their rocket launchers ready to fire. Members of the local militia pass through the streets, waving their <LOCATION> Kalikovs </LOCATION>, a short-barreled, high-velocity variant of the Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifle. On <PERSON> Koh-i-Mahi </PERSON>, a strategic peak once used by the guerrillas to launch an attack, swarms of government troops stand guard. Soviet and Afghan officials have accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the base of the main seven guerrilla groups, of massing 10,000 to 15,000 troops near the border to help the guerrillas, or mujahedeen -LRB- Islamic holy warriors -RRB-. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies the charge. `` We understand that this time the opponents will be aided in a big way by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said Thursday. He said the government had received information that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had massed 200 tanks and 40 fighter bombers at a base in the city of <LOCATION> Quetta </LOCATION>. `` We are holding our positions. But if we are attacked we will go after them and there will be massive bloodshed,'' he said. Capturing a city would give the guerrillas a base for the interim government they formed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in February. The guerrillas, who control most of the countryside, have been trying since early March to seize the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Although the guerrillas captured several key outposts around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in the early days of the assault, the government has held the city. Foreign defense experts in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> doubt the guerrillas have the manpower or the firepower to launch another major attack on an Afghan city, but President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s soldiers appear to be taking no chances. Even during the Moslem holiday of Eid al-Adha, security posts around the city remained alert. In anticipation of a renewed attack, the government has deployed fresh troops to <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and stationed MiG-21 fighter bombers at its airport, according to a senior Afghan army officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to disclose specific figures.

 <PERSON> Yusaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, sitting quietly Friday on the stairs in front of his tiny beachfront restaurant, sighed deeply and said, `` It looks like my summer is over.'' The 85-year-old restaurant owner was among hundreds of shop owners, hotel managers and restaurant operators in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, whose business has been hurt by thousands of earthquakes and the eruption of an undersea volcano. `` I have been running this place for over 40 years and business was never this bad,'' he said. Since June 30, more than 22,000 quakes have jolted the hot springs resort, including more than 585 strong enough to be felt by humans. Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakes registering 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> on Sunday. On Thursday evening, a volcano onthe ocean floor off <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> erupted, spewing white steam into the air. The hundreds of hotels in the area are virtually empty, although some of the rooms are being filled by reporters. `` The irony is that this town earned its fame from its rich hot springs derived from volcanic activity,'' said one middle-aged shop owner, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Now, the volcanic activity is hurting the tourism industry.'' More earthquakes and volcanic tremors jolted the Ito area on Friday, but no injuries were reported. Scores of dead fish and volcanic stones were scattered along the shore. `` On an ordinary Friday afternoon, this beach is always packed and most restaurants around here are full,'' said <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>. `` But I've only had one customer so far today. News reports Friday said two undersea mounds were found near the eruption site, a few miles from <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>. One was about 80 feet high and the other about 30 feet, the reports said. Most of the 200 people who left their seaside houses after the eruption to spend the night in four <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples and schools returned home Friday, but 43 schools in <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> remained closed, said <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuhashi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prediction </ORGANIZATION> said another eruption was highly likely to occur, not only at the same spot but possibly at other locations. When the 72,000 residents began to experience temblors in recent weeks, its 916 hotels and inns began receiving a stream of cancellations. After the eruption Thursday, more than 95 percent of hotel reservations were canceled, said <PERSON> Hiroyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> of <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s tourist bureau The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northern island of Hokkaido, erupted several times.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> on Friday applauded a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing small FM stations to double their signals and reach larger audiences. NAB President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said the group `` strongly endorsed'' Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> decision to allow many so-called Class A FM stations to boost their power from 3,000 watts to 6,000 watts. About 500 of the nation's 2,000 Class A FM stations, most of which serve small communities, could make the switch as early as Dec. 1 without causing interference problems for other stations. Another 800 or so stations will be able to apply for permission to change tower locations or to resolve other technical problems preventing an immediate power boost, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Friday. The remaining stations wo n't be able to change. `` We're very pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> authorized the doubling of power to many FM operations,'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said. `` Secondly, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> wisely recognized that general, across-the-board increases could do serious harm to the integrity of the FM spectrum. The commission's case-by-case consideration of additional power increase applications may alleviate any other interference problems that may be presented.'' The commission said the increased power would allow the stations to provide better service to their listeners. The commission also revised the distances by which Class A stations must be separated from other stations to limit interference. The current separation is 105 kilometers, or about 65 miles, while the new separation will be 115 kilometers, or about 71 miles, effective Oct. 2. `` The area covered will be 40 percent greater,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Class A FM stations are the most numerous of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s seven classes of FM stations and those that have the smallest service areas. The largest FM stations have signals with 100,000 watts or more. The commission said the small communities to which Class A channels were originally allotted have grown, while the coverage of these stations has remained unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he feared the new rule would exacerbate the commission's already backlogged application process, adding that he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would allocate additional funds to the agency to handle the expected glut.

 Wholesale prices fell in June for the first time in 18 months while retail sales recorded the first back-to-back monthly declines since the 1987 stock market plunge, the government said Friday in new evidence of a national economic slowdown. Prices one stop short of retail, as measured by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index, dropped 0.1 percent in June, driven down by tumbling energy and food costs. It was the first decline since December 1987. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June _ the first consecutive drop since September-October 1987 _ as spending remained sluggish for cars and other costly goods. In a third report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities fell from 83.8 percent in May to 83.5 percent last month, evidence that manufacturers are cutting back in response to consumer restraint. `` This is simply further confirmation of a clearcut slowing in the underlying pace of the economy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The handwriting is on the wall regarding inflation. We will see a slowing for the remainder of the year.'' But, the inflation report provided mixed signals to the stock and bond markets, where traders were uncertain whether the reports were weak enough to soon trigger another cut in interest rates by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> joked that it was a three-handed report. On one hand, the decline in the overall index was welcome news of a break in inflation. On the other hand, the so-called core inflation rate, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, jumped 0.7 percent, the biggest rise in nearly three years. But, on the third hand, most of the increase in the core rate was caused by an increase in prices for cigarettes and ships. `` In the end, what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is left with is a package of data which show a lackluster economy,'' he said. <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> and other analysts said the central bank, which has engineered two quarter-point drops in interest rates since early June, likely would push interest rates down another notch before the end of the month. `` It can happen anytime as far as I see it,'' he said. Another move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> likely would prompt the nation's banks to follow the lead of <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, which already has cut its prime rate, the benchmark for many adjustable-rate consumer loans, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> fought inflation by pushing interest rates higher from March 1988 through March 1989, but since reversed course as evidence of economic sluggishness mounted. The slight decline in wholesale prices last month followed a sharp jump of 0.9 percent in May and left the annual rate of inflation for the first six months of 1989 at 7.6 percent, nearly double last year's rise of 4 percent. Energy costs, which had soared more than 20 percent over the first five months of the year, fell 3.1 percent in June, the biggest drop in three years. Food prices fell 0.8 percent, the steepest in a year and a half, reversing an identical increase in May. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these details of prices in June: _ Tomato and celery costs, which had doubled in May because of unseasonably cool weather in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, fell sharply Vegetables overall fell 8 percent last month, following a 26.4 percent rise in May. _ Other food catagories posting declines were: pasta, 9 percent; fish, 7.3 percent; chickens, 5.2 percent, and beef and veal, 3.8 percent _ Prices rose for pork, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, fresh fruit, eggs and candy _ The energy decline included drops of 8 percent for fuel oil, 4 percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas _ Tobacco prices rose 5.8 percent _ Prices for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, soaps and furniture also rose, while prices for flatware, women's clothing, jewelry, glassware and cosmetics declined The overall June decline left the Producer Price Index for finished goods one stop short of retail at 114.1, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 114.10 last month, 10 cents less than in May but $ 6.40 more than a year ago. The news from inflation measures earlier in the production process was also good. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.2 percent in June after rising only 0.1 percent in May, while crude goods dropped 2.0 percent following a 0.9 percent rise. An example of the three processing stages would be finished _ bread; intermediate _ flour, and crude _ wheat.

 <LOCATION> PARIS </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s embattled prime minister, a part-time poet, spoke lyrically of brotherly love and the future in explaining his vision of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit. But beneath <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s soft words was his determination to overcome sex and money scandals and maintain his party's three-decade hold on power. The 66-year-old Uno, who took office only a month ago after the downfall of his predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, heralded his arrival in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the 15th annual economic summit with lavish promises of aid for poorer nations and the environment. To promote his plan, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> quickly threw himself into a series of bilateral meetings with leaders of countries both rich and poor, ranging from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave him a personal boost Friday by suggesting they treat each other on a first-name basis, saying `` close personal relations'' were important for their countries' ties, Japanese officials said. `` Thank you, <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said as he left a short bilateral meeting. At the meeting, the two leaders agreed to launch talks on removing trade barriers. The move gives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the opportunity to press <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to open its markets further to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods while satisfying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in removing such talks from the threat of retaliation posed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill. Japanese officials have spoken confidently here of the strengthened role their nation will take in future meetings. While <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been criticized for its excessive trade surpluses, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said, officials are now `` determined to be an active member of the summit and try to contribute as much as possible to the welfare and future growth and burden-sharing of the next seven years. `` -LRB- The aid proposals -RRB- are signs of determination on the part of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and Uno himself to try to contribute to the constructive discussion of the summit meetings.'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said that enroute to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, the author of three books of haiku poetry, told his spokesman he sees the summit as a forum for love for humanity through fighting terrorism and drugs, light for the future through economic growth and burden-sharing by helping nations in debt. Still, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since 1955, may be too deeply mired in problems at home to win total forgiveness from voters through deft summit work. Political analysts were predicting <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s party would lose its majority in the upper house of the Diet -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in elections on July 23 in the wake of an unpopular sales tax, a widespread influence-peddling scandal and allegations Uno kept paid mistresses, including a geisha. The allegations about <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> became widespread soon after he took over last month from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned as prime minister after accepting responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal that brought down three members of his Cabinet. Uncharacteristically for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where political wives are nearly anonymous, photos of Mrs. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and the Uno family were featured prominently in a press packet prepared for foreign reporters covering the summit. At the summit, Uno will pledge nearly $ 40 billion in new aid funds, including a $ 35 billion extension of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s program, which had been scheduled to end this year, to recycle its trade surpluses for the benefit of developing countries. Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> on Thursday, was `` very impressed'' with the aid figures, officials said. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s finance minister, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, welcomed the debt relief, which will be one of the discussion topics between the seven summiteers. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is in the position to take the lead role here,'' he told reporters. `` They are in the strongest position from the balance-of-payments standpoint.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also announced it will set aside $ 2.25 billion for projects to preserve the global environment, an area where it has recently been trying to change its longtime image as an abuser of resources.

 Three former Housing and Urban Development officials are trying to raise money for the legal expenses of another former agency official who is accused of steering <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to a developer in exchange for a bribe. A letter bearing the names of the three former officials, seeking $ 100 donations to the `` Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> has `` been victimized by the same machinery that has targeted other leaders nationwide.'' That is an apparent reference to investigations stemming from allegations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The three former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials are <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary for public and Indian housing and urban development, was indicted in May, accused of steering a $ 400,000 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contract to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> developer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON>. In return, the indictment alleged, <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> promised to increase the salary of <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>'s wife, who worked for a company <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> owned. The indictment said <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON>, who has close ties to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, also helped <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>'s wife obtain a $ 45,000 city contract. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> pleaded innocent and were released pending trial. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> was hired as a housing official by <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, shortly after he left <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, and a separate investigation is under way to determine whether there was any connection between that appointment and $ 28 million in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> received in the six preceding months. He was suspended from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> job after being indicted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As for the three men trying to raise money for him: _ <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former top aide to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, has been shown to be the owner or developer of six projects that received <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitation funds after he left the agency _ <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, who served as assistant secretary for community planning and development under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, was involved in approval of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project being pushed by a longtime <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> friend <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> left the government and joined a law firm that was involved in the development. _ <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> now works in housing management for a company based in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, is involved in a number of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> are listed on the letter as two of the five co-chairs of the fund; <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> is listed as its treasurer. Donors are asked to send donations to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank. `` We must pay more than lip service to this affront,'' the letter says in requesting $ 100 donations, which it says are being solicited in hopes of raising $ 100,000. `` One hundred dollars to assist a friend who has stood by us in our time of need is a small contribution when compared with the large contribution he had on making our programs successful.'' A copy of the letter obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> was sent to a housing official in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Among the subjects of congressional and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigations are allegations of influence peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> by former agency officials and prominent Republicans who served as consultants for developers of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects. The letter said <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> `` played a catalytic role'' in the success of public housing during his seven years at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. It praised him for, among other things, `` returning our calls and responding with quick answers,'' `` empowering his staff to assist us when help was needed,'' and `` testifying on our behalf at congressional committee hearings.'' Attempts to reach <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> for comment Friday were unsuccessful. A man answering the telephone at his <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home said <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> was not there. His attorney did not immediately return telephone messages.

 Mourners packed a small, 17th century church where eight coffins were lined up Friday beside mounds of flowers at a funeral for some of the 14 people killed in a farmer's shooting rampage `` It's not fair!'' one mourner cried over and over. Eight of those killed in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION>'s two-hour shooting spree Wednesday, including two children, were buried in a churchyard in the tiny village of <LOCATION> Verne </LOCATION>. Separate ceremonies for the six other victims were held in five other villages _ <LOCATION> Voillans </LOCATION>, Autechaux, <PERSON> Baumes-les-Dames </PERSON>, Athose and Grosbois Dornier was moved from a hospital in <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION>, the nearest large city, to the Fresne prison hospital near <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Friday and charged with murder and attempted murder, police said. He was recovering from wounds suffered in the shootout that ended the killings, which began with the deaths of Dornier's mother and sister. Witnesses said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON>, 31, then drove around the area shooting from his car window at everyone he saw. People from all over the region flocked to <LOCATION> Verne </LOCATION>, 1 -LCB- miles from <LOCATION> Luxiol </LOCATION>, for the main burial ceremony conducted by Monsignor <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Daloz </PERSON>, Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION>.

The government was represented by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyronne </PERSON>, governor of the <LOCATION> Doubs </LOCATION> department, who read a message from President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> expressing his `` sad condolences, sentiments of deep sympathy and compassion.'' Neighbors said <PERSON> Dornier </PERSON> had frightened them long before his two-hour shooting spree Wednesday. `` Christian was a taciturn, depressed fellow,'' said his brother, <PERSON> Serge </PERSON>, who lost his mother and newly married sister. `` He had no friends, hardly ever talked to anyone. A few weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut. He did strange things like that and we did not pay much attention.'' Ceremonies to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution on Friday were canceled throughout the area. Mourners filled the 17th century church and spilled into the square below where they followed the ceremony over loudspeakers. Cars were parked for a mile on both sides of the narrow roads leading into <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>. Among mourners was <ORGANIZATION> Luxiol </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>, who said Dornier `` was not always normal and coherent, but he had not committed any crimes and I had no basis to have him interned.'' <PERSON> Clausse </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, also was there. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> fired at Dornier early during the shooting spree, injuring him in the neck, but could not prevent the farmer killing his 5-year-old cousin, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON>. Dornier's father, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, 63, was recovering in the <LOCATION> Besancon </LOCATION> hospital following an operation for injuries he suffered in his son's shooting spree.

 Both the factory operating rate and industrial production fell last month, the government said Friday, providing more evidence of a slowing economy caused by anti-inflation measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the June operating rate declined to 83.5 percent, a 0.3 percentage point drop from May. The rate was 84.1 percent in April and hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also said industrial production was off 0.2 percent last month, with its industrial production index standing at 141.1 percent of its 1977 base, down from May's 141.4 percent. It was the first decline since it fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been the first drop in a year. `` It's really related to the consumer pulling back on autos and other durable goods that go with housing,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was that high interest rate environment that was really the major source of the weakness.'' Until recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates in an attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing economic growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday's reports `` are not indications of an emerging slide into recession.'' `` Rather, they should be viewed as the temporary softenss that is likely to be associated with a soft-landing scenario for the economy,'' he said. Analysts also saw the decline in the factory operating rate as further lessening of inflationary pressures. The closer that industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. `` The decline in capacity utilization _ which reflects increased capital investment as well as slower output growth _ provides additional confirmation that contrary to previous fears, the economy is not in danger of capacity shortages,'' <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said operating rates for iron, steel, paper and industrial chemicals are down. `` These are the industries that were so strong earlier and where a lot of the inflation was occurring,'' he said. The manufacturing plant operating rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 83.8 percent, down from May's 84.1 percent. Prior to April, the rate had declined since it peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, fell 0.3 percentage point from 82.7 percent in May. This reflected in large part a reduction in the production of cars. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods dropped to 85.8 percent, compared with May's 86.0 percent. Production remained flat at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods. Output at mines and oil wells fell 1.1 percent after a revised 0.3 percent decline in May. Production at utilities dropped 1.3 percent in June after a 0.2 percent drop in May. <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said output of energy materials should increase when coal strikes are settled. More than 30,000 coal miners have been on strike for over a month in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> also said warmer weather demands for electric power would result in increased utility production this summer. Last month's factory operating rate was up from 83 percent a year earlier. The industrial production index was 3.4 percent higher than a year ago.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says charges that three people made technical explosive devices for <ORGANIZATION> Provisional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> use against British targets show the `` high level of technical sophistication'' of world terrorism. The three, one of whom had top security clearance, were arrested in different states on federal charges of conspiring to injure and destroy the property of a foreign government. An arrest warrant was issued for a fourth person believed to be in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said the three were developing sophisticated circuits for use in remote-controlled explosive devices and the design and development of delivery systems for rockets. Sessions, noting the three have backgrounds in electrical engineering, said the arrests `` demonstrate the high level of technical sophistication being employed by terrorist organizations to further violence worldwide.'' The Provisional Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>, is an underground organization that has been fighting the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and police since the early 1970s trying to end British rule of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Arrested were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 27, a citizen of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who has been living since April in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. They were arrested in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, respectively. A federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, an Irish citizen linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>'s explosive research program. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunkenheimer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> apparently has returned to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was released on $ 10,000 bail Thursday and a hearing was set for Aug. 8 to move her to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the lead city for the case. At a hearing in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> agreed to be moved to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scuderi </PERSON> ordered him to be there for a hearing Monday morning. An affidavit signed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> details extensive phone taps, surveillance of conversations, the opening of mail and the inspection of luggage as part of the investigation. The affidavit was filed in federal courts in the three states where the arrests were made. Among the evidence cited in the affidavit was a May 27, 1989, conversation between <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> in <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s car in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Willington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The two are alleged to have discussed the kind of electronic jamming equipment British army troops had likely employed, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s progress with a fuse and <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>'s work on `` two computer programs intended to operate as the missile guidance system. They also `` discussed other methods of downing helicopters with high-bore machine guns and hyper-velocity missiles,'' the affidavit says. The document also details the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to obtain devices known as tone frequency switches, which are electronic encoders that allow radio commands to detonate explosives. The defendants are: _ Johnson: A recipient of electrical engineering degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> got secret security clearance in 1978 that was upgraded to top secret Aug. 22, 1986 In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he worked for <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Quigley </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> says in the affidavit he believes <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> is a PIRA technical expert In addition, he says he believes <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> called <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> last December `` to restore contact between the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> -LRB- previously broken off for security reasons -RRB- and to enlist <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s technical expertise in developing countermeasures against low-flying helicopters and aircraft.'' _ Reid: Currently employed by a <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firm the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would not identify, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> unsuccessfully tried recently to obtain employment at a major <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> aerospace defense firm, the affidavit says <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the political wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the affidavit says, and helped bring <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> together. _ Maguire: The affidavit cites <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities as saying <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON> has been involved in the <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION>'s explosives research program since the late 1970s He was arrested in 1981 by the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garda </LOCATION> along with six other <ORGANIZATION> PIRA </ORGANIZATION> members suspected of involvement in the manufacture of remote-control bombs, but was released for lack of evidence.

<HEAD>KGB Chief Confirmed, But Told to Stop Spying on Soviets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Friday to let the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief keep his job, but they told him to stop spying on ordinary citizens and laughed in disbelief when he insisted the agency does n't tap telephones. It was the first time a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief had stood up in public to justify the actions of the secretive intelligence agency, which is blamed for killing millions during <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule. Political reforms gave the Supreme Soviet the power to reject Cabinet-level appointees, and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> as saying Thursday's questioning was the most difficult examination of his life. But in the end, only six of the 542 deputies in the Supreme Soviet voted against his confirmation. Twenty-six deputies abstained. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> has been <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chairman since last year and was deputy chairman for 10 years before that. Deputies submitted written questions, and <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> read them himself, reducing the stinging tone. `` By what right do you tap people's telephones?'' asked one legislator. Derisive snorts of laughter greeted <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>'s answer that the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> does not bug telephones of Soviet citizens. Maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told Western reporters during a break he did not believe it. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, which performs both domestic and foreign security functions, `` strictly follows Soviet laws'' and has only a few `` helpers'' who inform on neighbors and colleagues. He said 30 Western spies have been captured in the last three years. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in a speech later that there were agents in every Soviet institution, doing great moral damage with their snooping. But he said that during the 10 years he was <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION>, the agents `` never caught a single spy.'' <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>, a professor and reform leader from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, told deputies that many students have told her they were offered money within the past year to inform on other students and teachers. The balding, spectacled <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> responded to questions at rapid-fire speed but provided few real answers. He refused to reveal the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s budget despite repeated inquiries but said it would be published soon. He also refused to say how many employees the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> has, but he said its border guard contingent alone numbers 200,000. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> does not maintain dossiers on any dissidents except those who present a threat to the state. He did disclose that he was personally involved in starting the controversial investigation of a pair of popular prosecutors, who claim they ran into trouble when their investigation of corruption reached into the ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said he thought of the prosecutors _ <LOCATION> Telman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gdlyan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> _ as `` legends'' when he became <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chairman but that within a week, his staff suggested they were guilty of coercing confessions. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said he alerted the chief prosecutor and they found substance to the allegations. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> also admitted the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> should have done a better job dealing with recent ethnic rioting in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, where about 100 people died. He held out the possibility the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> could join <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police network in the West. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> chaired the session and tried to cut off debate several times, but the deputies refused. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joined the discussion only once, to agree that the new <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> building in the city of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION> was too grandiose. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that when he saw the imposing edifice, he suggested the local <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> move back to its old quarters. <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> later said that secrecy must exist. `` If we tell everything about what we are doing, then we will probably weaken ourselves and strengthen those whom we must _ unfortunately from time to time _ try to counter,'' he told the evening TV news program `` Vremya.'' `` I think in this matter, my colleagues from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries probably agree with me,'' he said.

 They were n't celebrating Bastille Day in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. As a matter of fact, some folks would n't have known what to celebrate. `` No, I was n't made known of it,'' said <PERSON> Brack </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON>, who lives at the only intersection in this southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Assmann </PERSON>, the native West German who runs the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Crossing Market a few miles down the road, had some idea about <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Independence Day. `` I know what that is because in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, they got the Bastille. That's a prison, is n't it? It had something to do with the revolution, did n't it?'' <PERSON> Assmann </PERSON> said. World leaders were gathered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, for Friday's 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The July 14, 1789, takeover of the prison and symbol of oppression under <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XVI </PERSON> galvanized a spirit of freedom and marked the start of the French Revolution. That does n't get much notice in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, however, where questions about what was being done to mark the occasion drew blank stares. By noon Friday, not even a television camera had showed up to mark the day. It was much the same story for Parisians in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who also largely shrugged off the holiday. `` Do what? Bastille Day? Not that I know of,'' said City Clerk <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhineheart </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Ark. `` It's too bad we do n't have a celebration for the Bastille Day,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toland </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which as it happens is named for a fellow named <PERSON> Perris </PERSON>. `` But we're a Mormon community and this year is the 100th anniversary of our tabernacle.'' A bit more was planned in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which became slightly famous when an arty movie was made with that name some years back. They planned a community spaghetti dinner and a production of `` Macbeth'' Friday night, as well as a French-style bicycle race on Saturday. Why <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> and spaghetti? Spaghetti because it's full of carbohydrates for the bicyclists, and `` Macbeth'' because the community theater season happened to include that play for July 14, said <PERSON> Mal </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an organizer of the weekend's events. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, with a population of 25 or 30, is about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> -LRB- pronounced ver-SAYLES -RRB-. It was once a thriving community but now is just a clump of houses overshadowed by its neighbor to the west, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Crossing, or, as it is known locally, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. How did <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, get its name? If anyone would know, it probably would be <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Deputy </PERSON>, 92, a former schoolteacher who lives with her sister, <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, 98, a few doors down from the store. `` I asked my mother the same thing, and she was 87 when I asked her, and she could n't tell,'' Miss Deputy said. `` But her family came from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.'' No one in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> can speak French, residents say, nor can any recall anyone ever visiting their European namesake. But a few years ago, a group of French Parisians came to the <LOCATION> Jennings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town. `` Some time back they came, some fellows from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and they was visiting all the places named <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, taking pictures and getting some history,'' <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> has a proud history. Back in the'20s _ the 1820s _ it received the votes of two delegates in the election to choose a new state capital. -LRB- <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> won. -RRB- Its tailors were famous for their suits, and men that wore them turned heads when they ventured into nearby Madison. People would say, `` There's a man with a suit from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON> says. But <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' fate was sealed when it was bypassed by the railroad. Now, from <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON>'s front yard, you can see only about a dozen homes and as many outbuildings. Across the street is an empty lot with lawn ornaments. `` There was a grocery store here where that deer is, and it caught fire,'' <PERSON> Feltner </PERSON> said. Now, if you want groceries, the nearest place to buy them is <PERSON> Assmann </PERSON>'s store, a little ways down the highway in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where about 200 people reside. <PERSON> Assmann </PERSON> said he knew of no ceremonies that would mark Bastille Day in the community. `` But do n't let that fool you,'' he said. `` These quiet towns, they can get rattled up.''

 In the fringes of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summitry, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are playing out old rivalries, sniping about everything from the significance of the French Revolution to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s right-wing policies. Amid the greetings, the banquets and the parades marking the celebration of the revolution's 200th anniversary and the start of the summit of the seven major industrialized democracies, the British-French exchanges are becoming increasingly less fraternal. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> began the latest spat, telling <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that the overthrow of the French monarchy did not initiate the concept of human rights: <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with the 1215 <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carta </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the 1776 Declaration of Independence did that long before _ and without a bloody reign of terror. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s socialist premier, came back sharply Friday, saying in an interview here with British television that while he admired <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s democratic traditions, the conservative Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s policies were heading toward `` social cruelty.'' `` I am _ and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is well aware of the fact _ concerned about the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government's trend toward social cruelty, which I fear may damage the relationship between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s different social classes and regions and in time possibly even the very quality of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s political democracy,'' said <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>. As news of his interview broke here, a British spokesman produced figures contrasting the <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate of 6.3 percent, down from 10.2 percent in 1987, with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 10 percent, scarcely changed from two years ago. `` They've really made very little progress since 1987,'' said the British spokesman, requesting anonymity. Asked how Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> felt about <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s remarks, he added coolly, `` I'm not even sure she is aware of them.'' Before arriving Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> that through <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s history `` <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> imposed its will on the monarchy,'' which continues to flourish in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is also putting a damper on French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s attempts to turn the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit into a dialogue between the rich countries and some 30 Third World heads of government he invited to the bicentennial celebration. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> responded warmly to a call by four Third World countries for a North-South conference on ways to help debtor countries handle crippling burdens. British officials immediately told reporters that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> saw no need for such a conference, or any new initiative, and that commercial banks and debtor nations should get on and settle the problems under initiatives already agreed to. Asked about the atmosphere between <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who clashed last month about European monetary union at a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit, the British spokesman replied simply, `` Very good.'' When Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> arrived for the start of the bicentennial celebration, she was greeted by boos, mingled with applause, from the watching crowd of Parisians. British officials shrugged this off. `` Sounds just like home,'' quipped one. But <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, now well ahead of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s party in the polls, accused her of making an `` eccentric spectacle'' of herself with her `` offensive'' comments about the French revolution. In a statement in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs spokesman, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, said he wondered if she `` has gone mad.'' `` Such conduct is, of course, extremely offensive to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> people, who are taking part in an historic national celebration,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` It is even more worrying for the British people ... who now watch with incredulity as the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister makes an eccentric spectacle of herself in front of the world,'' added <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` I can only conclude that Mrs. <PERSON> Tahtcher </PERSON> sees herself as a 20th century <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> who, faced with the justified complaint of the electorate she misrule, airily replies: ` Let them eat pate'.''

 An <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> prison official said Friday that although it took two tries to execute a convicted killer in the electric chair, the first jolt of electricity rendered him unconscious. The botched execution of <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ with the first failed try apparently caused by a faulty cable hookup _ is likely to refuel arguments by death penalty opponents that the electric chair is `` cruel and unusual punishment.'' A 1983 execution that took three jolts of electricity led to a federal court challenge. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' attorney called the drawn-out electrocution a `` grisly scene.'' The state prison commissioner called it `` human error.'' <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>, 28, a mildly retarded man, was executed for the 1980 slaying of a woman who was raped and stabbed 66 times while tied to a tree. The first throw of the switch at 12:08 a.m. brought no response from the 5-foot-11 man, whose face was covered by a black veil attached to the electrodes on his head. Two doctors who examined <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> determined he was unconscious but had a strong heartbeat, Prison Commissioner <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said at a news conference later. A guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber and told another guard directing the execution, `` I believe you've got the jacks on wrong. `` They're torturing him,'' <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>' attorney, death penalty opponent <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, said softly to a fellow witness. Officials fixed the problem and threw the switch again at 12:17 a.m., delivering 2,100 volts to <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>. He was declared dead 10 minutes later. `` I regret very, very much what happened,'' <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said. `` It was human error. I just hope he was not conscious and did not suffer.'' <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said later Friday that electrical current did reach <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> body on the first surge. `` It rendered him unconscious,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Of the faulty connection, he said, `` Through our procedures of checking the equipment each day, somehow, someway, it got reversed, and we are right now correcting the problem.'' Officials said they did n't know how much voltage was in the first charge. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> law allows application of electricity to the condemned until the prisoner is dead. In 1983, three jolts of 1,900 volts were required to kill murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, prompting criticism from death penalty foes that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was `` burned alive.'' Officials said two extra jolts were required because an electrode came off <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' leg in the first charge. The incident led to a federal court challenge, but the courts ruled the use of the chair was constitutional. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> was convicted of capital murder in 1981 in the rape and slaying of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, 26, of Warrior, a mother of four children who were asleep in the house as she was assaulted and killed outside. Her husband, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, found her body tied to the tree when he returned home from work. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> described <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON>, 19 at the time of the crime, as an illiterate when the killing occurred but who taught himself to read and write during his eight years on death row. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> deserved execution. `` It's taken so long. It ought to be over.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused Thursday to block the execution. <PERSON> Dunkins </PERSON> became the 115th person executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the fifth in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to reinstate capital punishment in 1976.

<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientist said Friday the possibility of global warming from the so-called greenhouse effect `` is too much of a risk to ignore.'' Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, who oversees science and education programs, said he has named <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> as his special assistant for global change issues. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> has been deputy administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was evidence that global warming has already begun,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` A conclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of global warming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too much of a risk to ignore.'' Gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, nitrogen oxides and halons, he said in a statement. Some of the gases also seem to be causing a thinning of the high-level ozone layer, which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays which can limite the growth of sensitive crops. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> will coordinate activities among seven <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies and the land-grant universities as part of the department's efforts to protect crops and forests, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. Department studies, some dating back to the 1950s, have shown `` substantial damage to crops and forests from atmospheric pollutants, including low-level ozone,'' he said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists represent the department on the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed last November in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 An American rabbi and six students today occupied a Roman Catholic monastery on the edge of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> to demand its nuns leave, but men working at the convent beat the protesters and dragged them out. About 20 people including uniformed and plainclothes police watched as the workers came out of the convent and asaulted the protesters, who called the convent a `` desecration'' of the Jews killed at the Nazi concentration camp. Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said his group suffered bruises, scrapes, bleeding noses and lips. Their signs were destroyed, their clothes were torn, and they were forced to leave the convent grounds. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said that the nuns watched from the window of the convent and did not move to stop the workers. `` It's extraordinary that 50 years later, something like this could happen,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` I demand an apology from these nuns.'' The incident occurred five hours after the protesters climbed a seven-foot wrought-iron fence and occupied the monastery. The facility is located in a former Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945, an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews. When he occupied the monastery, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the group would stay until the end of the Sabbath, Saturday night. It was the second time the workers confronted <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and the students. Earlier today, workers on the second floor of the convent doused the protesters with water, jeered and told the men to leave. The workers began manhandling the protesters and trying to expel them, but the workers returned to the convent when police officers outside the convent gate shouted at them to stop. It was not clear why the police did nothing the second time the workers attacked the protesters, who wore yarmulkes, draped prayer shawls over their shoulders and held lighted candles. `` How dare you throw water at a rabbi or any Jew here at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>! Shame, shame, shame on you!'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> shouted at the workers. He spoke English, but the workers and nuns spoke only Polish. `` I saw when they -LRB- workers -RRB- came to us. I saw the vengeance in their eyes. We want our dead respected,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. The protest brought out strong emotions of hurt, anger and hatred among several dozen Poles who passed by the convent during the day and began to argue with the group. `` This is our <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. What are you doing here?'' one middle-aged woman said to the group. `` They -LRB- the group -RRB- should think about Palestinian Arabs,'' said another man, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Wron </PERSON>. `` It's a kind of rape because the sisters are innocent.''. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> tried to talk to the passersby but he could n't speak their language. The cloister was founded in 1984 in a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> storehouse on the perimeter of the former death camp. The lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where political prisoners were gunned down by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> executioners in 1940 and 1941. A 1987 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> declaration, signed by 18 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders, called for the transfer of the 14 Barefoot Carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built at an undetermined site farther from the camp. The international controversy surrounding the convent has become even more emotional since the deadline for moving the nuns passed Feb. 22. In May, 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in front of the convent. `` Do n't darken the memory. This convent is a desecration of the 6 million,'' said a sign held by today's protesters, referring to the estimated 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said his group is demanding the `` convent be removed, the cross dismantled, and the nuns leave.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> is responsible for arranging the transfer of the convent. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said that despite the church promise to move the convent by February, it appeared the nuns were refurbishing the building and grounds. `` Our patience has run out,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` We're here to stay,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>' students

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoon <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who with brother <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> is fighting <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> claims that they owe $ 1 billion in taxes and interest, won a partial victory in one of the cases Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sided with <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, on a key issue in a case involving millions of dollars worth of transfers they made to cover their children's losses on investments in silver. The court held that transfers of money made through March 14, 1980, when silver prices were still rising, were loans that the Hunts could write off as bad debts after the children were unable to repay them. Payments to the children after that date were gifts on which the Hunts must pay taxes, Judge <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parr </PERSON> ruled. The judge held that the Hunts' children, to the extent they had any net worth remaining at the end of 1980, are liable for income taxes on the value of their forgiven debts to the parents. In addition to the Hunts, the case involved son <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>; daughters <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Curnes </PERSON> and sons-in-law <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curnes </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was seeking more than $ 1.75 million in 1980 income tax and gift tax in the cases, the bulk of it from the elder Hunts. The court decision did not indicate how much the brothers and their children would owe as a result of the ruling. `` I'm not really as familiar with it as I'd like to be so I ca n't comment on it,'' <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said when asked about the ruling The trial of a separate case involving 1982 taxes and penalties sought from Bunker and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> is continuing in <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The central issue is a partnership and the value of assets that the Hunts used to cover their debts when the silver market plunged. A Hunt cousin testified Friday that a precious-metals dealer threatened to make the entire <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> family suffer unless Bunker and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> repaid $ 434 million in debt from the March 27, 1980, silver price collapse. Cousin <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told of a meeting with <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, then chairman and president of New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> Engelhard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> three days after the price plunge. `` Mr. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said the three individuals must pay or the rest of the family must suffer,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Korner </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in a non-jury trial in which Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> are contesting about $ 300 million in 1982 taxes, while brother <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> is contesting $ 500,000. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, youngest of the three brothers, did not owe <ORGANIZATION> Engelhard </ORGANIZATION>. He said he told <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> that the brothers would be ready to go into bankruptcy to protect the family's other assets. `` Once he said the family must suffer I took it to mean every Hunt company, every Hunt, every individual had to share in payment,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` I felt it was a threat.'' According to <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Engelhard </ORGANIZATION> officials and the brothers met with a group of bankers in an unsuccessful effort to get a loan. Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> ultimately settled their <ORGANIZATION> Engelhard </ORGANIZATION> debt with silver and a 20 percent interest in their <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil and gas interests. To settle remaining silver debts, the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> borrowed $ 1.1 billion and put $ 824 million of it into a partnership with the brothers. They added gold stocks and silver and coal properties, which the government contends are worth far less that the Hunts' estimates. The case decided by the court Friday indicated the net worth of the Hunt children was tied directly to the price of silver, in which they, with money from their parents, had heavily invested. At the end of 1979, the combined net worth of the three children -LRB- a fourth was not involved in the case -RRB- and two spouses was $ 76 million. In less than a month, at the silver peak, they were worth a combined $ 163 million. They were wiped out in the price collapse, chiefly because their investment was in contracts for future purchases, whose price fluctuations were limited. In the first five months of 1980, <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> transferred more than $ 150 million to the children to help them make margin calls in the silver market or to take delivery of silver. Late in 1980, <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> formally demanded that the children turn over all their assets except their homes to settle the debts. He wrote off as tax-deductible bad debt the portion of the loans exceeding the children's assets.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 32 years until losing power to a new generation of reformers, was buried Friday and praised as an early advocate of change. Thousands of people attended the somber state ceremony, which culminated two days of emotional tribute to the 77-year-old leader who died July 6, 14 months after his ouster. `` His great merit was to become a reformer in an age of rigidity,'' said President <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Straub </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s cautious support of economic reforms in the late 1960s and early 1970s Party chairman <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the architect of pioneering economic reforms in the late 1960s, said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s name `` has become inseparable from the Hungarian cause and international progress.'' Neither speaker alluded to the criticism of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> that followed his ouster as party leader in May 1988. Thousands of Hungarians lined the streets as the black Mercedes hearst carrying <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s body slowly made its way from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building in downtown <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kerepesi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, where top-level communist officials are traditionally interred. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rule began amid the bloodshed of the 1956 anti-Stalinist revolt as Soviet troops and tanks entered <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to quell the uprising. It ended 32 years later, when party leaders increasingly viewed him as an obstacle to change. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s body lay in state for two days in the gallery of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building, and officials said more than 60,000 people had come to pay their respects. `` These people were not just saying goodbye,'' deputy party spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON> said. `` They came to express their thanks for the last 30 years.'' <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as party general secretary in the changes that swept reformers into top party ranks, said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s death `` closed a major era of our history. `` We pay our respects in a worthwhile manner if we sincerely and objectively face ... the lessons of the age marked by his name,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said in a eulogy at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Hungarian TV carried live coverage of the funeral. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was stigmatized for helping the Soviets crush the 1956 revolt and blamed for economic stagnation after his cautious reforms stalled in the 1970s, but many Hungarians credit him with guiding <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to relative prosperity. `` My parents always taught me that until 1975, they had a good life and that it was due to <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Attila </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, 27, was quoted as saying in the Hungarian daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>. A man in his early 30s told Hungarian TV: `` I know that he led the country to a catastrophic situation, but I'm convinced that he always had the best of intentions.'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> gained respect at home and abroad for his cautious economic reforms and policy of relative tolerance of dissent. But as the reforms stalled and the nation's foreign debt mounted, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> became increasingly at odds with younger reformers pressing for bolder change. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was named honorary party chairman after he lost the top party post to <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, but one year later he was removed from that post. He also was stripped of his membership in the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which criticized him for mistakes during his rule. It was under <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rule that the 1956 uprising was officially dubbed a counterrevolution and its leader, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, was executed. The Communist Party recently re-evaluated the uprising as a popular revolt, and <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> was rehabilitated. His remains were reburied in an elaborate ceremony June 16 that was attended by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians. Only hours after <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s death, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> innocent of all charges.

 POINTE-A-PITRE, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indians </LOCATION> celebrated Bastille Day with parades and a cultural festival featuring hundreds of artists, dancers and singers from 15 Caribbean nations. Guadeloupean independence activist <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinette </PERSON> was greeted by a crowd of about 500 cheering supporters late Thursday night as he stepped off a plane from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Reinette and seven other Guadeloupean nationalists jailed since the early 1980s on charges of terrorism were granted amnesty Wednesday by the French government, a gesture aimed at coinciding with the bicentennial of the French Revolution. Local television and radio broadcast the Bastille Day celebrations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Thursday and Friday. Bicentennial revelers in Pointe-a-Pitre watched <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> air force Mirage jets that flew from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this week perform low-level acrobatics, leaving trails of blue, white and red smoke, the colors of the French flag. Thousands of army conscripts marched in parades in Pointe-a-Pitre and <LOCATION> Basse-Terre </LOCATION>, the two largest cities of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Fort-de-France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>. As overseas departments, the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands of <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, each with a population of 340,000, are integral parts of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The theme of the Guadeloupean Arts Festival was the bicentennial of the French Revolution, symbolized by the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille prison by a Parisian mob. Several policemen accompanied Reinette on the flight, and more than a hundred were at the airport to prevent disorder when the independence leader arrived. <PERSON> Reinette </PERSON> was also greeted by his parents, wife, and two children. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> should not think it is off the hook by freeing us,'' <PERSON> Reinette </PERSON> told the crowd at Le Raizet International Airport. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> must initiate a veritable dialogue.''

 A bomb exploded Friday on a roadside in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing one militiaman of the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and wounding two others, police said. The explosion occurred in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone. Police said Israeli and SLA artillery batteries retaliated by shelling guerrilla bases of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in three villages north of the zone. Two villagers were reported wounded. The targeted villages were identified as <LOCATION> Arabsalim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jarjou </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumman </PERSON>, all strongholds of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia, a police spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The explosion occurred in the afternoon on a road leading from the security zone to <PERSON> Arabsalim </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the 6 - to 10-mile-wide zone as protection from guerrilla attacks after it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 Israeli forces and the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> patrol the zone.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for investigating <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> groups opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, saying the agency should purge its files. The panel said in an 150-page report that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983-85 probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and other groups was based on `` allegations that should not have been considered credible.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> files contain information about domestic political activities that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should never have gathered,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and Vice Chairman Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION> `` That information must be removed from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> records so it can not be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons,'' they said. A class-action lawsuit seeking the removal of the files is pending in federal court in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said there was no evidence the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tried to influence the probe, which eventually involved all 59 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices and included spin-off investigations of 2,370 people and 1,330 groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, political director of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, called the investigation politically motivated. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wanted to stifle domestic opposition to its policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, particularly the unjust wars in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, however, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> call for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to remove the case records from its files. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 19 that his internal probe of the agency revealed `` a lack of managerial controls'' in the case. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials had no immediate comment, but the report said that Sessions had disciplined six employees. The report, which did n't say what disciplinary action was taken, said Sessions had identified most of the problems that contributed to the mistakes made in the case. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, was head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> when the investigation began in June 1981 when Salvadoran expatriate <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON> infiltrated the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office of the solidarity committee. The report labeled <PERSON> Varelli </PERSON>, the son of a former Salvadoran interior minister and national police chief, as an unreliable source. The spin-off investigations, according to the report, raise questions about the lengths the government should go in probing political organizations, and should be considered in revisions of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and Justice Department policies. The report has been sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The solidarity committee's contention that the investigation was politically motivated is bolstered by a 1983 memorandum from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> office. The memo was included in the report. `` It is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack against <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and specifically against individuals ... who defiantly display their contempt for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by making speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political asylum,'' the memo said in part. The memorandum surfaced during a Freedom of Information inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based non-profit legal office, which filed the class-action lawsuit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supplied more than $ 3 billion in aid to the Salvadoran government since 1981. About $ 300 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has gone to the Contras, who have been at war with the Nicaraguan government.

<HEAD>British Library Problem: Too Many Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British Library is the nation's repository of printed books collected for more than 300 years, but it now is wrestling with a revolutionary idea: being choosy. `` We have 16 million books and we are chockablock,'' says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the chief executive. `` So many new books are appearing that we no longer have the space to keep every one. The problem is: what do we throw out?'' he said in an interview Friday. Librarians everywhere face it. And what is considered of no importance now will be just what's wanted in the next century. In the 19th century, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> _ the foundation of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> _ threw away the advertisements at the back of the weekly serial parts of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' novels before binding them. Now, social historians study the ads and the complete weekly parts are more valuable than first editions of the novels. `` It's an awful dilemma when you think what future generations will say about us, and I feel nobody is going to be satisfied,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, an American in charge of acquisitions, processing and cataloguing at the British Library. `` Time and circumstances change the point of view. If we had been around in the 16th century, we might not have kept -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s plays because he was outside the academic establishment,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Jenison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The British Library is one of the greatest in the world, formed in 1973 from books in the British Museum. Its treasures range from the <ORGANIZATION> Lindisfarne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospels </ORGANIZATION> written by a monk about 698 to original scores of the Beatles pop group in the 1960s. A $ 65 million library is being constructed and will open in 1993 next to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pancras </LOCATION> train station. `` If we move to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pancras </ORGANIZATION> all the books in the museum and 17 other buildings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where we store our books, we would be full up right away, so we must do something now,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The library commissioned a report on the problem from its own and outside experts who found no alternative to becoming more selective. Their report pointed out a loophole in the 1911 Copyright Act, which had been an asset but now is a burden. In that year, the British Museum acquired all the books which, from the year 1600, publishers had to deposit with the Stationers' Livery Guild The 1911 act required publishers to do the same for five other copyright libraries, in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, which was part of the British Empire in 1911. The report said the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> is bound under the law to receive all books, but not to keep them. `` We can not anyway,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` We have 300 miles of crowded shelves and we need 8 miles of shelving on which to put each year's new books. Last year, there were 300,000 British publications _ 62,000 books as well as newspapers, pamphlets and even local railway timetables and leaflets,'' he said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said first solutions may include sharing with the other copyright libraries so they hold different books. `` We may keep only one title by authors of myriad romantic and Western novels, refuse reprints if there are no textual changes from original editions, reject obscure works written on word processors for limited circulation, store rarely requested material outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and dispose of duplicates,'' he said. `` We have the same problem, too,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, information officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We thought we were in good shape when we moved into the largest library building in the world in 1981 but we will be out of space in 1992. We are discussing all sorts of solutions, giving some attention to priority and looking for space for 3 million books and serials in secondary storage,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has 550 miles of shelves and receives 31,000 items a day, of which it keeps 7,000. There are 14.6 million books among the 88,350,534 items in the library. `` Goodness knows who counted them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Bathing in the slime-covered waters along <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coast poses no health risk, but it is probably best not to swim in the algae, government health experts said Friday `` The sea is dirty but it is not dangerous,'' said Professor <PERSON> Alessandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguissola </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The floating algae appeared along the coast last week and hotel operators in the <LOCATION> Friuli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Veneto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Romagna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marche </PERSON> regions say tourists are canceling reservations. <PERSON> Anguissola </PERSON> said tests confirmed the algae was n't toxic and there was no need to ban swimming. But later in the day, the council released a document recommending against swimming in algae `` for reasons of prudence and hygiene.'' <PERSON> Anguissola </PERSON> reiterated the government's earlier warning against swimming in the algae for those with open wounds or cuts. He said the algae has flourished in warm, still water. When it rots, tiny gas bubbles carry the slime to the surface. The Federation of Italian Hotel and Tour Operators predicted that tourist losses this summer due to the algae could total nearly $ 200 million.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government has made notable shifts in policy recently, particularly concerning imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, foreign affairs secretary for the guerrilla organization, said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> would not oppose a negotiated solution to end race segregation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but that it does not believe the government is committed to peace talks. `` Nothing, really, of any seriousness has been said or done to convince us that the other side has in fact opted for a political solution of this matter,'' <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said at the outlawed organization's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> He said F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, designated to succeed South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, has not addressed the main conditions the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has stipulated for opening talks: _ The release of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> and all other political prisoners; _ The legalization of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other outlawed organizations; _ Ending the state of emergency; _ Withdrawing South African soldiers from black townships; and _ The return of exiles. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> made no comment on a July 5 meeting between <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is to retire in September. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has said the meeting had no meaning, but has been silent since <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> issued a statement saying he and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> discussed peaceful development for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> said there were notable shifts in South African policy. He noted the government no longer requires that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> formally renounce violence before it will consider freeing him from his life prison term. `` To that extent, one could talk about new thinking,'' said <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Govan </PERSON>, was convicted with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government. The elder <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was released from his life term in 1987 but is banned from speaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown without police permission. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> acknowledged his organization's insistence on the five pre-conditions was not `` new thinking.'' `` It is, though, a readiness on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to find such a political solution, if the conditions are there.'' Otherwise, he said, `` We need to continue the struggle, escalate the pressures. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was due to meet Saturday with a delegation from the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which is fighting its first South African election campaign in September. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million black majority has no vote in national politics, which are dominated by the 5 million white minority.

<HEAD>U.S. Won't Send Delegation to Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided against sending a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to make sure that Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> remains committed to holding elections among Palestinian Arabs, the White House announced Friday. The decision, relayed by presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, represents an easing of pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was taken after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> consulted with key aides. `` We are not sending anyone to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at this time, although it might be necessary at some later point ... to discuss the election proposal,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> for the economic summit meeting. He added, `` <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> feels we do not need to do that now.'' The decision reverses tentative plans by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to send a mid-level delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> next week. There, the officials were to meet with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> about the hard-line position taken by the prime minister and the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party at a convention in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> two weeks ago. Under pressure from hardliners, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ruled out a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state or relinquishing any of the territory <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> holds on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had also said that Palestinians living in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would not be permitted to participate in the elections and that balloting would begin only after violence in the territories ceased. Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also is opposed to the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, he was sharply critical Thursday of the stand taken by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. Flying here for a seven-nation economic summit, the president said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy against new Jewish settlements on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> had not changed. `` I understand the political pressures,'' he said of the development in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` But I ca n't be varying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy every day to accommodate political change.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that he would not send a high-level emissary, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mid-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would be dispatched. Among those known to be included was <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a key aideto <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> who plays a leading role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, a top aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said, `` The Americans did not want to be seen as though they are interfering in the internal affairs of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with regards to this mini-crisis.'' The center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said it may pull out of a governing coalition with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc over <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s hard-line stance For his part, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonds </ORGANIZATION> drive that `` if they -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- want to send some delegation, some envoys, we will always welcome them.''

 A BBC-TV crew left <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> Friday on orders from the government, which has imposed strict censorship amid ethnic violence and a dispute about the pullout of Indian peacekeeping troops. Reports reaching <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said the five <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> staffers were expelled, but a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said `` expelled'' was too strong a word. `` We were asked to leave,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They are the first journalists ordered to leave <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government imposed censorship July 6. Correspondent <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Adie </PERSON>, who arrived in the Sri Lankan capital of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Sunday, and four others were asked to leave Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` We have n't had an explicit explanation from <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>, but we assume it has to do with the state of emergency,'' the spokesman added. He said picture editor <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Crombie </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Wednesday and his equipment was later confiscated. The spokesman identified the other crew members as producer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Groom </PERSON>, cameraman <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thirer </PERSON> and soundman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio reporter based in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> remains. The Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> sent a message to <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> expressing concern. `` We consider your government's action violates internationally recognized standards of press freedom,'' institute director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Galliner </PERSON> said in a message published in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>. Under <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s censorship rules, all local and foreign correspondents are supposed to submit news and photo dispatches to a government censor. The censor has ordered deletions that include details of political assassinations and public remarks by Cabinet ministers. More than 12,500 people have died in ethnic violence that started in 1983 with an insurrection by guerrillas from the Tamil minority against the Sinhalese majority. A 1987 Indian-sponsored peace accord, under which Indian peacekeeping troops were dispatched to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, has failed to end the violence. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has demanded the 45,000 Indian soldiers withdraw by July 29, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it can not leave until the peace pact is fully implemented.

 The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, which usually prefers to wage its battles in the courtroom and the statehouse, is taking to the streets to fight a series of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings curtailing civil rights laws. Leaders of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, which usually takes a quiet, behind-the-scenes approach, are angered by what they see as a judicial threat to 35 years of gains for black Americans. For most of five days, delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People's 80th annual convention gave a polite and often enthusiastic hearing to a parade of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet members <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> pledged their devotion to civil rights, condemned racism and vowed to work to end the economic and social disparities between blacks and whites. But the mood shifted dramatically as the five-day gathering drew to a close Thursday. Executive Director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, comparing the high court's conservative majority to the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, called for a `` silent march'' on the nation's capital Aug. 26. `` We're not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn us around any more than we'll let white robes turn us around,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said, referring to the garb traditionally worn by Klan members. The convention also suspended its rules Thursday to condemn the high court and call for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reverse the rulings. One <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> leader explained the contrast between the warm welcome for administration officials and the sharp attack on Republican policies and GOP-appointed judges. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> is non-partisan,'' said <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cothran </PERSON>, a professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and president of the group's <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION> chapter. `` It is only natural that we would hear people from both sides.'' <PERSON> Cothran </PERSON> said he remains skeptical of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` Gosh, we enjoyed hearing -LRB- Housing and Urban Development Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> saying, ` Stop exploiting poor people, stop discrimination against minority group members in housing,''' he said. `` We wait to see to what extent his department will live up to those words.'' The closing-day fireworks Thursday began with an address by <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, former chairwoman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said blacks should give up on the `` Reaganized'' federal courts and put the heat on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president. `` To <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, we say, ` We're glad you're not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but that's not enough,''' she told the delegates. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> challenged the notion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> differs fundamentally from his predecessor on civil rights. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> laid the tracks ... to take the rights of workers and women and African-Americans and Hispanics and the poor,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in the closing address Thursday night. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is putting grease on those tracks, not brakes.'' `` I believe it's time,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` that we tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, -LRB- national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and the rest of those Republicans, ` It's time to put up or shut up.''' After listening to five days of speeches, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said the words from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> officials left her hopeful _ but cautious. `` We think that this will be better than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for minority people, at least we hope it is, anyway,'' <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said. `` But it remains to be seen. You can get up there and say anything.''

<HEAD>Negotiators Reach Tentative Agreement on S&amp;L Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional negotiators, breaking a procedural deadlock, tentatively agreed Friday to toughen proposed regulations on savings and loans as part of a $ 157 billion taxpayer bailout of the industry. Although nothing was adopted, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees moved toward embracing a combination of the toughest specific capital requirements in separate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bills to make S & amp; Ls back up loans with more of their own money. The conferees are trying to meld some of the most stringent features of both bills aimed at reforming S & amp; L abuses into one legislative package acceptable to both houses. Lax laws and accounting practices that let some thrifts lend federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent ventures while risking no money of their own is widely blamed as the chief factor behind the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, the largest financial debacle since the Depression. Covering the estimated $ 100 billion in losses is expected to cost each of the nation's taxpayers between $ 500 and $ 1,500 over the next 30 years. Differences in the way the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have approached the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation flared Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offered a comprehensive package and asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to counter with an all-encompassing proposal of its own. `` Except for financing, we're not very far apart,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican senator in the conference. `` To go through them one-by-one, we might be here past Labor Day.'' The chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferee, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, balked, calling the move a `` horrendous injustice'' to an earlier agreement to tackle one-by-one each of the hundreds of differences between the two bills. But after examining a rough outline of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal overnight, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said Friday that the two sides were `` so close on an overwhelming majority'' that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would try to put together a counteroffer Monday. `` ` My intention is to provide a starting point for an overall settlement,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators. `` I believe this provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse.'' Later Friday, however, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees balked at <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s suggestion to accept a Senate-proposed timetable that would make S & amp; Ls meet the toughest of the new capital requirements immediately upon the bill's enactment rather than in June 1990, as in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill `` We have to have some minimal amount of time before the regulations are issued,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of the most vehement supporters of making S & amp; L owners put more of their own money at risk. As passed in its original form, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would not have imposed the new requirements until June 1991. That issue, like dozens of others, remained unresolved. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he was optimistic that the two sides can iron out their major differences by Wednesday, with the possible exception for how to raise the immediate $ 50 billion cost of the bailout. To prevent the bailout from swelling the federal deficit, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> want to use 30-year bonds to raise the money needed immediately to cover industry losses of federally insured deposits. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, citing potential interest cost savings of $ 4.5 billion over the next three years, wants to borrow the money directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, a move that would increase the annual deficits for fiscal 1990, 1991 and 1992 by a total of $ 44 billion.

<HEAD>Olivier's Family and Friends Say Farewell With Shakespeare's Words</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHURST, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Far from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage where <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> became the most celebrated actor of his time, family and friends said farewell Friday with the flowers and words of the Shakespeare he loved. The casket was surmounted with a floral crown from his family made of elder and yarrow, studded with flowers and herbs mentioned in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s works: lavender, savory, marjoram, marigold, violets, oxlips, lilies, pansies, fennel, columbine, rue and daisies. `` Goodnight Sweet Prince. And flights of Angels wing thee to thy rest.'' The words spoken by <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> in `` Hamlet,'' written on one of the many floral tributes, summed up the nation's feeling for the honored actor. The funeral of Lord <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, who died Tuesday at age 82, was a small, private service. About 60 mourners gathered in the 12th century <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> beside a quiet country lane near his home in <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of the capital. A single bell tolled as the heavy oak coffin was lifted from the hearse. His widow, actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON>, turned away briefly and wiped tears from her eyes as she stood silently with his four children and friends. Beside the casket in the church was <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s battered red leather prayer book, given to him by his mother when he was a child. Among those attending the 30-minute service were several of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s closest friends from his profession: <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON>, Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zefferelli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, widow of Sir <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who recently played King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Olivier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, paid the final tribute by reading the closing six lines from the <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> play, one of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s most famous roles: `` I have a journey, sir, shortly to go; `` My master calls me, I must not say no. `` The weight of this sad time we must obey; `` Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. `` The oldest hath borne most: we that are young `` Shall never see so much, nor live so long.'' The service began with one of <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s favorite hymns, `` The King of Love My Shepherd Is.'' It was sung last year at the christening of his grandson, Troilus. <PERSON> Tarquin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s son from his first marriage, to <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Esmond </PERSON>, read the first lesson from the Book of <LOCATION> Ecclesiastes </LOCATION>: `` Let us now praise famous men.'' His 27-year-old son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, from his marriage to Miss <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON>, gave the second reading from the First Book of <LOCATION> Corinthians </LOCATION>: `` Death, where is thy sting?'' Prayers were led by the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> and the mourners joined in singing the final hymn, `` God Be In My Head.'' After the service, Miss <PERSON> Plowright </PERSON> got into a limousine with her two daughters, <PERSON> Tamsin </PERSON>, 23, and Julie-Kate, 21, and the mourners drove across the <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Downs </LOCATION> for a private cremation service at <LOCATION> Findon </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Worthing </LOCATION>. The family asked that anyone wishing to honor Lord <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>'s memory make a donation to the Actors' Benevolent Fund or cancer research, or `` that trees should be planted to enrich and restore the countryside. A public memorial service in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is planned, but the date has not been announced.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, trying to knock down the last hurdles to its new Third World debt strategy, has promised to arrange as much as $ 2 billion in loans for financially strapped <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, burdened by a whopping $ 100 billion in foreign debt, urgently needs help. `` Mexico,'' he told French television, `` is on the edge of an explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of carrying the burden.'' `` No one,'' he said, `` has an interest in this explosion taking place, which would mean more misery for a suffering people.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the test case of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's approach for easing the $ 1.3 trillion debt of poor nations. The strategy, representing a marked shift in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been holding intense negotiations with private banks to reach an accord to show off at the annual economic summit of the world's seven big democracies, which got under way Friday. But Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said it was unclear when <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and private bankers would wind up their bargaining, which began in mid-April. `` Whether or not the negotiations will proceed far enough to have closure by this weekend, we do n't know. We did n't set any deadlines,'' he told a news conference. `` But they're in good shape.'' The summit, he said, `` would be a suitable event to have that arrangement announced while we were here.'' White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> emphasized earlier, however, that `` the quality of the solution is more important that the timetable.'' The unrelieved debt problem was high on the summit agenda of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They were expected to discuss it in detail Saturday. The summit began at the same time that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was marking the 200th anniversary of its revolution, a celebration that has attracted some three-dozen leaders of the world's richest and poorest nations. The poor have taken the opportunity to lobby their wealthier counterparts for help. But it was highly unlikely the rich democracies would respond with any dramatic proposal. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chancellor of the exchequer, said, `` What is important is we have agreed -LRB- on -RRB- this extension of the debt strategy,'' referring to the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan. `` And the commerical banks need to be absolutely clear there is no new initiative coming forward,'' he said. `` That is the position, and it is up to them to negotiate a debt-reduction agreement with the debtor countries, starting with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a hastily arranged meeting Friday morning with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> to discuss the debt issues. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> met earlier in the week with German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> to press his case. White House officials confirmed reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to arrange a $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion bridge loan to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> meet its financial obligations until a final debt deal is in place. `` We would be willing to do this with other countries if <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the their banks can get together,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` We have indications that other -LRB- industrialized nations -RRB- would be willing to join as well.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has received similar loans from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past to help it close the gap between its financial obligations and the amount of money left in its coffers. A bridge loan helps sweeten a deal because it ensures bankers the debtor nation will continue making interest payments. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which is believed to be running low on foreign reserves, is the developing world's second largest debtor after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes private lenders $ 54 billion, with about $ 15 billion due American banks. In its negotiations with a 15-member bank panel, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has pressed for sharp cuts in both its overall debt and its annual interest fees, which run about $ 10 billion a year. By reducing those charges, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government would have more money left from foreign earnings to pump into its flat economy. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to cut its annual interest fees from 6 percent of its gross domestic product, the total value of a nation's economic output, to 2 percent. It went into the talks demanding a 55 percent discount on a portion of its $ 54 billion private debt. Bankers countered with a 22 percent discount. The two sides, sources said, have tentatively centered on a 35 percent cut. To do that, negotiators are discussing a variety of options, including swapping old debt for new, guaranteed bonds, and putting up new loans to dilute the debt concentration.

<TEXT>
 A onetime Housing and Urban Development official Friday contradicted former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s sworn statement that he had no direct role in approving financing for agency projects <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, former assistant secretary for housing at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, testified under oath that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> instructed her to approve more than $ 15 million for a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, project being pushed by a former law partner of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` I want the project funded,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> as saying. She offered her account in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>, one of three congressional panels investigating the burgeoning <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said she told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> she could not approve his request because career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees were `` violently opposed'' to it. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, said she felt she was `` acting on the approval of my boss'' when she did approve the project in 1985. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said department procedure required that she `` formally sign the funding documents.'' But she said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s signature was already on the documents approving funding for the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> project, which involved the conversion of a hosiery mill into apartments. `` After the secretary had given the approval I was implementing his instructions,'' said <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. Whether <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> actually signed the documents referred to by Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> was not clear. Other witnesses have said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant, often used an electronic `` autopen'' to affix <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s signature to agency documents. As a result of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s approval, the developers received more than $ 11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $ 2.3 million <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> and more than $ 3 million in tax credits, said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee In May, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told the subcommittee he set up a three-person panel at the agency to make funding decisions for the moderate rehabilitation program, one of the programs involved in the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> project. However, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he maintained final authority over the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> committee's decisions. `` I did not plan however to get into the decision-making process of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing so,'' he said. Efforts by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to reach <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for comment Friday were unsuccessful. `` The factual noose seems to be tightening around <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s neck,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to influence any project and we have two people making it very clear that he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` I want to give him every opportunity to clarify the apparent contradictions,'' said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> He said the committee would seek to recall <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes a recess on Aug 4. In response to a question from <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> also contradicted a statement Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> gave to investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office during an interview for their audit of the moderate rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> served on the internal panel. `` I did not serve on a committee and I did n't know it existed,'' she said. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said she deferred signing three waivers in the spring of 1985 that would qualify the <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> project for federal aid, even though she was directed to approve them by <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. She said she was uneasy about the directive because of unanimous opposition to the project from department professionals, and sought a personal meeting with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said she spoke to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> about having a meeting but that one never took place. She said among her questions were concerns about possible toxic waste at the mill site. She said other department aides assured her there was no evidence of such waste at the site, but she said she was never shown any documentation. Lants read from a memo dated Sept. 24, 1984 _ a year earlier _ noting complaints from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> field staff members that they had been pressured by the central office not to mention environmental problems at the site. `` I was told the secretary wanted it. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> asked me to sign the waivers. I was told to sign them, and I did,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> testified. The panel also questioned the pair about another troubled <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> entity _ the coinsurance mortgage program. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> testified that <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest private lender that underwrote mortgages in the $ 5 billion program, was removed from administrative probation despite concerns about the company among <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> professionals. The company now is under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. She said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had been placed on hold because of infractions of department rules, and former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> met with her in late 1984 or early 1985 to get the restrictions lifted. `` It was not a convincing argument,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said, and the restrictions were left in place. `` It was later brought to my attention that <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> had ... taken the case to secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. I was informed by staff that there was a meeting,'' and <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION>'s probation was lifted, she said. Citing one DRG project, <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which was approved on Sept. 11, 1984 after the mortgage company's probation was lifted, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said the project went `` belly up.'' DRG had coinsured a loan of $ 47.2 million for the project which sold for $ 8.9 million. Under the program, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is liable for about 80 percent of any defaults. Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday.

 Seven senior officials have resigned or been replaced in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s scandal-struck <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> after the execution of four military officers for drug-smuggling, an official Cuban report said Friday. The deputy interior minister, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, asked to step down Thursday `` in view of the irregularities that occurred in this institution by a group of officers, activities that went unpunished for 2 -LCB- years,'' said the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Romarico </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotomayor </PERSON>, chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and a substitute member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The scandal has shaken President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government, embarrassing him and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. For years, he had denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations his nation was being used for drug shipments, saying the reports were a plot to tarnish the revolution. The officers were executed at dawn Thursday after a trial that the government widely publicized. The Cuban news agency did not say exactly when the seven <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials were replaced, but it did indicate they left after the executions. Also blamed for failing to stop the smuggling, German <PERSON> Barreiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Carames </PERSON> resigned and was replaced by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutino </PERSON> as chief of intelligence at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the news agency reported. It added that both <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barreiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Carames </PERSON> `` will be employed in other tasks,'' but it gave no details. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> fired the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON>, on June 26 for failing to detect the smuggling ring, official media have said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Colome </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON>, his replacement, was installed with orders from <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to `` take measures that make a repetition of these deficiencies impossible.'' <PERSON> Colome </PERSON>, 50, is <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s third-ranking officer after <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his brother, Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Colome </PERSON> has been a member of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since 1965 and of the Politburo since 1980. <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> was fired shortly after the drug scandal broke with the arrest of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, once a trusted aide to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and a hero of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military expeditions to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, was one of the four executed officers. In addition to the deputy minister and the intelligence chief, five other senior officers have left the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the shakeup reported Friday by <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>. Those who resigned were identified as <PERSON> Amado </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, chief of border guards; <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermejo </PERSON> <PERSON> Labrada </PERSON>, chief of the forest fires department; and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Veliz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, deputy chiefs of the Ministry's political section. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caso </PERSON> was fired as chief of immigration, the news agency said. Their replacements were not given. Ten other officers, including one woman, were imprisoned in connection with the scandal and are serving prison sentences from 10 to 30 years long. All worked in a secret section at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> involved in an effort to circumvent an economic embargo imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s communist government in 1963. A court-martial convicted them of smuggling cocaine and other contraband for their own profit.

 The captain of a Greek tanker who already faced federal pollution charges after the ship ran aground off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, spilling thousands of gallons of oil, on Friday was indicted on two state felony counts. <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> was charged with failure to have a harbor pilot on board the World Prodigy at the time of the June 23 spill and with polluting the coastal waters, Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says about 300,000 gallons of toxic No. 2 heating oil spilled into <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> at the entrance to <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Most of the oil, which was lighter than the crude oil that has fouled <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> waters since March, has now been cleaned up or dissipated. The failure to have a pilot on board carries a potential penalty of $ 10,000 and one year in jail, <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. The pollution count carries up to 30 days in jail and a $ 10,000 fine. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, however, indicated that <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, was unlikely to spend time in jail, even if convicted. `` What we're looking at here are fines right now,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the ship is being repaired, likely will surrender to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> authorities within the next week to 10 days for arraignment, <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said. The attorney general said <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON>, had indicated the captain would cooperate. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> also faces federal counts of violating the Clean Water Act and the Refuse Act, which prohibit dumping of pollutants. He has admitted making a mistake and steering the ship in the wrong direction onto the reef, according to Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials who have interviewed him. A statewide grand jury began meeting in the week after the accident and the indictments were expected. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> refused to testify in front of the grand jury or a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the grounding, citing his right not to be forced to incriminate himself. The indictment charges that <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> ran the World Prodigy onto the rocks through `` gross negligence.'' The ship's helmsman testified during the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> inquiry that he spotted a red buoy warning of the reef on the left side of the ship, when it should have been on the right, as the World Prodigy approached the harbor but he did not tell the captain. The harbor pilot who was supposed to meet the tanker said he tried to warn it away from the rocks three times but saw no response. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said most of his office's efforts were going to recovering the costs of the spill from the ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the costs at almost $ 2 million, but <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said the state costs were not fully tallied. The attorney general said <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and its insurance company so far had cooperated in the assessment of damages. `` We're fortunate they're insured. We're fortunate they have an owner who seems to have some social conscience,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Fareh </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> is among thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers enmeshed in the Israeli judicial system because of stone-throwing, and could be sent to prison for 20 years. Miss <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a 14-year-old American citizen who lives in this Palestinian village north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, is accused along with three friends of `` acting with intention to endanger public life'' by throwing rocks at an intercity bus in December. She was 13 at the time, and says they were innocent bystanders. `` We were walking home from school and saw the bus stop,'' she said in an interview. `` Jewish people got out and started shooting in the air. We were scared and ran away, but they caught us and hit us and said we threw the stones.'' <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON>, the Israeli chief prosecutor, said no one was hurt but the glass in the rear door of the bus was broken and the passengers were endangered. `` We are pursuing the case because we take stone-throwing very seriously,'' he said. `` I do n't wish anybody to be in such an attack. You are helpless. If you're driving, it can be very dangerous.'' More than 1,500 Israeli soldiers and civilians have been injured, nearly all by stones, since the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began more than 19 months ago. At least 560 Palestinians and 35 Israelis have been killed, mainly by gunfire or means other than stones, and more than 8,000 Palestinians have been wounded. <PERSON> Hasson </PERSON> said conviction on the charge against the girls carries a maximum of 20 years, but the average jail sentence has been about 15 months. <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulos </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the case could drag on for months because of overloaded court calendars. `` I think this is symptomatic of the insanity of the Israeli judicial system,'' he said. `` They are trying to teach the girls a lesson and deter them and others from having a part in the uprising. This is n't the way to influence people.'' Miss <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said interrogators slapped her and threatened to put her in jail if she refused to confess. Before being sent home, she and her mother, <PERSON> Jamileh </PERSON>, had to sign a statement agreeing to an automatic three-month prison sentence if <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> was detained for another alleged offense. Apparently because she was only 13 at the time her arrest, authorities allowed Miss Awad to return to her ninth grade class at the Holy Rosary School. Her Palestinian companions, aged 15 and 16, were held for several months in a makeshift detention center in a convent, then put under house arrest. <PERSON> Ola </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> never lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but her father worked in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> until his death in 1983. She is among 16 holders of American passports who have been caught up in the judicial system since the uprising began. According to the army, nearly 8,600 Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are in detention in cases related to the uprising, most of them involving stone-throwing. About 7,000 Palestinian-Americans are among the 1 million Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials estimate. About 100 holders of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports are among the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s 700,000 residents. The Americans in detention include <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Samad </PERSON>, 16, born in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. He was sentenced in June to 10 months in jail after conviction on charges of erecting road barriers. Cases are pending against <PERSON> Usama </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazmi </PERSON>, 17, formerly of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, for allegedly throwing stones at soldiers, and <PERSON> Suzane </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nijmeh </PERSON>, 16, formerly of <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, accused of participating in an anti-Israeli demonstration. Palestinian-Americans do not get special treatment. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a consulate officer, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials visit the detainees but do not intervene in judicial proceedings. `` Our primary interest is seeing that they are treated humanely and equitably,'' she said. `` We have to respect the legal systems.'' The <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> believes this is not enough, and said in a statement: `` Lack of effective action by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will invite further Israeli violations of the rights of American nationals of Palestinian origin.'' It has taken up the case of <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON>, 25, a Palestinian-American who was detained without charge May 28 and is being interrogated in an Israeli prison on suspicion of anti-Israeli activities. <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON>, an accounting student at the <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION>, returned to his village of <PERSON> Kufr </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> in April to renew his identity card. He must have the card, issued by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to return to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. His lawyer, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, accused government interrogators of depriving <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> of food and sleep, forcing him to stand with a sack over his head, and handcuffing him in uncomfortable positions. `` I do n't know of any country in the world where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen can be held for so long and interrogated so roughly without any charges,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Principal Sacrifices Job For Students</HEAD>

 A principal who told officials that students needed teachers more than they needed him at his financially pressed elementary school of 200 was out of a job Friday. Some board members had tears in their eyes Thursday night when they voted unanimously to lay off <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON>. His teachers wept openly. `` This was the shortest and saddest meeting in our history,'' said board member <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Slowick </PERSON>. `` No one seemed to believe it would really happen, but me, `` <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON>, a teacher for 37 years, said by telephone Friday. `` But with the governor's announcement of further state aid cuts, there was no way.'' Hours before the school committee met, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced he was vetoing $ 491 million in state spending, including cuts in community and education aid, because of the state's own fiscal problems. `` He is a public servant, a teacher, who stood up to be counted and put his own personal welfare behind what is best for the kids,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, deputy state education commissioner. `` Our hearts go out to the parents, kids, teachers and the school committee, who had to make a very difficult decision.'' `` I did n't want to go. I still have one child in college,'' said <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON>, as friends and distraught parents rallied around him and several school superintendents called with job offers. `` But what would you do with the children without teachers?'' Maintaining the children needed the teachers more, <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> suggested last month that <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> could save about $ 40,000 by firing him and paying a teacher an extra $ 3,000 to run the school. `` Building faculty is the hardest thing to do,'' he said at the time. `` If we lose our teachers, we will never get them back.'' `` The irony is we had built an award-winning school,'' <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said. Last year, the school was cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> was named a fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and commissioned by the education department to conduct a study of the future of education. `` Educators in several states are using my monograph to plan their programs for the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said. `` And here I am looking for a job.'' A professional Shakespearian company also spent 12 weeks in residence at the school under a state Arts Council grant. A student-built nature trail, illustrated with the children's own poetry, was created with the help of a poet and a master calligrapher, who brought their art into the classrooms. `` I think the thing that makes me the angriest is the hypocrisy of saying that education is the key to our future at the same time we are unwilling to give the children the resources to cope with a legacy of $ 2 trillion in debt, a polluted environment and other social problems,'' <PERSON> Najimy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Endorses Stealth Production</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committee gave a strong endorsement Friday to production of the B-2 stealth bomber and approved <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s proposal to end production of the F-14D fighter jet. But the committee, in its $ 305 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill, voted to keep alive the controversial V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, inviting <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to change his mind about canceling the program. Committee chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the senior Republican on the panel, said the final bill was approved At a news conference, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expressed strong support for the B-2 program. But <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he had `` sticker shock'' from the high costs of producing the bomber. `` If that plane does n't fly, the debate's over,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` It's far too expensive to be a stealth taxi.'' The plane designed to evade Soviet radar has yet to fly, but the first test could come as soon as Saturday. The plane has been undergoing runway testing this week in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The committee voted to increase spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative by $ 800 million next year, to $ 4.5 billion, which is still $ 366 million below the administration request. `` We expect to be severely challenged on the floor on that,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The committee also: _ Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increases in flight pay and medical benefits _ Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> military nuclear facilities Members approved $ 1.8 billion, $ 418 million above the administration request. Additional money would also be provided for research on new clean-up techniques. _ Included $ 100 million for research on the proposed aerospace plane which would take off and land like a regular jet but fly at great speeds in the upper atmosphere _ Provided $ 30 million for developing lighter and better infantry weapons The B-2 is considered the most expensive plane in history. With development costs added, each will cost between $ 500 million and $ 650 million, and the military intends to buy 132 over the next few years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee trimmed $ 300 million from the administration's $ 4.7 billion request for the B-2 program next year and included in its bill a series of testing requirements before the plane could go into full production. Then, the cost of each plane must be held to $ 295 million after development costs, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The jet, if successful, could force the Soviets to totally revamp their air defense system at a cost far exceeding the B-2 price tag, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The decision to cut the F-14D was a tough one, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding that he felt obligated to back <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> in his effort to control defense spending. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee overruled both <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and its own chairman, voting to authorize production of the newest version of the F-14D. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said there was similar sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, but `` the two of us stood there like a stone wall.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee also approved <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s request to end several other weapons programs, including production of the F15-E fighter after fiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile, the M88 tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine. The exception came when the committee voted to keep alive the Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter then flies like an airplane. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is backing the program, but <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> decided to cancel it. The committee bill would complete development of the aircraft but not begin production. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the committee `` is hopeful'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would find a way to justify production of the plane.

 Heavy rains, landslides and floods have killed 814 people in the southwestern <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> this month, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The reports said the rains, which began July 7, have also led to 3,000 injuries and damaged more than 1.5 million acres of farmland. It said 420,000 houses, 825 miles of irrigation canals and 85 miles of dikes had been damaged. Most of the casualties were around Chungking, a densely populated city on the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nanchong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION> to the north. The death toll was expected to rise because 180 people remained unaccounted for, and were presumed lost, after a landslide buried a residential compound in <LOCATION> Nanchong </LOCATION> on Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. It said 41 bodies had been recovered from the debris and 17 people rescued. Flood officials said the rains and flooding were the worst to hit <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, a perennial location for natural disasters, in the past eight years. More than 100 deaths from flooding have been reported in coastal areas, and other provinces along the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> have been warned to prepare for heavy flooding.

 Coal miners in one Siberian city ended a four-day strike Friday, but work stoppages spread to at least seven other cities in the region, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official news agency said miners had added political demands to the original issues of better food and working conditions. Miners in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, where the strike began Monday night, went back to work for the Friday night shift, the official news agency said. The workers' leaders and management had reached a settlement on Thursday. A settlement was reached Friday evening in the city of <LOCATION> Osinika </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, but did not give further details. Strikes also were reported in <LOCATION> Prokopevski </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Novokuznetsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kisilevsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lenin-Kuznetsk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berezovski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemerov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported late Friday night. Early reports said about 12,000 men struck <PERSON> Mezhdurechensk </PERSON>'s five mines and that there were walkouts in 10 cities; later reports only mentioned eight cities and did not say how many miners were involved outside <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>. No violence was reported in the strikes. Before returning to work, the miners in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> held rallies outside their pits Friday night to demand that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders visit the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> region, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the strike committee in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, a city of 110,000 people about 1,600 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, also demanded that a new national constitution be adopted by next year. Explaining the men's dissatisfaction, miner <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatsenko </PERSON> said in an interview with the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>: `` We were told for years, ` Put out more coal and do n't worry about anything. We'll feed you, and dress you, give you housing and child-care centers, houses of culture and sport.' And we worked our heads off, put out coal, and now we hear: ` Not only do you have to put out coal, you have to take care of yourself in everything else too.''' `` How do we do that?'' <PERSON> Yatsenko </PERSON> asked. `` No matter who you turn to with your requests and complaints, no good comes of it, only promises.'' Among the workers' 30 demands when the strike began were economic independence for the mines, extended vacations for underground workers and improved food and housing, the labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolmogorov </PERSON>, a worker in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, said greater financial independence for individual mines and increased night-shift pay were among the demands a government negotiating commission agreed to meet immediately. Providing better food and housing would take more time, he said. In the past, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has brutally repressed strikes and hushed them up, but walkouts by miners this year generally have ended in a few days with government concessions. Similar strikes were reported in March and April in the <LOCATION> Urals </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Norilsk </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Both ended without incident. Twenty-four miners were said to be staying underground at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> with demands similar to those made in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that tens of thousands of people were crowding the central square in Mezhdurechensk day and night. <PERSON> Kolmogorov </PERSON> said compatriots in the other <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> cities seemed to be demonstrating belated solidarity, perhaps not knowing the government had agreed on Thursday to meet nearly all the strikers' demands for the entire region `` There's a weak information connection and this is happening by chain reaction,'' he said in a telephone interview from the strike headquaters at his mine. In an open letter to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government, the <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> strike committee has demanded food supplies for miners `` in accordance with dieticians' norms,'' and that all privileges for mine officials be abolished, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. A letter from <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> miners published by Trud in January complained that more than 10,000 families were waiting for apartments; hospitals and clinics were as crowded `` as anthills,'' with patients waiting a week or more to see a doctor, and schools had two or three times as many students as they were designed to accommodate.

Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., and Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who were responsible for parts of the law, praised the proposed regulations published in the Federal Register Comments may be submitted by Sept. 12, although the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said later comments will be considered if possible. The Trade Act, signed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last August, provides authority for the rules that would allow the president to block a merger if he has credible evidence that the foreign interest taking control might act to hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security. If he decides on an investigation, he gets 30 days to begin it, 45 days to complete it and another 15 days to announce it. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has interpreted the law broadly to make sure that it covers different ways that a foreign firm could take over an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> one: a joint venture, buying up the assets, and defaults on loans as well as just buying a majority interest. `` In my view, all methods by which foreign control may be accomplished must be covered, including proxy solicitations which are certainly as viable a means of establishing control as equity ownership,'' he added in a statement. A proxy authorizes a person to cast the vote of stock owned by someone else. If an acquiring company gets enough proxies, it can take over a firm without paying a premium price for the stock. `` I am very pleased with action taken by the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Assocated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` The regulations carry out the commitment he made to us.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Secret Service officer who admitted a lobbyist and his party to the White House for a private, late-night tour is on administrative leave as the agency investigates possible procedural violations, a spokeswoman said Friday. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing its internal investigation into the activities of Officer <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> deGueldre </PERSON> `` very aggressively,'' and finds the allegations that deGueldre may have accepted gifts from the lobbyist `` very concerning.'' DeGueldre, who has acknowledged giving lobbyist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> a White House tour on July 3, 1988, around 11 p.m., was placed on administrative leave with pay recently, but <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said she did not know the date. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who was a registered foreign agent for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until 1987, has been linked by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to a homosexual prostitution ring that is under investigation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. The prosecutor said he is examining possible credit card fraud in the ring, which was broken up in February. The newspaper said it has obtained copies of vouchers indicating <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> was a customer. <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said the agency's internal probe was taking `` longer that usual'' because agents did not want to interfere with <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>' criminal investigation The Times reported that deGueldre organized at least four private White House tours for Spence, including one on which two male prostitutes were in the party. <PERSON> DeGueldre </PERSON> also told another <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer that he snatched china from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and he told the Times he accepted an $ 8,000 gold Rolex watch from <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does n't view a private tour as a `` breach of security'' because <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials and uniformed officers are permitted to give friends and relatives a peek at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>, site of the Oval Office. But the service wants to determine if deGueldre received `` possible favors'' in return for his hospitality, she said. <PERSON> DeGueldre </PERSON> did not return a telephone message left on his machine Friday. In an affidavit supporting a search warrant for deGueldre's house last week, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weare </PERSON> said deGueldre had admitted stealing from the presidential living quarters several pieces of china dating from the <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Weare </PERSON> said `` deGueldre admitted ... that he gave one piece of the china to <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who had it prominently displayed at his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' DeGueldre has denied committing any thefts or breaking any other laws or breaching security. The Times, in a story published Friday, quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers as saying another uniformed officer who worked the midnight shift at the White House with deGueldre has been reassigned. <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said she knew nothing about a second officer. Meantime, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamaria </PERSON>, a White House official, said there has been no change in policy regarding late night tours of the building since a memorandum she issued in mid-June. In the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, White House staff members can bring guests on private tours of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., after 1 p.m. on Saturday and all day on Sunday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations of contract fraud at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant that makes material for nuclear weapons, a top <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier this week, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE team assessing health and safety measures and other aspects of the plant's operation. `` Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' said Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` We're going in there to see what's wrong and what might need to be done to get into compliance.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that the investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing in contracting. He gave no details. The Fernald complex, about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, is a key contributor to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production. It processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear weapons production and makes uranium target elements for defense nuclear reactors. It's also one of the government's most seriously contaminated facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> this week proposed adding <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> to the Superfund list of high-priority cleanup sites. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has executed a compliance agreement outlining a schedule for dealing with contaminated silos, waste pits and barrels _ a job estimated to cost $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the plant operator, said production was suspended to focus more work on clean-up. `` We're going to use all our people and concentrate on waste management until I'm satisfied we're on the right track and on schedule,'' said company president <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the contractor's decision was prompted by a DOE appraisal that pointed out weaknesses in plant maintenace and production-related training. `` They did the right thing: Get the people properly trained,'' he said. `` We envision they'll be back up in two to three weeks.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said `` it will be a lot longer than that'' before production can resume. <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> was given a production quota of about 1,000 metric tons for the current year, which ends Sept. 30. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said the complex had produced about 593 metric tons as of June.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will act this fall on both a constitutional amendment and a less-sweeping statute designed to overcome last month's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allows flag burning, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s announcement represented a compromise between those seeking quick action on an amendment and those urging caution before modifying the Constitution. However, by scheduling a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on the amendment, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> increased pressure on a resistant House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to do the same. `` It is my belief that this is a serious matter of importance to all Americans,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, adding that the compromise schedule would let the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approach the issue `` in a serious, mature, deliberate way.'' Republican leader Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., on Tuesday will introduce the constitutional amendment supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s agreement ensures that opponents of a constitutional amendment wo n't be able to use the statute to scuttle further action. `` That satisfies the concerns ... that we might pass a statute and say ` Well, that's the end of it,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Under the bipartisan agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would hold hearings and then report both approaches to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 22. Committee chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., would bring up the statute just before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recess in early October, and the constitutional amendment would lead the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> schedule right after the recess A majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including members from both parties, has agreed to co-sponsor the constitutional amendment, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>. Under the Constitution, a two-thirds vote in both chambers is required. A constitutional amendment also requires ratification by the states. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> constitutional law subcommittee has begun hearings and the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could act on a statute before the August congressional recess. Statute supporters, including <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., hope passions for a constitutional amendment may cool after the summer break A top aide to House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., who is co-sponsoring the constitutional amendment, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s announcement will `` turn up the burners here in the House The aide, who spoke on the condition his name not be used, said if <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders block a floor vote on the constitutional amendment the bill would be taken out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by a discharge petition. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passes a constitutional amendnent, I expect a discharge petition would happen pretty quick,'' he said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, offered legislation on Friday barring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> unless President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> certifies none of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participants were ever terrorists involved in the death, injury or kidnapping of an American. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said his amendment to a pending Statre Department authorization bill was a reaction to published reports that <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> has held talks in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 official. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON> as a key member of the Black September terrorist group, which murdered a group of athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and conducted a number of assasinations and hijackings, including the murder of <PERSON> Cleo </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, in 1973. `` This amendment poses a simple clear-cut question: should <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials negotiate with terrorists responsible for the deaths of innocent Americans?'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asked. The amendment, which will be debated next week, appears intended at derailing the U.S.-PLO talks begun after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exist, a condition set by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was not clear what action the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might take or whether the amendment stands a chance of becoming law. `` While the name of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON> may not be well known to our ears, the murder of innocent people _ which he directed _ still echoes in our memory,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is involved in negotiations with a man who murdered Americans,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` Despite <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>'s histopry of crimes against Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has now endowed upon him the respectibility inherrent in serving as a negotiating partner with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` By so doing, it has sent a signal to other terrorists that violence can pay.''

The woman, <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, already is under federal criminal indictment for allegedly embezzling the money she collected in her role as a closing agent for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s single-family sales and acquisitions program. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s civit suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, names as defendants Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> and her company, <ORGANIZATION> KenLo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She is one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agency believes bilked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 10 million The suit against her is the second filed by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to recover the money allegedly stolen. `` This is part of our ongoing and aggressive effort to recapture money from those who have done so much harm to the taxpayer adn those who are in need,'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the suit. The suit alleges Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> diverted for personal use $ 2.52 million in proceeds from the sale of HUD-owned properties. It alleges she deposited the funds in personal bank accounts and used the money to buy real estate, cars and guns. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> asked that any property bought with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money be declared government property. The suit was filed under a law that allows the government to seek triple damages from fraud, meaning Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> could be held liable for up to $ 7.5 million. Her attorney did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment on the suit. Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 1 and charged with 55 counts of embezzlement and 24 counts of money-laundering. At the time, prosecutors said conviction on all counts would carry a maximum sentence of 1,030 years in prison and $ 25.75 million in fines. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> suspended its contract with her after the indictment was returned. The indictment said the $ 2.52 million was divered after Ms. <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON>, under a contract with the government, served as a closing agent on the sale of 55 HUD-owned properties in the <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area between July and October of last year. The indictment alleges that <PERSON> Lovell </PERSON> made 24 deposits of about $ 9,900 each to the former <ORGANIZATION> M-Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> to avoid federal laws requiring banks to report transactions of $ 10,000 or more. She was released on personal recognizance after a court apperance in the criminal case.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired on Palestinian stone-throwers in the occupied territories Friday, killing two teen-agers and wounding at least 20, Arabs and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, masked men fatally stabbed a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists reported. The army confined 150,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to their homes in an effort to curtail violence on the second day of a major Moslem feast. In southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a Jewish man was beaten to death in the town of <LOCATION> Gan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yavne </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the elderly building contractor was slain by two Palestinian workers to whom he owned money. The killing raised anti-Arab emotions in the town, and news reports said residents gathered in the streets to demand that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> workers be banned from <PERSON> Gan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavne </PERSON>. Soldiers shot the two Palestinians to death in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and Jabaliya, according to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and Arab hospital officials. The victims were identified as <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Soubhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussa </PERSON>, 18, of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayeh </PERSON>, 15, of Jabaliya, both shot in the chest. At least 20 Palestinians were reported wounded in stone-throwing confrontations with soldiers, most of them in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> refugee camps, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists reported. Friday's deaths brought to 563 the number of Palestinians killed in the 19-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Most have been shot to death by soldiers, but more than 70 were killed as alleged collaborators. Thirty-five Israelis have been slain. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said masked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists killed <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Amasi </PERSON>, 26, in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amasi </PERSON> was a hashish dealer suspected of collaborating with Israeli security forces, the reports said. The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating. Curfews were reported in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city; the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, and nearby villages. Soldiers also blocked some roads from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Moslems are observing Eid al-Adha, a four-day feast at the close of the annual pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrogate militia was killed and two were wounded by a mine that exploded near <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>, north of the Israeli `` security zone,'' the army said.

It calls on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make sure the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> understand `` that until they recognize the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people's legitimate desire for democracy, human rights and justice, that relations between our two countries will remain strained.'' The sanctions amendment was attached to pending legislation authorizing $ 4.66 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and allied agencies during the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1. Reacting to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, `` We feel that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed sanctions that are meaningful and that adequately convey our sense of condemnation of the events that occurred in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. We also believe that we need to be mindful of long-term relationships with that country as we move forward.'' He said there is a `` fair degree of unanimity'' among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' summit partners on the issue. He said the administration would consider the legislation `` but generally speaking, we think we have taken the right course, that that has been recognized by other nations of the world. We feel it's also supported and recognized by the American public. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> noted that while the amendment requires the president to suspend certain trade programs, it also has a provision which `` gives him the flexibility to cease any suspension or termination ... if he finds it in the security interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to do so.'' The measure adopts several sanctions adopted earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. These include six-month suspensions of trade insurance by the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds to support trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Other sanctions include the suspension of export of satellites intended to be launched by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the suspension of nuclear cooperation until the president can certify <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not involved in nuclear proliferation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also adopted a series of non-binding suggestions in which they urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take stiffer steps. He should, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> said: _ Direct the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to immediately postpone approval of applications for financing American exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ Instruct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives at international financial institutions to oppose all loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ Review the advisability of continuing to extend to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> most-favored-nation trade treatment _ Review all trade agreements between the two countries _ Review commercial agreements governing Chinese-American cooperation on satellite launches _ Review the Chinese-American agreement on the peaceful uses of atomic energy _ Consult with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies at the upcoming economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on adopting a collective economic response to repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ Review high technology exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> endorsed the amendment, saying the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has `` shown no signs of relenting'' in its persecution of those who took part in or appeared to encourage the pro-democracy demonstrations. `` They are still sliding down a very slippery and dangerous slope,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Those voting against the sanctions amendment were Sens.

<HEAD>Court Orders Rewrite of Oil Spill Cleanup Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Friday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to rewrite rules for cleaning up after oil spills, saying costs must include more than just the monetary value of animals killed. The decision could affect damage payments made by oil companies involved in spills, such as the March 24 accident that occurred when the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Environmentalists hailed the unanimous decision by the three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think it's a major victory for the environment because it means that polluters will no longer get off the hook and they will have to pay for the whole cost of spills,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, one of the private organizations that joined with 10 states to bring the lawsuit. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the action makes oil companies more responsible. `` If the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeals the ruling, it means President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge to hold <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s feet to the fire is nothing more than a cynical exercise,'' he said. The court, ordering the rules rewritten, said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had drawn the regulations too narrowly in trying to implement the 1977 Clean Water Act and the 1980 Superfund law. Department spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the agency had just received the ruling and would have no immediate comment. The ruling, he said, was being discussed with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials but no decision had been made about whether to appeal. The 1986 laws in question require the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to design regulations to determine the monetary costs of oil spills. The department had created a computer model listing the `` lost use'' values for various types of wildlife. For example, the cost of a fur seal was set at $ 15, based on the expected value of a seal pelt. The cost of geese ranged up to $ 35, based on their popularity among hunters. But the appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had intended that the repayment plan be more broadly drawn to consider not simply the value of lost wildlife but the larger cost of restoring the damaged environment to its previous condition. The limited regulation is `` directly contrary to the clearly expressed intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as is therefore invalid,'' the court said. `` Because in some _ probably a majority _ of cases, lost-use-value will be lower than the cost of restoration, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s rule will result in damages awards too small to pay for the costs or restoration,'' the ruling said. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not set a damage assessment for either the Alaskan spill or three smaller spills last month along the eastern and southern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coasts.

 Angry abortion opponents on Friday urged media magnate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to quit calling them `` bozos'' and other names and give their cause equal time on his cable network. About 10 people picketed <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to object to <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' planned cablecast of a documentary, `` Abortion For Survival.'' The show, produced from the point of view of those who favor a woman's right to have an abortion, is scheduled to be shown on <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s TBS network next Thursday. The protesters also objected to his labeling anti-abortion forces `` idiots'' and `` bozos'' in a talk with cable operators Wednesday. One carried a sign that read, `` I'm no Bozo.'' The demonstrators demanded that <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> also program an anti-abortion documentary, `` Eclipse of Reason.'' The film, produced by Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, shows a fetus aborted at 24 weeks. <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kitsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggall </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> to Life requesting the use of of `` Eclipse of Reason.'' `` It is under consideration, but no decision has been made,'' she said. Turner announced the program during a meeting of cable executives. He said that after the program, there would be a televised debate including Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., an abortion foe; <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wattleton </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood; and <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, president of March for Life `` We'll give the other bozos a chance to talk back,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` They look like idiots anyway.'' <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyert </PERSON> said in a statement Friday that the group thinks <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has failed in his responsibility to be impartial. They also objected to the flippant nature of his comments. `` Abortion is no joke. Babies are dying. It does n't take much brains to know that,'' the statement said. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has thrown down the gauntlet, and we intend to fight.'' Ms. <PERSON> Boyert </PERSON> said her group does n't plan continued focus on <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, but wanted him to know they are `` disappointed with the biased programming.'' TBS got about 20 calls from viewers Thursday, about half of them objecting to <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s comments or the premise of the abortion program. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the volume of calls about doubled Friday, but could n't provide exact numbers or say what the callers said.

<TEXT>
 An oil tanker sailed past a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> naval blockade Friday and docked at a Christian port, triggering an artillery duel between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners that killed seven people and wounded 12. The thud of exploding shells and whooshing sound of rockets echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as Syrian gunners opened up on the Christian-controlled coast north of the capital. The fighting continued late into the night. A police spokesman said the unidentified tanker, which arrived at an undisclosed harbor north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was the second to reach the Christian enclave in the past two days with a cargo of badly needed fuel. On Wednesday, another tanker unloaded gasoline at <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> port, 18 miles north of the capital. The deaths from the artillery duel raised the overall toll to 416 killed and 1,627 wounded since the current confrontation erupted March 8 between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000-member force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Syrian gunboat intercepted the latest tanker in Lebanese territorial waters early in the day, searched it for weapons and ammunition and `` allowed the captain to resume his voyage. `` I do n't understand why Syrian gunners shelled the ship after the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> gunboat permitted it to continue,'' said the spokesman, who refused to give any details about the tanker and its cargo, citing `` security considerations.'' He said the Syrians shelled the Christian coast from positions in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the northern town of <LOCATION> Salaata </LOCATION>, on the edge of the 310-square-mile enclave. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners scored `` several direct hits on Syrian artillery emplacements in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the north.'' However, the claim could not be independently verified. Shells exploded near the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> in the city's Moslem sector, witnesses said. The Syrian military headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refused to comment. A police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing rules, said Syrian barrage concentrated on the 28-mile Christian stretch of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 130-mile Mediterranean coast. The Syrians have besieged the Christian enclave since March 12 in retaliation for a blockade <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that he said were depriving his government of $ 100 million a year in tax revenue. The Syrian navy joined the blockade earlier this month after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> claimed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> obtained Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles from its traditional Arab rival, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The missiles are capable of hitting <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his aides have refused to confirm or deny that they have Frog-7 missiles, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Thursday that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has the missiles, which have a range of more than 40 miles. An editorial in the official daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was `` expressing fear of missiles received by the regular Lebanese army.'' It did not elaborate. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are ruled by rival wings of the Baath party. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has declared support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s `` war of liberation'' against Syrian forces which entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of betraying their mandate by siding with the Moslems in the 14-year-old civil war which has killed more than 150,000 people.

<TEXT>
 Authorities are barring Vietnamese boat people from landing in this country, and at least 16 boats with nearly 900 people have been sent away to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees `` is surprised and disappointed'' in the new policy, said the agency's local representative, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON>. The new Malaysian policy began around May 25 without any notice to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency. Malaysian officials were not available to respond to <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON>'s criticism, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> and other officials have said repeatedly over the past few months that <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> was getting fed up with the crush of Vietnamese refugees <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> now has 22,000 of them, down from a peak of 76,500 in June 1979. Speaking in a telephone interview, <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON> said officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency do not know exactly how many boats that landed in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> have been towed back out to sea. But he said at least 16 boats with 886 people have been sent away. He said those boats were towed away between the end of May, shortly after the new policy went into effect, and July 7. However, he said the policy apparently is continuing. He said in one incident in mid-June, a boat with about 40 refugees capsized as it was being towed to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the east coast of this Southeast Asian country. A 23-year-old refugee drowned, but the others in the boat were picked up, put into another boat a week later, and towed away, <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON> said. He said that so far, all the expelled boats appear to have landed in nearby <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities were allowing the refugees to stay. On March 14, joining other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> imposed a policy of screening boat people to find those who were simply economic refugees. Such people would then be sent back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said repatriation must be voluntary. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is still adhering to its policy of allowing temporary asylum to refugees already here. They are to be permanently resettled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries. In 1979, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> officials also towed some boats away, but they stopped after a few weeks when Western nations promised to take more boat people.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs a president immediately to resolve a constitutional crisis, and he will support anyone the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> puts up. The president is to be elected by a joint vote of the both houses of the new parliament, in which Solidarity is strongly represented. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, said June 30 he would not run for the new, more powerful presidency because he was too closely linked with the martial law he imposed in December 1981 to crush Solidarity. Under agreements signed in April, the independent labor union was made legal again and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> held its freest postwar elections, in which Solidarity trounced the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement released by an aide, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Friday: `` I will cooperate with any president elected ... no matter if it is Gen. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> or some other representative'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` in order to solve Polish problems.'' When <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said he would not seek the presidency he recommended <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who is interior minister and negotiated the April accords with Solidarity, but the party leadership asked him to reconsider his own candidacy. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has re-emerged as a likely candidate, especially after appearing frequently with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the American president's three-day visit. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s domestic and international situation requires a president, and `` the election ... should be held immediately.'' `` Our country faces a great chance, but at the same time we have a constitutional crisis connected with a delay in filling the president's office,'' he said. `` Extension of this situation causes additional dangers.'' <PERSON> Mikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the former unicameral parliament and now the lower house, said Thursday the election might take place by July 22, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s national day. <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit had eased controversy about <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s candidacy, but many Solidarity legislators were jailed during martial law and have said they will not vote for <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is not a member of the parliament and, in his statement, did not instruct Solidarity representatives how to vote.

 Recent liberalization of policies will help align the beef industries in a number of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries that share trading interests with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Friday. Other affected countries include <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, according to a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` The trade flows resulting from liberalization will be directly influenced by underlying patterns in beef production and consumption in these countries,'' the report said. A decline in cattle inventories during the decade 1976-86 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oceania </LOCATION> appears to be ending, although per capita beef consumption `` may not rebound to earlier levels,'' the report said. `` Continued growth in beef consumption and market access in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will become even more important to the beef-exporting countries.'' The report said diets of East Asians are shifting rapidly to more meats, dairy products, caloric sweeteners, and fats and oils, but less grain. `` In contrast, diets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oceania </LOCATION> are shifting to more grains and less beef,'' the report said.

 Police on Friday arrested a doctor accused of threatening the mayor of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> after the mayor said the late Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> bore responsibility for World War II. <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajiyama </PERSON>, 62, head of a private hospital in <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, sent Mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> two letters containing bullets, said <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Hiroharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Naoe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> told the municipal assembly in December that Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, known as Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> since his death in January, bore responsibility for World War II.

 A senator whose father has fought a prolonged battle with Alzheimer's disease introduced legislation Friday to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into efforts to find a cure. The legislation would quadruple federal research spending to $ 500 million by 1992 and provide additional money for services to help victims and their families. `` Researchers say -LRB- that -RRB- one or two additional steps we could find that link that might well solve Alzheimer's disease,'' Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, said at a news conference. Alzheimer's, an irreversible neurological disease that often robs its victims of their memory, intellect and ability to communicate, afflicts 4 million Americans and is expected to strike millions more as the Baby Boom generation ages. Two percent of the population between the ages of 75 to 85 have the disease and 20 pecent of those over 70 are afflicted, officials say. One of three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families is believed to have an Alzheimer's victim.

 Workers at a Roman Catholic convent on the edge of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp punched, kicked and dragged out an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> rabbi and six students who occupied the grounds Friday to demand the nuns leave. About 20 people, including uniformed and plainclothes police and a white-haired parish priest who would not give his name, watched as the workers ripped up the demonstrators' signs and assaulted them. Rabbi <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said his group suffered bruises, scrapes, bleeding noses and lips. Their clothes were torn and they were forced to leave the convent grounds. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the nuns watched from a window and did not try to stop the workers. Reporters could see see women inside watching, but they were not dressed in habits and appeared not to be nuns. `` It's extraordinary that in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> 50 years later, something like this could happen,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` I demand an apology from these nuns.'' The incident occurred five hours after the men climbed a 7-foot wrought iron fence and occupied a porch of the convent, located in a former Nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945, an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>'s group called the convent a `` desecration'' of the Jews' memory and protested the failure of Catholic authorities to meet a Feburary deadline to reolocate it The group went to nearby <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> but said they would return Sunday. `` What occurred today is going to strengthen our resolve all the more now,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` People should understand what peaceful non-violent protest is all about. I can not accept that the nuns would be looking through the window and not help us.'' The men had planned to occupy the convent until the end of the Sabbath on Saturday night and then stage more demonstrations Sunday against Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Under a 1987 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> declaration, signed by 18 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders, the cardinal was to transfer the 14 Barefoot Carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built farther from the camp. The controversy surrounding the convent has become more emotional since the deadline for moving the nuns passed on Feb. 22. The European director of B'nai B'rith said in June he was confident the situation was headed for a resolution based on new assurances by <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>. The cloister, founded in 1984, is a few feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp. The convent lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where political prisoners were gunned down by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> executioners in 1940 and 1941. Jews have condemned the presence of the convent at the concentration camp as a deeply offensive intrusion of Christian religious symbols. In May, 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in front of the convent organized by the Women's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> appealed to the Polish government, the independent Solidarity union and the Polish people to exert pressure to move the convent. He said that despite the February deadline, it appeared the nuns were refurbishing the building and grounds. `` Our patience has run out,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. After climbing the convent fence Friday, the rabbi and his students said prayers, sang religious songs and donned prayer shawls. One placard read `` Leave our holy martyrs in peace.'' Another said, `` Do n't darken the memory. This convent is a desecration of the 6 million.'' The men knocked on the convent door, but the nuns did not emerge. Instead, workmen on the second floor doused the group with water, jeered and told them to leave. `` How dare you throw water at a rabbi or any Jew here at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>! Shame, shame, shame on you!'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> shouted at the smirking workmen. He spoke English but the workers spoke only Polish, and his efforts to talk with them and other passersby were hindered by the lack of an interpreter. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> had announced the protest to Western reporters, some of whom were on hand for the demonstration. The workers had tried to expel the men earlier but retreated after police officers outside the convent gate shouted at them to stop. The police at first said they would take no action unless the convent asked. Before 5 p.m., however, the officers moved away and did not intervene when the workers approached the men, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. The protest caused anger and resentment among Poles who passed the convent during the day. `` This is our <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. What are you doing here?'' one middle-age woman said to the group. `` They should think about Palestinian Arabs,'' said another man, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Wron </PERSON>. `` It's a kind of rape because the sisters are innocent.'' A village priest came by and said there was an understanding between Cardinal <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> and Jewish groups that the nuns would leave, but that the sisters had not agreed. One woman looked at the priest and said, `` Are n't there more of us than them?''

 Attackers burst into a meeting of Kurdish activists and fatally shot the leader of an anti-Iranian faction and two other men, police said Friday. An Iranian diplomat was reported wounded. The Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's attack was carried out by `` the enemies of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' but it did not elaborate in its statement. However, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, the Iraqi-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, said the killings were carried out by the Iranian government to crush the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>. Austrian police said the dead included party leader <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON>, 59. State-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON> had requested a meeting with Iranian officials to seek Iranian amnesty for Iraqi Kurds who are being forcibly evacuated from their homes in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It also said <PERSON> Qassemlou </PERSON> was seeking a guarantee of safety for himself. The Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said one of the topics of discussion was `` requested immunity for the repentant members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> said `` Qassemlou has finally fallen victim to negotiations'' with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> have condemned, according to their telex sent to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON>. Qassemlou's outlawed wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been been fighting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for an independent homeland for Iranian Kurds. During Thursday's attack, an Iranian diplomat, who is also a Kurd, was seriously wounded, said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON>, a police chief in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The Iranian Embassy confirmed that Iranian officials were at the meeting. It said earlier meetings had `` indicated success was near.'' Neither Iranian nor Austrian reports cited a motive for the attack. <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> said the other two killed were Qassemlou aide <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghaderi-Azar </PERSON>, 37, a Kurd who police said had identification papers issued by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; and Iraqi-born <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mala </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasoul </PERSON>, 38, who held Austrian citizenship since 1985. The three, who were all shot in the head, were living in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> as political exiles. All members of the anti-Iranian party wing are said to live in exile. The wounded diplomat was identified as <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Diafari </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahraroodi </PERSON>. Police said he was not yet able to give a detailed account of the attack because he had been shot in the mouth. <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> said the shooting occurred in the evening inside an apartment near <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s center. The apartment was made available by an unidentified Austrian woman, he said. More than four people apparently took part in the meeting, <PERSON> Liebhart </PERSON> told reporters. Two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire before escaping, he said. Police said the attackers were unknown. It was not clear how they gained entry, since the door was not damaged, the police official said. The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and small enclaves of 500,000 each in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Qassemlou, who was educated in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, lived there in exile for several years. He fought the Iranian government alongside the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> and other opposition groups in the early 1980s. However, he later supported negotiations. The Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has another wing based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Under Iranian sponsorship, it is fighting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for an independent homeland for Iraqi Kurds. The Iraqi government recently has been accused of forcibly evacuating thousands of Kurds from their homes, razing towns in the northern Kurdish homeland and resettling Kurds in the south of the country. The government says the resettlement is to improve life for the impoverished Kurds. A short time before <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to their cease-fire, the Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, killing an estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last fall.

<TEXT>
 An animal-rights activist accused of planting a pipe bomb at a medical supply company that demonstrates equipment on dogs pleaded guilty Friday to charges of possessing two bombs found in her apartment. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON>, 34, entered the guilty plea in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. She still faces trial in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on attempted murder charges stemming from allegations she planted a radio-controlled, nail-filled pipe bomb outside the <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> headquarters of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Surgical </LOCATION> on Nov. 11. The medical supply company uses about 900 dogs a year to show doctors how to use its surgical staples _ anesthetizing the animals, operating on them and then destroying them. That bomb was found near the parking space used by the company chairman, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> was arrested before it exploded. After her arrest, police searching her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment discovered two more pipe bombs in an attache case stashed under a sink. `` I possessed two pipe bombs in my apartment,'' she said quietly after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> instructed her to describe the crime. She faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine when <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> sentences her Oct. 6. Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> has been in custody in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> since her arrest last November. She is scheduled for trial in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in October, said her attorney <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Beldock </PERSON>. When the crude bomb was found outside its headquarters, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical quickly condemned it as an example of the growing fanaticism of the animal-rights movement. However, it later turned out that the company had been watching Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> for some time, and that an undercover agent working for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical drove Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> and her bomb from her home to the company headquarters. The company maintains it was taking sensible measures to protect itself by monitoring Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON>. However, her lawyers argue she was set up by the company and that its agents encouraged Ms. <PERSON> Trutt </PERSON> to obtain the bombs and even provided money for them.

 Three dozen guns, many of them loaded, were found in April in a search of the plane of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the pilot who survived an 800-mile flight, bullet wound and crash-landing in the ocean, officials said Friday. In other results of scrutiny of Root's activities, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was involved in a state investigation into possible securities law violations, and documents at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> revealed that he repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the commission. All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. A search of Root's <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 at the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Airport on April 24 by federal and local officials revealed `` about 35 weapons and silencers and ammunition clips,'' including a machine gun that had not been registered with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Official who consented to an interview on condition that he not be identified. Most of the weapons, such as assault-style rifles and three .357 - caliber Magnum pistols, were loaded, the official In addition, the officials found handcuffs and an electrical stun gun as well as a five-gallon can of ether, a chemical used in the refining of cocaine, he said. Searchers, helped by a drug-sniffing dog, found no drugs on the plane. During a May 31 interview with Root by <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and a Customs agent, `` by and large he was able to account for legal possession of those weapons. The bottom line on this, with the exception of one weapon, a machine gun, most of these weapons were legal and legally registered.'' The machine gun had been registered, as required by federal law, with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities charged Root with a misdemeanor for failing to register the gun with the state, he said. `` Basically, he indicated that he was a gun collector,'' the official said. But there was no indication from Root on why he kept the weapons on his plane, which was registered to a Washington-based company he owns, nor why they were loaded. Asked about the ether, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> told the officials that `` it was used to clean his aircraft, but of course that's not what you use to clean an aircraft with unless you're going to blow it up,'' the official laughed. Officials did not close the case `` because when you come across this many weapons ... we always continue to take a look to make sure no Customs laws have been violated.'' `` This is weird, to say the least,'' he said. The official said all the guns were seized and had not yet been returned to Root by state authorities. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile is conducting a preliminary investigation of what happened on the plane, said spokesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON>. `` It's an unusual incident and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction in crimes aboard aircraft, so the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is looking into it to see if there are any violations of federal criminal statutes,'' <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON> said. Root's plane crash-landed, and he swam to rescuers. <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said Root had been shot, the bullet going through his left rib cage and his colon, leaving his body, then going through his arm. A powder burn indicated Root was shot at close range, the chief said. An investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, was to interview Root for the first time on Saturday, said agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said of Root, `` Our office has spoken to him'' in regard to a securities probe. `` Obviously he knew he was under investigation,'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said. `` The investigation has been focused on <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and while he is not employed by them, he has ties to them and has been an integral part of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said. Sonrise said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> that Root `` in no way represents'' the firm. `` The only connection with Mr. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> is that he represents certain entities which also number among our clientele,'' said the firm. `` SMS is in the business of helping individuals and other associations secure FCC licenses to open and operate radio stations,'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said. `` A very substantial part of their business is done in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was the attorney for investment partnerships formed by Sonrise. Sonrise Properties was competing with <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, radio station <ORGANIZATION> WCEC </ORGANIZATION> for a new FM station, said <ORGANIZATION> WCEC </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. Root also was majority owner of radio station <ORGANIZATION> WSWR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was flying to <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> to meet a client, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooring </PERSON>, who is managing partner of a group that has applied for a license to operate an FM radio station here, she said. Root was supposed to meet her at <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount-Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> but never showed up, she said Friday. <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sonshine </PERSON> would form a group of investors and `` a legal entity, a partnership of some kind, is formed, and that partnership makes an application to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for a broadcast license. Mr. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> then becomes the attorney for the partnership or group.'' `` There are some allegations that the way it's set up is a way to avoid securities laws,'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said. Sonrise sent out a recent notice to a client listing several instances involving Root that it said `` caused us great concern'' and offering to pay the costs if the client opted to select a different lawyer. Sonrise said that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has stated that Root in at least four cases `` has failed to honor important procedural dates including failure to appear for a deposition and flagrant default with regard to answering interrogatories.'' Root failed to appear for a required desposition involving <ORGANIZATION> Timothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, which he represented in a bid to obtain a broadcast license in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> documents show. Just 45 minutes before his scheduled appearance under subpoena, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> submitted via facsimile a motion purporting to dismiss <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s application for the license, which also was being sought by <ORGANIZATION> McClenahan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. FCC administrative law judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chachkin </PERSON> wrote in his order dismissing <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s application: `` Root's failure to provide earlier notice of his intention not to appear for deposition, requiring <PERSON> McClenahan </PERSON> to pay the costs of a court reporters, can not be condoned. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said investigators `` have not come to any conclusions and have not ruled out anything at all.'' She said the agency's investigators had ordered independent tissue examination to check a police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conclusion that Root suffered a single-bullet gunshot wound. Blood tests were also being taken to check for drugs or carbon monoxide. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> records showed that Root has had a private pilot's license since 1970, when he was 17. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON> of the Airman and <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> said his record as a pilot was clean, with no incidents, accidents or enforcements.

<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> returned Friday from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to resume his presidential candidacy, 23 days after quitting the race in a dispute with members of his coalition. Hundreds of supporters waving flags and handkerchiefs greeted him with shouts of `` President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON>'' as he stepped off the plane. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> criticized the `` outdated, irresponsible and demagogic politics that have characterized <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in recent years'' and that have been rejected by the `` vast majority'' of Peruvians, who are to vote for president next spring. He rode in a motorcade to his seaside home in a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> suburb, where he spoke to supporters from his balcony. `` In this moment, the only priority is the salvation of our fatherland, stopping its fall into impoverishment, incompetence and self-destruction,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> told the crowd. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> had sent a letter to party leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> when he quit the race June 22, saying he was dropping out because of `` petty and mediocre'' motives of some in the party. The leaders in the center-right coalition had disagreed over whether each party should field its own candidates in November's municipal elections <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> said he could not be a candidate for the coalition without the united support of the parties. He said that support would be impossible if the parties had to battle each other in the local elections. The writer resumed his candidacy July 2 after the parties agreed to nominate single candidates representing the front in the elections, which are expected to be a test run for the presidential election, tentatively scheduled for April 1990.

 Thunderstorms drenched central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and northwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Friday, forcing people from their houses, flooding a nursing home and washing tombstones from cemetery plots. Most of the streets in <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, became impassable when 1 to 1 -LCB- inches fell in about 30 minutes. Some police encountered water as high as the hoods of their car. Showers and thunderstorms also continued across much of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Friday. Over 2 inches of rain fell around midday in portions of <LOCATION> Payne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, high water from torrential rains temporarily blocked a highway south of <PERSON> Durant </PERSON> and inundated a nursing home in <LOCATION> Calera </LOCATION>. The storm dumped 6 inches of rain in the <LOCATION> Durant </LOCATION> area within a few hours. In <LOCATION> Calera </LOCATION>, volunteers sandbagged doors of the Calera Manor nursing home after heavy rain sent flood water surging into the low-lying area. Before the sandbags were in place, 5 to 6 inches of water flooded most of the building, officials said. No residents were evacuated because officials feared traveling on the flooded roads would be more dangerous. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 8 inches of rain fell in parts of northern <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> and Vermilion parishes early Friday. In <LOCATION> Opelousas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, the heavy rain forced at least 100 people out of their homes and moved about a half-dozen tombstones from their cemetery plots. Thunderstorms were widespread across the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula. A thunderstorm in the southern suburbs of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, brought almost 1 inch of rain in 40 minutes. Thunderstorms developed rapidly Friday afternoon over the foothills of the central and southern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> and in southern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms also hit parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> due to an upper level trough of low pressure. Skies were mostly sunny west of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 degrees at <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to 112 degrees at <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms scattered from the Carolinas across the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to much of the Great Lakes; numerous showers and thunderstorms from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> across northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the central Gulf Coast to northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; and widely scattered thunderstorms over eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>.

 A man who pleaded guilty to dealing in cocaine has been forbidden to marry or father children for four years, but he is n't about to appeal. He and his attorney consider the sentence _ handed down during a temporary moratorium that bars overcrowded state prisons from accepting new inmates _ a bargain. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, will remain confined to his home except during working hours under a home detention provision in the sentence. He also must perform 160 hours of community service. `` The judge said, ` I do n't know if this is constitutional or not,''' <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said Friday. `` And he looked at me and I shook my head no, and then he turned to my client and said, ` But it's your choice.''' <ORGANIZATION> Bartholomew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, in pronouncing sentence Monday in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, cited what he called <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON>'s history of instability. The judge said <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON> fathered a child several years ago whom he is not supporting. `` I'm going to order that you not get married and also that you not father any children during that time,'' the judge told <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON>. `` That may be an improper imposition on your rights, but I could send you to prison.'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> did n't respond to a telephone request for comment Friday. <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON> did n't answer either, and <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said he was out getting the telephone he'll need so authorities can make sure he's home when he's supposed to be. `` At this point we do n't intend to appeal,'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. `` He's happy he is n't going to prison The judge could have given him 10 years in prison.'' Acting under federal court orders to ease prison crowding, the state imposed a five-day moratorium on accepting new inmates in its prisons Monday. <PERSON> Axsom </PERSON> was charged with two counts of dealing in cocaine, a felony that could have brought him 40 years in prison, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. The defense agreed to plead guilty to one count if the prosecution dropped the other count and made no sentencing recommendation.

 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the communications lawyer pulled from <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> waters in a dramatic rescue, repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, according to documents released Friday. Root also represented numerous clients of a Georgia-based company that another broadcast firm labeled a `` notorious application mill'' for FM broadcast licenses that allegedly has bilked hundreds of individuals of their investments. The firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a month ago encouraged clients to stop doing business with Root, offering to cover their initial retainer fee if they switched lawyers. The firm said that `` in at least four occasions'' he had failed to honor important procedural dates'' at the FCC. Two communications lawyers who had dealings with <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said he was known to have filed numerous license applications at the FCC that were rejected or dropped because of misrepresentations, missed deadlines, and other problems. `` Lots of people in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- FM branch has got a Tom Root story,'' said communications attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` He was hard working but he was overwhelmed by the number of cases he had.'' Police in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> disclosed Friday that Root suffered a gunshot wound, apparently during his 800-mile, unconscious flight that ended with a crash in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and rescue at sea. Root told his brother-in-law the wound was n't self-inflicted. In one instance of a missed appearance involving his law practice, Root failed to appear for a required deposition involving <ORGANIZATION> Timothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, which he represented in a bid to obtain a broadcast license in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> documents show. Just 45 minutes before his scheduled appearance under subpoena, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> submitted via facsimile a motion purporting to dismiss <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s application for the license, which also was being sought by <ORGANIZATION> McClenahan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. FCC administrative law Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chachkin </PERSON> wrote in his order dismissing <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>'s application: `` Root's failure to provide earlier notice of his intention not to appear for deposition, requiring <PERSON> McClenahan </PERSON> to pay the costs of a court reporter, can not be condoned. <PERSON> McClenahan </PERSON>, in a filing before the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, charged that <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> was in fact controlled by Sonrise, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, which it said was `` notorious in <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> comparative hearing cases.'' Sonrise _ which advertises itself as offering `` Management with a Christian Ethic'' _ issued a statement Friday denying Root served as its legal counsel. It said Root `` represents certain entities which also number among our clientele.'' Officials in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> said Friday that <PERSON> Sonrise </PERSON> was being investigated for possible securities law violations and that Root was part of that probe. `` The investigation has been focused on <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and while he is not employed by them, he has ties to them and has been an integral part of the investigation,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Announce Inquiry Into Shooting Death Linked to Military Ruler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The attorney-general's office Friday announced a judicial inquiry into a shooting death that foreign news reports linked to the military ruler of this small African kingdom. Student <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramone </PERSON>, 20, was shot to death last December at the <ORGANIZATION> Lesotho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Despite his parents' pleas, no inquest or inquiry was held, and no one was arrested or charged. Early in July, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Observer, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and several <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> newspapers carried reports saying Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Metsing </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekhanya </PERSON>, 51, leader of a six-man military tribunal, was alleged to have shot <PERSON> Ramone </PERSON>. The reports said <PERSON> Lekhanya </PERSON>'s bodyguard told police he had shot the student to stop an attempted rape, but that <PERSON> Lekhanya </PERSON> made a subsequent statement to the ruling military council saying he actually had done the shooting while `` on patrol'' on the campus. The alleged rape victim, reported to be an employee of a lecturer at the university, has made no comment. The <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> government and the local press have remained silent about the case, although the foreign newspapers freely circulated in this country surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The members of the military council, who took power in a Jauary 1986 coup that toppled left-wing dictator <PERSON> Leabua </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, have held several lengthy, closed meetings on the subject, according to sources close to the government. The attorney-general's announcement Friday made no mention of <PERSON> Lekhanya </PERSON>, but referred to the foreign newspaper reports. <PERSON> Ramone </PERSON>'s parents said the judicial inquiry was to be held July 30.

<HEAD>California Fire Near Containment; Lightning Threatens More Blazes
in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters predicted victory over a big blaze on the scenic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast Friday, as smaller wildfires burned in central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Lightning was expected in a wide swath from <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, bringing the threat of more lightning-sparked fires, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` The fires have decreased with the humidity,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, spokesman at the center. `` But the prognosis is for light activity due to lightning.'' A `` red flag'' warning was issued for the eastern slopes of the Cascade range in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of the lightning threat, he said. The largest blaze still out of control was at Big Sur, on the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast south of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. The 6-day-old arson blaze had scorched 3,000 acres of brush and timber, but more than 1,500 firefighters made headway Friday, their work made easier because winds were light. The fire was 70 percent contained and crews hoped to get it fully contained by nightfall, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deumejian </PERSON> has offered a $ 50,000 reward for information on whoever started the fire, which has done an estimated $ 1.4 million damage to timber and cost $ 1.3 million to fight. A 3,000-acre brush fire ignited by tracer rounds at the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>' Camp <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON> was contained Friday, said a base spokeswoman, Cpl <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Shryock </PERSON>. In central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, a lightning-sparked timber blaze in <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> that was considered contained Monday flared up, and had grown to 700 acres by Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. About 120 firefighters battled the fire, and experts did n't know when it would be contained. In the <ORGANIZATION> Tonto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> to the east, 250 firefighters attacked a `` sleeper'' fire that started last weekend and stayed small and unnoticed, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. That blaze had burned 150 acres of timber by Friday, he said, and `` it has the potential to get much larger.'' Meanwhile, outside <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, 565 endangered <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> trout scooped from streams choked with fire-generated ash adjusted to temporary quarters at the Mescalero Fish Hatchery. `` They're swimming,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesecke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> assistant manager of the hatchery. `` They seem to be doing fairly good this morning.'' The fire, which burned 10,000 acres of timber and brush northeast of <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was contained Monday. But the ash continued to settle. The trout will stay at the hatchery until the water level in their home creek returns to safe levels, and the ash _ which cuts the water's oxygen-carrying capacity and raises its alkalinity _ gets clear enough for safety.

<HEAD>US Making Progress on Compensation Concerning Iran Air Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is prepared to announce a compensation offer early next week for families of the non-Iranian victims on the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight shot down by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship a year ago, officials said Friday. All but 40 of the 290 people who died were Iranian. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would pay compensation to all families, but the Iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens who died, such as their ages. The 40 non-Iranians were Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japanese and citizens of several Arab countries. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has said it will not pay the Iranian government directly, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has called that position `` not acceptable.'' In civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a family member. Thus families of people who die early in lucrative careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people. It is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the government's compensation offer. The officials, who asked not to be identified, were unable to provide figures on the compensation package they expect but said a formal announcement was expected early next week. The absence of diplomatic relations, broken nine years ago when hostages were seized in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, has complicated efforts to arrange payments for the Iranian victims. Testifying on the issue earlier this week, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said that the administration hopes to be able to resolve the problems concerning compensation for the families of Iranian victims by working through third countries and non-governmental organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The Airbus A300 plane was on a flight from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, mistaking it for a hostile fighter about to attack, shot it down with a missile. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which seeks compensation for the loss of the plane, has sued the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> over the incident, and relatives of some victims have sued the manufacturer of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> radar system, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, an ex-law school student identified as a suspect in the nation's worst unsolved serial murder case, never seemed to throw anything out, except for details of his life on the run. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is described by <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> task force investigators in a court affidavit as a man who collected police badges and old police cars and meticulously kept dated gas receipts and maintenance records of vehicles he had n't driven in years. Yet former friends and acquaintances say he rarely discussed much of his past in detail. The task force is investigating the slayings of as many as 48 women in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> between 1982 and 1984. It was seven years ago this week that the first <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victim was found. `` He was a kind of a shadowy kind of guy, I mean he was there, but he was n't,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we were all trying to figure him out because he was n't your typical law student.'' Police arrested <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> at his parents' home in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> last January on charges of escaping from a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> work-release facility in 1981. He had been serving time for burglarizing a police equipment business in October 1979. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had attended law school for 3 -LCB- years at the time of his rearrest, and had twice served as student bar president at <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION>. It is his life from 1981 to 1985, when he enrolled at <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> task force is interested in. Police say <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was in the vicinity of several of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims, many of them prostitutes, when they were last seen, and that he traveled extensively between <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, area. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was the oldest of three adopted children. They were raised in a three-bedroom house in a tidy, placid neighborhood of single-family homes north of the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> city limits. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' mother recently died, and his father, who declined an interview Friday, recently underwent an operation for a brain tumor, according to former acquaintances. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was known, went to Catholic schools and, like any other child, played in the streets with neighbors' kids. He was a heavy-set child who kept a collection of police badges in a glass case, and who later bought used police cars at auctions. King County Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, commander of a task force investigating the case, said that investigators had speculated that the killer `` could be a cop or someone posing as a cop.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would often visit his parents after moving to the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area to attend the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, where he graduated in 1975 with a degree in psychology. That summer, he took courses in sociology and pharmacology. His father owned a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> pharmacy. He apparently entered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> after undergraduate school, and served as an officer in charge of a military police unit. Acquaintances said he dated, but most could n't recall any serious relationships. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, told investigators <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> often went on `` missions,'' disappearing for days at a time. He also once showed a secret room behind a bookcase in the basement of a home he lived in in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. She said she once asked him if he was the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer. He replied: `` Do n't start that rumor. People around here think I'm weird enough. <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>, who described herself as `` probably the closest thing he had to a friend,'' described <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as `` bizarre'' and `` anti-social.'' But another woman who knew <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Gonzaga </LOCATION> described him as `` outgoing, friendly,'' and who took took more passion in his student bar activities than he did to classroom work. `` That's his thing. He likes working with organizations and helping people,'' said the woman, a Seattle-area attorney, who did not want to be identified. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was dismissed from law school after his rearrest in January for falsely stating in his application that he had never been convicted of a felony. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> added that <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> records indicate <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in pharmacology, and that he had also attended <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruddy </PERSON> said his school had no record of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>.

 A parade of moonwalking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college students, ponies painted to look like zebras, and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> bear on skates lent fantasy to Saturday's celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. It also offered a somber reminder of the price of liberty. In a late change of program after last month's repression in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, hundreds of Chinese students walked bicycles around a giant red drum. They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters for `` Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'' the watchwords of the French Revolution. The 250 musicians of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M band, gliding backwards in a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moonwalk down the Champs-Elysees before a crowd estimated at 1 million, offered a tribute to American soul star <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. They shared the famous avenue with Scottish pipers marching in artificial rain, Soviet guards walking in fake snow, a huge steam locomotive, and other creations of the imagination of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> advertising maverick <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>. The $ 15 million extravaganza of fantasy and symbolism was called the `` The Marseillaise,'' a parade described by <PERSON> Goude </PERSON> as a `` slightly frivolous opera-ballet.'' Besides the lively crowds in the street, about 30 presidents and prime ministers gathered on a balcony overlooking the Place de la Concorde. They were in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to attend the festivities and participate in an annual summit conference of industrial nations, which began Friday. Television audiences in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> also watched the parade, which began late Friday and extended into early Saturday. French television showed <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> peering through binoculars at the 6,000 performers. Viewers saw President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, chatting with other guests as fireworks lit up the sky. Temporary grandstands on the Place de la Concorde held about 16,000 other invited guests, including celebrities and officials. They also provided seating for French citizens born on July 14 or with the first name `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' July 14, or Bastille Day, marks the day 200 years ago when a group of Parisians stormed a royal prison that once stood at the Place de la Bastille. In an emotional climax of the parade, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> opera diva <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, wrapped in the blue, white and red colors of the French flag, sang the rousing verses of the national anthem, `` The Marseillaise.'' <PERSON> Elyiane </PERSON> <PERSON> Picard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION>, bedecked with revolutionary tricolor buttons, held on to a few inches of standing space at the base of an iron fence along the Champs-Elysees for nine hours to watch the show. `` The parade is something I never would have wanted to watch on television,'' she said. `` It's a historic happening, and I wanted to be able to tell my children I was there.'' Twelve hours earlier on the same parade route, silver-helmeted Republican Guards pranced below jet fighters trailing the national colors in a display of precision, pomp and firepower. More than 250 planes and helicopters streaked down the length of the flag-bedecked avenue. Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legionnaires </ORGANIZATION>, 300 armored vehicles, and unarmed mobile missiles flowed down the avenue to martial music. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> reviewed the troops at the Place de L'Etoile. Then, standing upright in a light reconnaissance vehicle, he rode down the grand avenue to the Place de la Concorde. There, he joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other world leaders in the presidential tribune at the site where the guillotine stood during the revolution. Frenchmen and tourists danced through the night Thursday at balls around <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The capital's gala will wind up later Saturday with the traditional fireworks display at the Eiffel Tower. `` We're here helping to celebrate what we started with our revolution and the French finished,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who brought his family to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the bicentennial. `` This grandeur, beauty, pageantry and feeling of nationality _ this is what we wanted the children to capture.'' The center of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was all but closed to traffic for the day's events and a security dragnet the government described as the tightest since World War II was in full evidence A dirigible with special security cameras surveyed the crowds before the military parade began.

 Leaders of the world's seven richest nations, treated to the pomp and pageantry of the French bicentennial, got down to business Friday as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored an early victory on a contentious trade dispute with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but failed in efforts to speed approval of a Mexican debt deal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, making his first appearance on the world economic stage, brought a full agenda of items for discussion with the leaders of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In his opening remarks at the first session and later at a working dinner, the president discussed his just-completed trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and sought agreement from the other countries for a coordinated assistance effort to both nations, according to presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The other leaders had their own agendas to present. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has built a reputation as a champion of the developing nations, raised their demands that the rich industrial countries convene a conference to discuss the economic plight of the Third World. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> invited more than two dozen Third World leaders to the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution in an effort to promote the idea of a conference between the world's rich and poor. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> resisted these overtures. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said a case-by-case approach was a better way to handle the Third World debt burden rather than convening a giant international conference. `` You do n't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and calling them North and South,'' as the rich and poor nations are often reffered to, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told reporters. German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> urged his summit partners to adopt policies that would allow continued economic growth while reducing trade surpluses. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, maintaining that air pollution may pose the biggest threat to future generations, said the environment should be a central theme of the summit, according to his spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, briefing reporters after the first session ended, said that there was general agreement on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to boost aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> although questions remained on the specifics of coordinating the assistance. At dinner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> briefed his summit partners on his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` They spoke of objectives, the importance of the moment and of the latest changes,'' French spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> told reporters at a post-midnight briefing. The leaders also discussed `` the best way to aid these countries and how to act in a way that this aid is coherent and useful.'' Though he declined to go into specifics, <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> said the possible role of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of western creditor nations and other organizations was discussed. The leaders planned to put the finishing touches on their political communique at their morning meeting Saturday. <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> said the document would touch on four subjects _ human rights, <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations, terrorism and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The 15th annual economic summit, the third to be held in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, began with the traditional show of harmony as the leaders posed for their `` class photo,'' using the new glass pyramid of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> museum as a backdrop. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the dean of summiteers with 10 years in office, was the first to arrive for the formal greeting by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Even before the summit opened, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> moved to cool trade tensions, which flared this year after the administration adopted a tough line targeting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as an unfair trader because of barriers to the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The action, brought under the 1988 trade law, would allow the administration to impose stiff sanctions on Japanese products within 18 months if negotiations failed to remove the barriers. While the Japanese reacted with outrage at being singled out, both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude Friday after a private meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. The Japanese, after initially balking at the idea, agreed to launch negotiations _ with a one-year deadline _ aimed at removing barriers to sales of foreign goods such as the Japanese distribution system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was less successful, however, at breaking a deadlock between negotiators trying to produce a debt-reduction plan for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The president began his day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> on the debt question. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced later that the administration would be willing to extend an emergency loan of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> if the money would help break a deadlock in current negotiations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the commercial banks that hold the bulk of its debt. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told reporters that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would ask other summit countries to help with the emergency loan, known as a bridge loan, which a country can use until it can get new money from its creditor banks. But the bridge financing offer did not immediately produce results in the Mexican debt talks, which remain stalemated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The first session of the Big Seven industrial countries coincided with the climax of three days of festivities marking the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille. After an evening spent discussing weighty global issues over dinner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other leaders adjourned to a balcony to watch the high point of the bicentennial celebration, a $ 15 million parade featuring English bagpipers marching in artificial rain and <LOCATION> Solviet </LOCATION> skaters dancing with a bear on ice as the crowd was sprayed with confetti snow. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat next to President <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest nations in the world, for a morning military parade down the <ORGANIZATION> Champs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION>, a seating arrangement undoubtedly inspired by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s desire to prompt discussions between rich and poor. Still, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has come under sharp criticism for the extravagance in staging the bicentennial events and for having two separate dinners Friday night for the rich and poor nations. The summit will devote a portion of Saturday's session to talks on a global initiative to clean up the environment, the first time an economic gathering has spent so much time on this topic. The talks will conclude on Sunday with the reading of a final communique and separate press conferences by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other leaders.

 Police disclosed Friday that attorney-pilot <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> had a gunshot wound when he was rescued in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> after his amazing 800-mile, unconscious flight down the East Coast. `` It was unquestionably a gunshot wound,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, who added that a powder burn indicated the shot was fired at close range and was possibly self-inflicted. Root said the wound was n't self-inflicted, and may have occurred on impact when his plane plunged into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, according to his brother-in-law, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>. Root, who is a gun collector, had a .32 - caliber handgun with him in the cockpit, <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> Investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in the plane. Root, 36, remained under heavy sedation at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON> said he was improving and was listed in stable condition. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said surgeons had found a wound to Root's abdomen, and determined that a bullet passed through his colon, exited, struck him in the left arm and exited again. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs official said authorities found three dozen guns, many of them loaded, in a search of Root's plane last April All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. A search of Root's plane at the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Airport revealed `` about 35 weapons and silencers and ammunition clips,'' including a machine gun that had not been registered with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said a customs official who consented to an interview on condition that he not be identified. Most of the weapons, such as assault-style rifles and three .357 - caliber Magnum pistols, were loaded, the official During an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and a Customs agent, Root `` was able to account for legal possession of those weapons. The bottom line on this, with the exception of one weapon, a machine gun, most of these weapons were legal and legally registered.'' Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> moved into the case because of the reported gunshot wound, spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> air safety investigator came to the hospital. Other federal investigators scattered to seek information on Root ranging from his financial situation to his psychological condition, his physical fitness, his flying ability and his guns, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator said. With Root under sedation and his single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> believed to be at the bottom of Bahamian waters more than a mile deep, authorities turned their attention to `` multiple phone calls'' from people in several states making `` various allegations that have not been confirmed,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator. He declined to give details, but said they came from private citizens and government agencies on topics that included <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s finances and his pilot ability `` There are many questions I'll be asking,'' said <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>, who delayed until Saturday efforts to interview Root. `` We're not going to try to bother him today.'' In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said his office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a company with which Root was involved. Root acted as attorney for partnerships formed by the company, <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which helps other organizations secure <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> licenses to operate radio stations. <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said there are allegations that the company was set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws. `` You know these are only allegations,'' he added. `` This is just heightened because Mr. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> went down in the big waters. ... Obviously he knew he was under investigation. Our office has spoken with him.'' Root's wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, 35, planned to visit her husband Friday. On Thursday, she said she told hospital officials to send her husband the message: `` Root, you really did it this time.'' She told reporters Thursday night he had suffered a fainting spell about two months ago. She also said he had often flown private planes on business trips. <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>, 34, who lives in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he visited Root Thursday night and again Friday, when the pilot was sitting up in the chair in his hospital room. `` One thing he said was, ` Did this get on the news last night?' `` I think that's the understatement of the day,'' said <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said he hoped to interview Root's relatives. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> could n't confirm there was a gunshot wound but said a tissue sample from the burned area, blood samples and a `` very, very small'' metal fragment taken from Root would be analyzed in federal laboratories. `` It's pretty amazing, I agree with that,'' <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said of Root's journey on autopilot while shadowed by military and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> planes, and his survival and rescue by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> parachute rescuers Authorities earlier had speculated that Root may have had a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said Root could have been shot before takeoff, but the wound is believed to have occurred in the air. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s radio transmissions with control towers had been normal until he began heading past his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> destination and into a warning area, probably a military restricted zone. Root reported that he was having difficulty breathing, and then radio contact ceased. Military pilots reported seeing the pilot slumped over the controls. They did n't see anyone else aboard, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. Root's odyssey started on a 6:30 a.m. flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and ended when his out-of-fuel plane crashed into Bahamian waters at 12:20 p.m. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said there were no plans to try to raise the plane. For nearly four hours, military jets shadowed the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 Centurion as it traveled down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. After the plane crashed, Root emerged wearing only pants and socks and swam clear of the craft minutes before it sank. `` It was a sight to see,'' said Air Force Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, whose parachute rescue team jumped 3,000 feet in 30 seconds to rescue Root. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government has authority over the case but has asked the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> to run the investigation. Ms. Wine, the hospital spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s family requested no information be released on the exact extent of his injuries. Root underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery Thursday.

 An autopsy conducted Friday determined that a priest found dead in northern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> suffered a fractured rib and sternum and had a high level of alcohol in his blood, the state news agency said. The cause of death was not determined, however, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the Rev. <PERSON> Sylwester </PERSON> <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>'s injuries could have resulted when vacationers found him at a bus stop in the Baltic resort of <ORGANIZATION> Krynica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morska </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday and tried to revive him. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>, 39, was the third Roman Catholic Polish priest to die in unusual circumstances in the last six months. Unlike the other priests, <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was not known as an active supporter of the Polish opposition, although he had served a prison term for harboring a policeman's killer. At the time of his death <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> had been serving as a chaplain in <LOCATION> Olsztyn </LOCATION> province, a priest at the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said Friday. According to the autopsy, the level of alcohol in <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>'s blood and urine was several times the legal standard for drunkenness, the agency said. `` The post-mortem did n't show any injuries that could be the direct reasons of <PERSON> Zych </PERSON>'s death,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The final reason of ... death will be established only after research, which will be made at the same institute, and after a toxicology test made a specialized institute in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>,'' the agency said. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curia </ORGANIZATION> and independent lawyers were present at the autopsy, along with a Solidarity parliament deputy. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> had been vacationing at the parish of his former prison chaplain in <LOCATION> Braniewo </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Krynica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Morska </LOCATION>, and had dropped from sight on Sunday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajaczkowski </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the service, said the chaplain _ identified only as the Rev. Brandys _ read a newspaper item about the discovery of an unindentified corpse and was able to identify the body. The service said the body was not dressed in clerical clothing and had no money or documents on it. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was sentenced in 1982 to 3 -LCB- years in prison for providing shelter to a young man who had shot and killed a policeman during a scuffle on a tram car in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> three months after martial law was imposed in December 1981. <PERSON> Zych </PERSON> was arrested in March 1982, several weeks after the officer's slaying. The two men convicted of the killing were released from prison in December 1987. In January, the Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON>, a Solidarity supporter, was found dead of a broken neck in his <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> rectory. The case has not been solved. In February, another opposition supporter, the Rev. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>, was found dead after fire swept his home in the city of <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, about 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. An investigation concluded the fire was an accident. <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> was a friend of the late Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, who was murdered by security police in October 1984.

 A small plane crashed into a factory and burst into flames Friday shortly after takeoff, killing all three people on board, authorities said. Two people on the ground were injured, one seriously, when the plane hit a loading dock area of the factory. The single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 177 took off from <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> which serves the <LOCATION> Joliet-Lockport </LOCATION> area, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` It appeared on takeoff to be unstable and was moving at a low rate toward its climb. Suddenly it took a left turn, went down behind trees, struck a building and exploded into flames,'' he said. Authorities said witnesses indicated the engine of the aircraft was running, but appeared to be developing little power. Investigators of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> went to the site about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to determine the cause of the accident.

<HEAD>Jury Says Dairy Wasn't to Blame for Deadly Cheese Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dairy that supplied milk used in cheese infected with a deadly bacteria was not responsible for the 1985 disease outbreak that killed 48 people, jurors decided Friday. The panel voted 11-1 that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy could not be held liable along with the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Jalisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Artesia </LOCATION> for some $ 100 million in victims' claims. The jury began deliberations Monday. The decision means there could be little compensation for victims' families and leaves <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> as the sole defendant. Attorneys for <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> argued that <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> sold tainted milk to the cheese manufacture. But dairy lawyer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Novell </PERSON> told the jury that bacteria was never found in <LOCATION> Alta-Dena </LOCATION> milk or dairy herds, noting <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 customers during the period in question and only <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> had an outbreak of the severe, flu-like bacterial disease listeriosis. The bacteria was found in abundance in refrigerators, ants and even employees at the <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> plant, he told the panel. Juror <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said she agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Novell </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it had been in the herds, then it might have shown up elsewhere. But it did n't. It was only at <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION>,'' she said. More than 100 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the 30 fetuses and newborns and 18 adults who died in one of the nation's deadliest food-transmitted outbreaks of listeriosis <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON>, the state's largest dairy, supplied the raw milk to <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> to make the soft Mexican-style cheese, which was blamed for the 1985 outbreak of listeriosis. Most of the victims were unborn or stillborn fetuses or newborn babies, and almost all Hispanic. The epidemic also caused birth defects and a variety of stomach ailments. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> counted 142 cases of listeriosis between Jan. 1 and Aug. 15, 1985. Victims of the outbreak and their families wanted <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> to share responsibility. <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> owner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> and cheese maker <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> pleaded no contest in 1986 to misdemeanor criminal charges. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 days in jail and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> was sentenced to 60 days. Additionally, they were fined about $ 48,000. Listeria bacteria are common in the environment, but cause illness mainly in people with immature or damaged immune systems, such as babies, elderly people and AIDS and cancer patients. Listeriosis is fatal about 30 percent of the time, but also produces mild to severe flu-like symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, headache, nausea and vomiting.

 The military, run by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> once again Friday that pressure to remove him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler will not succeed. The rejection was contained in a statement read at a ceremony marking the bicentennial of the French revolution. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today, like <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> did yesterday, is struggling stoically against aggression, intolerance and lack of understanding,'' it said. `` Our objectives are sovereignty and self-determination, the right to choose and decide what we want, when we want it and who we want it with. `` We take advantage of this revolutionary celebration to exhort all those living in this isthmus to end the fight between brothers and ... join in peace and national concord, which should be our permanent crusade.'' Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators began another round of talks with Panamanian government and opposition leaders, and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant undersecretary of state for inter-American affairs, discussed regional issues with Central American leaders. Capt. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yueng </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, read the statement at the ceremony in the French Cemetery by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The ceremony also honored Frenchmen and people of other nationalities who died building the waterway 74 years ago. Among those present was <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, 99, one of the few surviving canal construction workers. Friday's statement was one of several rejections by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission was appointed after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled the May 7 presidential elections, which international observers said opposition candidates won by a 3-1 margin. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to arrange three-way talks among the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, government parties and opposition leaders to resolve the political crisis. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to get him out has included freezing Panamanian assets in American banks and other economic sanctions. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> is consulting with the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on the Panamanian situation and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s plans for national elections Feb. 25. He met President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> on Friday. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said he had met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> this week about a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> proposal for breaking the political deadlock. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said it involved `` organizing as of September a government of national unity with opposition participation, a government that will be in charge of preparing new elections.'' `` We are interested that the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> finds a way out ... because <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> affects the entire Central American region,'' he told reporters.

 Violinist <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> kicked off this summer's Mostly Mozart Festival at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> He played two violin concerti, by <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>, on opening night with the festival's orchestra and conductor <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>. They repeated the program the second night, Tuesday, which was televised. And on Wednesday the audience at <ORGANIZATION> Avery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> heard even more of <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> when he and pianist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalichstein </PERSON> played four sonatas for violin and piano. This third Mostly <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> evening was Entirely <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and wonderful. <PERSON> Kalichstein </PERSON> often plays chamber music with violinist <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Laredo </PERSON> and cellist <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and is known for playig 19th century music. <PERSON> Kalichstein </PERSON> sounded like a <ORGANIZATION> Mozart </ORGANIZATION> specialist on Wednesday. His chords were clean. Both played with dazzling timing. When the two instruments held a dialogue or echoed each other, the timing was perfect. The beautiful tone, and varieties of tone, that <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> gets from the violin is well known. <PERSON> Kalichstein </PERSON>'s tone also is splendid and he was n't afraid to create enough volume occasionally to swamp the violin. Neither created a thin sound. They proved that sound can be both lush and appropriately contained. The sonatas played were `` G major,'' for which the composer played violin at the 1781 premiere, `` D major'' and `` E minor'' from 1778 and `` A major'' from 1787. While fast passages, especially the last movement of the `` A major,'' which <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> composed four years before he died, showed the two musicians' virtuosity most excitingly, we most enjoyed the andante movements with their beautiful melodies. And in <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kalichstein </PERSON>, the Mostly Mozart Festival found the men to reach and calm the listener's soul in playing them.

 Rocketing 300 feet skyward in a plastic bubble mounted on a flimsy tower of piping is not every world leader's idea of a good time. Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, reputed to suffer vertigo at considerable heights, is taking another route to the cloud-bound confines of the 15th World Economic Summit at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arche </ORGANIZATION>. The sessions on debt, development and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc aid bring the world's most influential western statesmen to the upper slab of a controversial structure that looks much like a deep, glassless window frame. The rooftop summit site is a windowless, marble-encased concrete cocoon that spans two trapezoidal office towers at a height of more than 300 feet. Many have likened the Arche's exposed elevator shaft to scaffolding, and two stands of metal-pipe artworks flanking the structure's entrance also give the site a `` Men at Work'' motif. To picture the Arche, imagine a 35-story-high white cardboard box standing on its side, with the top and bottom flaps folded in to form a free-standing tunnel. The cavernous hollow below the summit site is large enough to hold the Notre Dame cathedral, including its spire. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON>, declined comment on a <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> newspaper report Friday that the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> prime minister would forego the elevators because of a fear of heights. <PERSON> Lavoie </PERSON> said it was his understanding that all seven leaders attending the summit would avoid the bubbles for security reasons, and that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s attitude toward heights `` is a matter of his private life.'' Journalists who have accompanied <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on other trips abroad, however, report that the prime minister categorically rejects all venues with exposed heights and even draws the curtains over windows of his jet when flying. Contrary to the Canadian view, at least one of the leaders is taking the scenic route. `` I ca n't imagine <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> passing up anything adventurous,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> commented.

 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> was president of civic groups and donated time to causes _ to all appearances a well-to-do, community-minded woman. One son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, was a commodities broker and columnist for a local business journal. The other, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, lived on a farm outside town. But all three now are being held in an Austrian jail, fighting extradition to face charges they ran a marijuana-smuggling ring so big that authorities say the people hired to count money were told to not bother with $ 1 bills. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> and her sons left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985, two years before their November 1987 indictment. They were n't arrested until May _ <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> was released but re-arrested this month after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government protested _ and attorneys on both sides of the case say it could be years before they are tried. `` At this point it's completely in the hands of the Austrian government,'' said Deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thar </PERSON>. `` Obviously, I would feel better if I were in control, but that's just the way it is.'' Thirty-four people were named in the 136-page indictment outlining what federal authorities said was one of the largest marijuana-smuggling rings ever uncovered. It allegedly touched 11 Midwestern states and moved at least 250,000 pounds of marijuana; employees counted as much as $ 15 million at a time. The family knew it was under investigation _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON> had testified before a grand jury _ so `` it was n't terribly surprising that they fled,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. `` Anybody that has that much money and knows there is an investigation is a likely flight suspect.'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and her staff bided their time, waiting for officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to process hundreds of pages of documents at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, translate them into German and move them through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The three were first arrested May 24 in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> under the International Convention of Narcotics. There is no U.S.-Austria extradition agreement. `` They had no indication they were going to be taken into custody,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pylitt </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> attorney representing <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>. `` I have no idea what the Austrian government is going to do in this case.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, who shares a home near <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> with his wife and two children, `` believes if he returns to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> he will not get a fair trial,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Pence </PERSON>, his attorney here. `` The attitude toward drugs is such that it clouds everyone's minds as to guilt and innocence.'' `` We're very hopeful the Austrians will give them their release,'' Pence said. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not flee, he did not leave that country at all. He knew an extradition request was pending. He's not going to flee.'' <PERSON> Pylitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pence </PERSON> said they did not know if <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> had an attorney here. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of federal authorities, but to all appearances they were unlikely criminals. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, 58, had been president of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> and the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Jewish Women. She was `` an outstanding community citizen,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a family attorney who was acquitted in March of money-laundering and conspiracy in the case. `` She did a lot of things for the community. She was in every organization,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` She was in leadership positions. She gave the position of being a well-to-do, community-spirited person.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, 35, was a `` very charming, bright guy,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> added. However, authorities say <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> led the ring in partnership with a man Thar identified as <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, an escapee from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Prison. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was one of three lieutenants immediately under the two partners, <PERSON> Thar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> helped manage money laundered by dummy companies in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The indictment says the ring imported at least 140,000 pounds of pot in 1985 alone, storing it on a farm in northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and near <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. When robbers stole 6,000 pounds from the farm, eight employees were given voice stress tests. The loss ultimately was absorbed by the Heilbrunns, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and unindicted co-conspirators <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocksdale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to distribute marijuana, money-laundering and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> faces 26 counts, including conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana and running a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, 38, faces nine counts. However, they could not be prosecuted on 21 tax-related charges if they are extradited under provisions of the International Convention of Narcotics. Eight of <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>'s counts are tax-related, as are 10 of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s and three of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s. `` We're in the waiting process,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who nonetheless is happy with other results in the drawn-out case. `` I think we've been real successful. We've convicted everyone we've gotten our hands on. The people who've fled to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, there was nothing we could do to stop that, and we have every reason to believe they'll be extradited.''

 <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, sensing a need for `` transactional immediacy,'' figured to meet the challenge with a 24-hour-a-day `` vertical format'' in a basic cable milieu. In other words, a comedy channel that you do n't have to pay extra to get. Beginning in November, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> will premiere on basic cable systems _ viewers wo n't have to buy <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> to get it. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> executives said they would announce later this month how many cable systems will carry it. The channel's format is still sketchy, but the plan is that it will offer quick bites of stand-up comedy, movie clips, stage bits and some full-length films. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, which has been bread and butter to a lot of comedians with its `` On Location'' shows and `` Comedy Experiment'' series on <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>, has already signed a number of comedians to develop regular bits and programs for the new channel. They include <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Poundstone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> will get a head start on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, which also announced a 24-hour comedy channel, <ORGANIZATION> HA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, which is scheduled to premiere early in 1990. It's format, too, is still in the planning stages, but will probably more resemble <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, with `` comedy jocks'' introducing material. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, explained to a group of TV critics meeting here that viewers have demonstrated a need for `` transactional immediacy.'' `` Consumers want what they want when they want it,'' he said, citing the popularity of microwave ovens and VCRs, for instance. Beahrs envisions viewers watching a favorite network series, cable show or movie and suddenly getting a nagging feeling that, in the motto of the Comedy Channel, there might be `` something funny going on'' over there. Zap. Faster than instant coffee in a microwave oven, they have switched over to the Comedy Channel for a quick chuckle. The `` vertical format,'' he explained, just means you only get one format, such as all news on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> and all sports on <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>. The advantage of comedy programming, he said, is that it can be tempered to meet the time of day. But at no time of day will there be any R-rated language or subject matter, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, executive vice president in charge of programming for the Comedy Channel. This is, after all, advertiser-supported basic cable, not pay TV where viewers choose to get the material by paying extra each month. There will be no <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinisons </PERSON> or other comedians who depend on working `` blue,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>. In fact, he insisted that the Comedy Channel will not be `` the stand-up channel.'' `` While there certainly will be some stand-up comedy, we hope to be associated with a more human, open and relaxed kind of comedy. A lot of stand-up is more aggressive, almost violent _ ` I have the microphone ... I'm gon na make you laugh,''' <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said. A promotional tape showed comedians as hosts of regular features who talked directly to viewers and sometimes interviewed people on the street a la `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Beahrs </PERSON> said at first HBO planned to make the channel about 50-50 short bits and long-form programs, but cable operators said there was too much competition in long-form programming. Now the channel will be about 85 percent short bits, he said. As for the comedy clips from movies that <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> wanted to include, that turned out to be a snap. Movie studios jumped at the chance to promote movie sales and rentals by letting viewers get a teasing glimpse of some of the best bits. A promotional tape of what the Comedy Channel might look like included, for example, a snippet of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in `` The Man With Two Brains,'' when a police officer pulls him over and gives him the world's most rigorous drunk-driving test.

 Upstaged by political turmoil, `` The First Emperor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' had a quiet start instead of a gala premiere for its filmed re-enactments of Chinese history and spectacular views of the Great Wall. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilization </ORGANIZATION> has been attracting a lot of attention since the 40-minute documentary opened there July 4. `` There's obviously a disappointment on both our side and on the Chinese studio side,'' <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howells </PERSON>, the film's Canadian producer, said about downplaying the movie's promotion. The $ 5.8 million movie in the huge Imax format is the first major attraction at the Cineplus theater of the new Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilization </ORGANIZATION>. But its part in the June opening celebration for the museum was delayed to avoid controversy. Regular screenings of the film in English and French, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s two official languages, began July 4 on the theater's 87 - by 62-foot screen In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the American Museum of Natural History took the movie off its summer schedule because of the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Basically, I feel the film has to be shown,'' <PERSON> Howells </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I look at it as a joint venture between a lot of Chinese workers and artists and Canadian filmmakers.'' `` The First Emperor'' is the first Imax film made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the first to place the emphasis on dramatic scenes rather than the showy travelogs known to visitors to Imax theaters in museums and special exhibitions. It is a co-production between the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Xi'an Film Studio, which approved the script. The documentary tells of <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihuang </PERSON>, who built the Great Wall of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but whose dynasty lasted only three years after his death in 210 B.C. In its retelling of the emperor's career, the film notes that books promoting freedom of thought were burned. `` The burning of them enraged the intellectuals of the day. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> also had a solution for them,'' the narration, written by Chinese screenwriter <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ji </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, says. `` He buried 460 of them alive. The criticism stopped.'' The film otherwise is mostly filled with scenery and pageantry, which works better in the large Imax format than the few intimate scenes that tend to be stilted on a screen geared to spectacle. In addition, to the Great Wall, the documentary also shows some of the terra cotta army of 7,000 life-size statues that <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> left in his tomb. The site was discovered in 1974 by some workers digging a well in <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province, and the Canadians making `` The First Emperor'' were the first foreign crew allowed to film there. <PERSON> Howells </PERSON> said the collaboration of the Canadian and Chinese crews, filming from Oct. 30 to Feb. 13, was a big project and not an easy task. He said, however, that in retrospect those involved `` will say we did n't have any real major problem.'' He attributed most of the difficulties to confusion arising from translating and interpreting mistakes, or simply cultural differences. `` We'd meet every day at the end of the shoot of that day and sort out the problems,'' he said. As for logistics, among the props were 3,200 weapons, 40 chariots and some artifacts from the Qin dynasty. There were 11 studio sets, including a seven-story royal palace, and 20 locations. Nine Canadians and 368 Chinese were working on `` The First Emperor'' at the height of production. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> produced the first Imax film for <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s Expo'67. With Imax, there's a high focus and ultra-clear picture, and sound comes from many directions. Seats are in curved rows and at a steep incline, so viewers get a full perspective and are made to feel like they're actually in the motion picture. The system since has spread to other countries, and more than 60 theaters now exist to show the films made from outer space to the deep sea. Although the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> takes credit for the idea of doing a documentary on Qin, it says the Chinese decided that the pageantry and spectacle would be best suited to an Imax production even though the first theater had yet to be built there. The first Chinese Imax theater was planned for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Straw </PERSON>, former lead singer for the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palominos </ORGANIZATION>, has a lot more than music on her mind _ like dinosaurs and ants. She keeps maps and pictures of dinosaurs around her apartment. And she wo n't step on ants because she ca n't stand the idea of harming living creatures in any way. Music is her life, but when she picks up a newspaper, the science section is opened first. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> often wonders about extinction and erosion, what will happen to the world. She feels the same way about people, priding herself on the diverse group of musicians she assembled for her debut solo album, `` Surprise.'' `` I bend over backwards to make sure the people playing for and with me are enjoying it and feeling good,'' <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> said. `` That's probably my maternal instinct. ... I feel like I have to sign everything. Whatever it takes to launch this ship, my ship of fools.'' The cast of dozens include <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON>. She had high praise for them all, citing <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> as a `` guitar visionary,'' Parks as making music `` too beautiful for this world'' and <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> as `` Mr. Ace Guitar.'' `` I feel like I worked with the best. I went straight to the people I wanted. I do n't abuse people. I think that's why some of these incredible people would be willing to have something to do with me,'' she said. A steady band would make life simpler for <PERSON> Straw </PERSON>, but she sacrificed stability to play with the musicians of her liking. `` I must have claustrophobia,'' <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> remarked. `` I like an open window, I like an escape route. I like to know I can go. If I found a band that had time to commit to me and me alone, that would be a tremendous sense of security. Unfortunately, I like to play with people who are in demand already'' Dinosaurs are not mentioned in `` Surprise,'' but <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> draws on a wide range of influences, singing rock, pop and country. `` Chasing Vapor Trails -LRB- His Turn to Cry -RRB-'' is the long-awaited answer to <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s 1960s teen smash, `` <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s Turn to Cry.'' `` Sphinx'' features <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s guitar playing, and the `` happy-go-luck accordion'' of <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> recorded `` Almost Magic,'' co-written by former bandmate <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON>, with a 103-degree fever, completely blacking out at one point. She closes Side 1 with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s traditional ballad `` Hard Times,'' and Side 2 with another slow song, her own `` Golden Dreams.'' `` I like to rock, and I like to give the impression of being a sensitive soul also,'' she said. `` I thought a lot about the song order. It's not quite accidental that both sides end in a similar way. I want to leave people thinking.'' On `` Crazy American,'' she sings: `` Any place I hang my hat is someone else's home.'' The lyrics recall her years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when she depended on the kindness of friends and strangers for shelter. `` I did n't live anywhere for years. ` OK, I'll live in your apartment for two weeks.' ` Oh, you're coming back nine days early? You'll be here in 10 minutes? Fine.' That is a pretty common situation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A lot of people sort of live around like that,'' she said. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON>, whose parents were both actors, grew up in <LOCATION> Montrose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where she enjoyed playing hide-and-seek in her neighbors' yards, and sitting on a wall singing <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s `` Heart of Gold. She headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after high school, taking acting classes and managing several walk-on appearances on `` Saturday Night Live.'' Hearing a local singer perform one night inspired <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> to take up music herself. `` Music saved my life, it gives me a raison d'etre,'' she said. `` I would n't want to be a non-musical person. I am so musical every minute of my life. I have trouble with people who do n't give a damn about music. Usually, they do n't give a damn about animals, either.'' Her career began to pick up at in late 1985 when she met drummer <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fier </PERSON>, mastermind of the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palominos </LOCATION>, at the Bitter End nightclub. `` I'd say sparks were flying, some kind of friction was in the air. We kind of took each other and started jousting. That night he walked me home and said, ` You want to sing on my record?' I said, ` Maybe,' and I did.'' She learned quickly to be ready for anything with the Palominos, singing rock, country and avant-garde with an everchanging band behind her. After two albums, `` Visions of Excess'' and `` Blast of Silence,'' <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> left the group to start a solo career in 1987. `` Anyone as motivated as I am would feel very frustrated; it was n't enough to live on,'' she said. `` I like being in control of my own music. Previously, I had to answer to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> because it was his group. He was the one mixing. Now, I'm the one behind the board.''

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> profits by others' mistakes. Slices, hooks, duffs or sinkers _ whatever golfers call their misdirected shots _ the sound of balls plopping into water hazards is sweet music at the world's largest distributor of used golf balls. Riding the sport's surge in popularity this decade, International Golf scuba divers are expected to retrieve 10 million golf balls this year for redistribution everywhere from golf-crazy <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to the hills of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, birthplace of the game 800 years ago. The number of balls rolling into the plant is five times more than the company processed in 1985 and more than all gathered by its few competitors, says the concern's president, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>. `` When you think of all the golf courses and all the people hitting balls into ponds, we have no idea how far this could go,'' said <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>. The company is now straining the limits of its plant and directors are discussing a first-time public stock offering to help pay for expansion. `` Think about it, every golfer loses balls and they could have a piece of a company that makes money getting them out,'' said <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>. `` They'd say, ` Well, I lost $ 100 in balls, but maybe I'll get some of it back.' The recent success of International Golf sometimes boggles <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, whose first boyhood job was making 8 cents a ball combing water traps in nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. He later spent $ 1,500 of college tuition money from his father on scuba gear and devised a weekend circuit to collect balls in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. Fraternity brothers seeking a piece of his profits would face a unique job interview. `` I'd put them under a freezing cold shower for 10 minutes,'' he said. `` Not many of them made it.'' <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> returned to his father's furniture business following college, but the entrepreneurial urge was too strong. Through the'60s and'70s he launched several golf-related retail enterprises. Each time business foundered, he turned to golf ball collecting to bail himself out. The break came last year when <ORGANIZATION> Merimac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based venture capital firm, started to bankroll the company and brought in consultants to overhaul management. Now, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> pays more than $ 500,000 a year for the rights to collect balls at about 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courses. Meanwhile, golf is taking off like a solid tee shot. The Florida-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, says 23.4 million people played at least one round of golf last year, up from 15.1 million in 1980. More than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, bringing the total to more than 13,000. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, there are an estimated 12 million golfers and 1,600 courses. International Golf does not release sales figures, but <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> said it's now a multimillion-dollar operation that ships balls throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and many countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It takes about 3.5 million balls to break even, he said. The backbone of the company is its 45 divers, who earn between $ 500 and $ 1,000 a week plunging into the murky and debris-clogged water traps. Broken glass and rubbish are just some of the hazards facing divers as they grope along the bottom in silt up to four feet deep. Alligators have also bitten at least two divers. `` There is no glamour to this job,'' said diver <PERSON> Theron </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, whose flipper was once pulled off by an alligator. `` There is zero visibility and I've run into everything down there: rakes, dump trucks, golf carts and shopping carts. It's kind of like catching bubbles in the dark.'' On a good day, a diver can pull up 600 balls. They are then shipped by truck to the plant. <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>'s modest office is decorated with a few golf posters and a sail fish he caught as a teen-ager. The arm rests of his swivel chair are torn. The view is the barb wire-ringed courtyard, where 1.5 million balls are bagged and waiting to go through the assembly line. First, the balls are washed and immersed in chemicals to remove algae and barnacles. Next, they are inspected for quality and imperfections. Cuts are surprisingly few due to the high-impact Surlyn jackets on most new balls. The highest grade balls are packaged and sold for about half the price of manufacturers' new balls. The lesser quality balls are repainted and sent to driving ranges. Even those with cuts are sent to luxury cruise ships to be blasted into the sea from deckside driving ranges. `` I'm having a wonderful time,'' said <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>. `` We were all working so hard we never looked up to see how things were going. Then one day I looked at them loading pallets to be shipped to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ and I thought, ` I used to pick up balls with my toes.' It's pretty amazing.'' <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON> says his company is still a relatively minor player in the $ 462 million-a-year golf ball market, but while other companies have their eyes on the green, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> is left along to scour the ponds. `` We're not one-to-one competitors with the big guys yet,'' said <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, `` but at least we're one of their little headaches.''

 Of all the strategic errors people make when they invest their money, financial advisers say, by far the most common is to have no strategy at all. For many individual investors, this problem arises not so much from ignorance, laziness or disorganization, but rather from the ordinary vagaries of day-to-day life. Investments in stocks, mutual funds and other securities tend to be made at unpredictable intervals _ say, when a lump-sum payment is received, when a bank time deposit matures, or when investors happen on some idea that strikes their fancy. In many cases that's only natural. The typical small investor's savings and investment holdings are put together one piece at a time Unless they come into some windfall such as an inheritance, few people are in a position to create a $ 50,000, $ 100,000 or $ 500,000 `` portfolio'' with the wave of a checkbook. Granted, the experts say, but even those investors who have accumulated substantial sums in their accounts often sit with a patchwork of holdings that fit no overall pattern. This can leave them in a poor position to pursue their financial goals, and vulnerable to risks they never intended to take. `` Most investors buy one stock or bond at a time, without considering how it will affect the structure of the overall portfolio,'' observes <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatter </PERSON>, an analyst at the Cleveland-based brokerage firm of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Nearly all investors understand diversification,'' he adds. `` Nearly all investors believe diversification is worthwhile. But almost no one does anything about it.'' In its weekly publication The Outlook, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> summarized the problem: `` The best way to build an investment portfolio is with a well-conceived plan. `` A portfolio that is a haphazard mixture of stocks, some of which have been bought on hunches or tips, is unlikely to produce satisfactory results over the long term.'' <PERSON> Slatter </PERSON>, who has long experience examining the holdings of customers who ask for advice, says he sees some common tendencies: `` In a typical portfolio, there are too many public utilities _ often 40 percent or more. In many instances, there are too many bank stocks and oil stocks. `` Those seem to be the industries that appeal to the vast majority of investors. Yet there are at least 75 industries to choose from, some of which have done far better than utilities, banks or oils.'' Utility and bank issues may attract _ or have attracted in the past _ people looking for conservative stocks with relatively high yields. However, as <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P points out, in the world of the late 1980s, investors who have a large percentage of their money in such stocks may find themselves over-exposed to the risks that come with wide fluctuations in interest rates. In the same vein, <PERSON> Slatter </PERSON> says, many people with ties to a large company through their jobs, their family or their communities wind up with a great chunk of their savings in a single stock. `` In most cases those investors are unwilling to part with a single share, even when that one stock makes up 80 percent of the portfolio,'' he notes. `` They seem to ignore the fact that any stock can go down.'' Who qualifies as a `` beginner'' investor with a need for mapping out a diversified strategy? It could be someone who has just sold a house or business, received a bonus or hit the lottery. Or, says S & amp; P, `` he or she may equally be someone who wants to start a focused investment program after years of dabbling in the market.''

<HEAD>Follow-up Audits Find Many Reform Ideas Ignored Until Scandal Broke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing and Urban Development offices across the country waited nearly a year to reform a program identified as ripe for fraud, acting only as reports surfaced of abuse and political favoritism at the agency. Follow-up audits show that most regional offices initially ignored recommendations made in a June 1988 audit report. The report said poor accounting and failure to oversee private closing agents hired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had cost the agency millions of dollars in potential losses in its single-family housing program. The reports were compiled in the past month and obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> through the Freedom of Information Act. They say most regional offices initially resisted changing the program before finally implemented reforms in the past few months, a period coinciding with numerous published accounts of mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The June 1988 national audit was based on a series of local reviews conducted by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s regional inspectors general. They found an alarming number of instances in which the private closing agents had failed to reimburse <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> after selling properties or else sent the government the money days, weeks and months late, costing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> millions in interest. Ten such agents are the subject of criminal investigations; <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials believe their actions cost the agency about $ 20 million. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in one of his first memos to regional administrators and field office managers, angrily criticized those who had failed to implement the suggested reforms. `` These problems reflect a failure to meet the department's basic management responsibilities and leave us vulnerable to fraud and monetary losses,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in the June memo. `` I will not tolerate this and I expect each of you to take personal responsibility for dealing with these issues immediately. Performance evaluations and job security will depend upon on how these reforms are promptly implemented and enforced.'' A month before <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> wrote his memo, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s regional administrator in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, wrote all of that region's closing agents and informed them of new accounting procedures _ warning that those who violated them would be terminated from the program. The auditors of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> office praised that action but noted <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s action came nearly a year after the initial audit found numerous problems with the office's administration of the single-family housing program. In the interim, according to a follow-up audit completed late last month, the agents under his office's jurisdiction continued to send the government its money more than six days late on average. The auditors also uncovered nearly $ 200,000 owed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from agents who had handled sales for the agency but had not sent in the proceeds. The situation was much the same in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the site of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regional office that has figured prominently in the scandal. Of 256 sales files examined by auditors, more than half, 145, had no confirmation that the agents had wired the government its money. `` HUD has no real assurance that sales proceeds were actually sent,'' the auditors said. One of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> region's closing agents, the auditors said, had placed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money in several bank accounts and potentially was earning interest that should have been placed in escrow accounts. `` The deficiencies discussed were permitted to occur because the region failed to set up and follow the proper procedures to effectively and efficiently monitor the closing agents,'' the auditors said. That was the case despite the 1988 report calling for a series of new monitoring and accounting controls over the agents. The follow-up audit of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>' single-family property program found similar results: 63 of 68 cases involved late payments to the government, more than $ 250,000 of unremitted proceeds had gone undetected and one closing agent wrote checks for cash on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> accounts. By failing to improve its internal controls, the auditors said, the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> office `` unnecessarily increased <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s vulnerability to losses. Not all the news in the follow-up reports was bad. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, auditors found agents were sending <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s money in on time, with only a few delays that were beyond the agents' control. Auditors said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> still could do more to oversee the closing agents but noted a marked improvement in processing. Those offices where problems persist will be hearing from <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> again soon. `` In the absence of measurable improvements within 90 days, you will be asked to meet with senior headquarters' officials to explain why such improvements have not been realized,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in his recent memo. `` These reforms are essential for us to gain proper financial control. Anything less is not acceptable.''

 Less than two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s restrictive abortion law, battles have erupted in at least a half-dozen states in a preview of the war to be waged next year in legislatures across the country Versions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law have been introduced in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and are being drafted in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling has revived a long-dormant court battle over a law banning abortion. Anti-abortion legislators in at least 25 other states have begun planning legislation based on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s law, and abortion has suddenly become a major issue in governor's races in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` It is going to be the major issue of 1990,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, a pro-choice Democrat who is exploring a possible run for governor. `` There's no in-between on this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on July 3 upheld a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that banned abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees from counseling women about abortions. It also required doctors planning to perform abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks to determine if it could live outside the womb. Many observers expect the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to take up other abortion issues in its fall term, and possibly to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. But even if the court goes no further than the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case _ <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ it will have dramatically altered the political landscape in almost every state in the country. `` We really have to recognize that what <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> has done is reopen the abortion battle,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Balch </PERSON>, the state legislative coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Of 13 legislatures that may hold further sessions this year, <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> says battles over abortion were likely in seven _ <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. He declined to characterize the prospects for change in those states or in most of the other states that likely will reconsider abortion laws next year. However, he did say Right to Life expects its most difficult battles in the 13 states that provide financing for abortions for poor women _ especially <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The states most likely to enact further abortion restrictions are <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> already has the most restrictive abortion law on the books, a statute making it a crime to perform an abortion. However, the law has lain dormant since 1976, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge issued an injunction stopping the state from enforcing it. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling encouraged <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> to ask a federal court judge to lift the injunction. His request has enraged abortion rights activists. `` <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is a major battleground,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedler </PERSON>, director of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is the first state to try to criminalize abortion, even without grounds to do so.'' In <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, brthplace of the latest round in the abortion struggle, Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> announced plans the day of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling to appoint a task force to explore ways of further restricting abortions. Other states are convening committees and beginning political dialogue that is intended to reach some sort of consensus on abortion. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said he would ask the Legislature for restrictions on abortion, but wanted to `` consult with a broad range of Iowans'' first. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> announced formation of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> committee to study the issue. And in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> said he will launch `` the great debate'' in September by convening a committee of the entire 80-member Assembly to question witnesses and consider bills on abortion. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, who is against abortion, said he probably would ask the Legislature to consider abortion restrictions if another special session is held later this year. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he would call a special session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in October to consider abortion bills. `` Clearly, I believe the unborn ought to have more rights than they have right now,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe we ought to wait until 1990 to deal with a difficult subject. It's not something that's going to go away.''

They include measures modeled after the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> statute and other bills that would require girls under 18 to obtain the consent of both parents to get an abortion and would propose a state constitutional amendment prohibiting state employees from receiving abortions under their state health insurance plan. <LOCATION> MINNESOTA </LOCATION>: The <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> started a campaign to urge Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> to call a special session solely to enact abortion restrictions.

Abortion has become a major issue in the fall governor's race. <LOCATION> NORTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CAROLINA </LOCATION>: A bill modeled after the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law was introduced months ago but is lying dormant in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. The sponsor, state Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stam </PERSON>, said he will wait until the 1990 session to push it. <LOCATION> OHIO </LOCATION>: House Speaker <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Riffe </PERSON> said he is considering naming a committee to study <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s abortion laws and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> decision. One bill introduced July 6 by state Rep. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a pro-choice advocate, proposes that abortions be allowed up to the 25th week. At least one anti-abortion bill is in the works. <LOCATION> OKLAHOMA </LOCATION>: Conservative legislators plan to introduce bills next February to restrict abortion at least as much as in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> PENNSYLVANIA </LOCATION>: State Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said he will introduce legislation that would restrict abortions in line with the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> ruling, but said he did n't have a timetable for introducing the bill. <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CAROLINA </LOCATION>: Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> said they will propose legislation in the fall, when bills can be pre-filed for next year's session, to graft some of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> laws onto existing statutes. SOUTH DAKOTA: Law already bars use of state funds to pay for abortions not needed to save a woman's life, but legislative leaders expect a bill next year that would impose a 20-week viability test similar to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s. <LOCATION> TEXAS </LOCATION>: Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, who is against abortion, said he probably would ask the Legislature to consider abortion restrictions if another special session is held later this year.

However, the Legislature and Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> are considered strongly pro-choice. So far, 46 of 150 lawmakers have signed a statement supporting abortion rights. <LOCATION> VERMONT </LOCATION>: Abortion is an issue in the fall governor's race.

Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> supports a constitutional amendment to ban abortions. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: The state attorney general is analyzing the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> decision to determine whether it applies to a 1970 voter-approved law that restricts abortions to the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. The state had been operating under the assumption that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> superseded that law. WEST <LOCATION> VIRGINIA </LOCATION>: State Delegate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said he will introduce a bill for the January legislative session that would parallel Missouri's law. <LOCATION> WISCONSIN </LOCATION>: A bill is before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> that would require parental consent for minors' abortions.

 As much as 10 percent of the world's gross national product may be spent on computers and computer-related equipment by the year 2000, says the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee.

<HEAD>Brokerages Expected To Post Strong Quarter As Retail Activity Up</HEAD>

 Declining interest rates and increased stock activity have boosted activity at Wall Street's investment houses, which have struggled in an industrywide recession that has included layoffs and restructuring. Much of the renewed optimism, which should be reflected in improved second-quarter profits at major brokerages, is based on a return of individual investors to a stock market tarnished by the October 1987 crash. `` We see much more interest in individual securities, whether stocks or bonds, which obviously would bode well for the industry,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markese </PERSON>, research director for the 110,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Thursday. A rise in June in merger activity and in fees generated by underwriting new issues of stocks and bonds _ two key indicators of <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>'s health _ should lift industry profits compared with the first quarter, when some firms lost money, analysts said. `` Without a doubt it's going to be one of the better quarters for the industry,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <LOCATION> Salomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION>, earlier this week announced that its second-quarter earnings would be the company's best ever, exceeding the $ 190 million earned in the first quarter of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said the first half of 1989 for the firm would be `` only modestly below'' that of first-half 1988, when it made $ 253 million, or $ 1.68 a share, on revenue of $ 3.04 billion. Earnings forecasts for other firms also are optimistic: 40 cents to 50 cents a share for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, compared with 31 cents a share in the first quarter; $ 2.60 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, up from $ 2.02 for January to March; and about 50 cents a share for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after nine months of losses. But analysts caution that profit levels are n't even close to the boom times that preceded the stock market crash and say many of the factors that led to thousands of layoffs and retrenchment on Wall Street remain. `` You ca n't just throw up your hands and say we've turned,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, a securities industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We may still be in a recession three months from now on the Street.'' The expected improved results are being attributed to a steady decline in short-term interest rates that has prompted some investors to transfer money from money market funds and bank certificates of deposit to investments with higher returns, generating more trading profit for the firms. For instance, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s one-year bill had a yield of 8.10 percent at the end of June compared with 9.58 percent at the end of March. Some money market interest rates, which fetched over 10 percent earlier this year, recently dipped below 8 percent. Declining interest rates mean investment banks pay less to borrow money to finance inventories of fixed-income securities. Also, brokerages typically receive much higher commissions on investment vehicles other than CDs and money markets, including retail trades. Higher stock trading volume also means more commission business. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s average daily volume in June was 180.3 million, the highest in a year and third-highest in any month since October 1987. Merger and acquisitions and securities underwriting activity both jumped in June, providing additional fuel to the strong quarter, statistics show. The total value of announced acquisitions in June was $ 37.7 billion, the second-best month this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks industry data.

<HEAD>BAT War Underscores American Dominance of Takeover Battles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The takeover battle for tobacco-retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> is developing into a U.S.-style fight, underscoring the American dominance of the worldwide corporate buyout scene. The hostile, $ 21 billion offer from an investor group led by Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> certainly is American-sized. It would be the second-largest takeover in the world after the record $ 25 billion purchase of U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. It would be four times the size of the previous biggest British bid. The bidders offer no cash and instead are using an American financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>: junk bonds. Both sides have lined up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers: leading American investment bankers. In addition, many of the battles are expected to take place on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil: in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts and before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance regulators, due to BAT's ownership of American insurance companies. `` If you're sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out what the defensive strategy would be, you would figure they would use American advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass and get the best ones,'' said <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, a director of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patricof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. London-based BAT, a diversified conglomerate, has wide-ranging interests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> It owns <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s department stores. Forty-one percent of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-tax profit and 30 percent of its revenue came from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last year. The bidding group, which includes British investor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, an Australian entrepreneur, launched the bid Tuesday through a newly formed company, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. BAT immediately rejected it. On Thursday, BAT said it dropped a planned $ 400 million note issue, which was to have been completed Monday. It would have been one of the biggest Eurobond offerings ever by a non-American company. `` The issue has been withdrawn following the disruption of the market for these securities as a result of the Hoylake bid,'' BAT said in a statement. It said it wanted to protect investors, who it said would have faced substantial losses because of `` the hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid.'' `` Now that BAT is under siege,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, `` they are merely taking a prudent route.'' BAT's shares fell 15 pence, or about 24 cents, to finish at 862 pence, or $ 14.05, Thursday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The bidding group's offering price is 850 pence, or $ 13.86 a share. Junk bonds, such as the ones the Goldsmith group is offering, are not as widely used or accepted in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where high-debt ventures are less common. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk securities. Also new to the relatively staid <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> takeover scene would be the breakup of such a large company. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said he wanted to `` unbundle'' BAT by selling its non-tobacco interests. In the BAT war, the offense has lined up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> junk bond pioneers <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s financing pros. Its legal advisers include <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law firm on the takeover forefront. The defense quickly enlisted <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to help <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plot its strategy. All three are American brokerages. American investment firms, which are particularly aggressive, have been leaders in developing sophisticated takeover and anti-takeover techniques. BAT's defense likely would be a management buyout, said <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>. `` I'm sure that it would be led from the <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and therefore by having <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> advisers they would have a more direct line to the cash.'' Of course, Americans do n't have the lock on the takeover market. Both sides' armies include powerful British firms. BAT has <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> and Co. The bidders have <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON> and Co.

 A federal bankruptcy judge has rejected a creditor's motion to close the financially troubled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>. The motion by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was denied Thursday on procedural grounds by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, the court-appointed trustee for <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W. In their motion, the creditors had sought to close the CM & amp; W on the grounds that it is continuing to lose money and has no reasonable prospects of reorganization.

He did say, however, that the creditors were opposed to the deal with <PERSON> Wertheim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroder </PERSON> as it now stands. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> also ruled Thursday that the railroad may continue to use revenues until Aug. 31 to pay for operations, and that <ORGANIZATION> CM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W may draw more loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the creditors planned to appeal the latter decision.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>' a annual inflation rate held steady at 8.3 percent in June, and may have reached its peak, the government announced Friday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s retail price index rose 0.3 percent in June from May, the Department of Employment said Friday. Market forecasts had called for a 0.5 percent gain. The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 115.4 in June, compared with 115 in May and 106.6 in June 1988. `` Inflation may now have reached its peak,'' said Employment Secretary <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. `` It is set to fall as the measures taken by the chancellor begin to work through.'' Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> has pushed up interest rates 10 times _ to 14 percent from 7.5 percent a year ago _ in an effort to combat <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s resurgent inflation. The annual inflation rate stood at 4.6 percent in June 1988. If mortgage interest payments were excluded, the latest inflation rate would have been 5.9 percent in June, <PERSON> Folower </PERSON> said, This compared with May's 6-percent rate, excluding such payments. The June rise in the index reflected higher prices for food, catering, alcoholic drinks and motor vehicles, the department said. The increase also reflected a continuing rise in housing costs, it said.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Everything from hand-carved ivory elephant tusks to office furniture and even the kitchen sink heads for the auction block this weekend as federal regulators liquidate some 20,000 items seized from failed savings and loan associations. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is hoping the four-day auction, which begins Saturday, will raise some $ 500,000. Proceeds will go back to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of putting a dent in the government's cost of bailing out the defunct institutions, a cost estimated last year alone at $ 40 billion. `` What you see are the signs of success that turned out to be the products of failure,'' auctioneer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` It's continuously surprising.'' The auction is the first of four the agency is planning. Another is scheduled for next month in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and the third will be in September again in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The fourth one is not yet scheduled. Among the 20,000 items are four large wooden elephants _ two about 5 feet tall and two others slightly smaller _ that at one time were kept in an Austin savings association office. Bargain hunters this weekend will get to pick from the carcasses of 34 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls _ 32 from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and two from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> _ that were placed in receivership last year, casualties of the energy and real estate collapse earlier in the decade. Bids will be taken on everything from 30 cars and trucks, including a 1957 <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, to bank safes, desks and chairs, countless calculators and typewriters, computer terminals, paintings, sculptures, Japanese vases, a Persian rug and the three hand-carved ivory elephant tusks. The <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> does n't run. Of the two kitchen sinks in the inventory, one likely will work. It's still in its original box. `` This is a sign of the old times and once the cleanup is complete, hopefully we wo n't see this again,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pace </PERSON>, manager of receivership activity for the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, said while surveying the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> warehouse crammed with the items up for bid. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> said it had received $ 1.5 billion from asset sales last year, about $ 925 million from sales of non-real estate assets. Through May, the agency, which insures thrift deposits of up to $ 100,000, had liquidated another $ 309 million in assets and hopes to receive $ 5.9 billion in income over the next five years. Officials expect several thousand people to participate in the bidding. In the first couple of hours Thursday that the warehouse was open for public inspection, at least 300 people had signed up. `` We're trying to outfit an office,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Steege </PERSON>, who works for a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oil and gas company, said as he inspected an executive desk set. `` We're hurting. So we're looking for a bargain.'' `` I've bought office equipment at auctions before and come out good and bad,'' added <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, a wholesale insurance broker. `` When you buy it at 5 cents to the dollar, you can afford to come out bad once in a while. We've finished our whole office this way.'' But <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who works for a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> estate management company, was less than impressed. `` Ninety percent of this is junk,'' she said. `` ` Obsolete' is a kind word.'' Pace kindly labeled the polished wood elephants `` more or less an oddity.'' He would not speculate on whether they would command a good price. `` We've had some people from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> call and hopefully they'll be interested,'' he said.

 Eight people, including three former presidents of financial institutions, have been charged in a $ 30 million loan fraud and kickback scheme that helped force the closure of the institutions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say. `` The crimes committed in the boardrooms of the nation's thrift and banking institutions have cost the taxpayers of this country billions of dollars,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday. `` In each case in which we have investigated failed or troubled financial institutions, we found that insider fraud was a component of that failure,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. Those indicted were: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosch </PERSON>, 51, of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellyn </PERSON>, former president of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON>, which was placed into receivership by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in 1985; <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuer </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beloit </ORGANIZATION>, placed into receivership in October 1986; and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, placed into receivership in 1986.

The eighth person, attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzak </PERSON>, 40, of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellyn </PERSON>, a former associate of <PERSON> Rosch </PERSON>, was charged in the case, but not indicted. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources today as saying <PERSON> Pietrzak </PERSON> was expected to plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution. <PERSON> Rosch </PERSON> faces the stiffest maximum penalties if convicted _ 150 years imprisonment and fines of $ 7.5 million, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Rosch </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halprin </PERSON>, said his client had been cleared of similar charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and he planned to pleaded innocent in this case. The indictment accuses <PERSON> Rosch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heuer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and others of conspiring to run a group of lending institutions through a pattern of racketeering activity involving repeated acts of mail and wire fraud.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is returning to it roots in the agricultural equipment market with farm implements featuring Cat's trademark rubber-track system in place of tires. Independently built combines and grain auger trailers, equipped with the unique Caterpillar rubber-track systems, will be available next month for the first time. It signifies a major push by <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> into agricultural equipment, which was the foundation of the Peoria-based company. Caterpillar was formed in 1925 when two leading manufacturers of agriculture equipment merged and moved to <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. `` We became better known as a manufacturer of construction equipment and lost our identity with the agriculture industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, supervisor of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s agriculture section `` But we've maintained a presence with our steel-track tillage tractors and now we're going to go after the tillage tractor business more aggressively than in the past.'' Caterpillar signaled its interest in the farm machinery market in 1987 with the introduction of its Challenger 65 farm tractor _ the first farm vehicle to feature the rubber-belted tracks, which run the length of the machine just as the steel tracks run under many <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> bulldozers. Although the rubber-track system is about 20 percent more expensive than tire-based tractors, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said the rubber-track system is superior. `` The track system provides more even weight distribution on the ground, meaning there is less soil compaction and better crop yields,'' <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said. `` It has much greater traction than flotation tires and it's more fuel efficient. With the rubber tracks, it can go down approved roads at comparable speeds as tires.'' <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said farmers who convert to a track system are more productive because they can maneuver in muddy fields when tire tractors are mired. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON> said the company's `` <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trac </ORGANIZATION>'' system will start showing up in more farm fields carrying equipment produced by <ORGANIZATION> Claas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and grain auger trailers built by <PERSON> Kinze </PERSON> Manufacturing of <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> `` We are really excited about the product,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reindl </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Claas </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. `` We have a significant head start over the rest of the industry. Before our competition has equal technology, we'll be working on phase two.'' <PERSON> Kinze </PERSON> grain auger trailers fitted with rubber tracks will be available at 200 dealers by Aug. 1, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Heick </PERSON>, company marketing coordinator. <ORGANIZATION> Claas </ORGANIZATION> expects to have combines featuring the rubber tracks ready by late August at a handful of dealers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating with more than a dozen agriculture equipment manufacturers for similar usage of the track system under implements that would be used in tandem with <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s Challenger 65 farm tractor, which runs on rubber tracks. The company says it has sold 600 Challengers since the model debuted in 1987 and sales are three years ahead of projections. Its re-entry into the agriculture market would pit it against <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the free-world's leading agricultural equipment manufacturer based in <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>. Ironically, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> sold its line of farm combines to <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> in 1935 when it decided to focus on construction equipment. `` The one thing that keeps us all hopping ... is competitive pressure,'' <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said. `` Deere will have to respond. We watch each other ... and it helps to spur technological advances.'' <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON> said his company bought a Challenger to study the competition but is not developing a track system of its own. `` We evaluated the track technology but determined it was not a desirable feature for our equipment,'' <PERSON> Coombs </PERSON> said. `` We're very comfortable with the technology we've developed and are using.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, eager to score an initial victory for its strategy to reduce Third World debt, has offered <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a temporary loan of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion to help it close lengthy negotiations with commercial bankers. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its commercial lenders have some sticky issues to resolve and that no deal was in sight. `` The quality of the solution is more important than the timetable,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters a few hours before the economic summit of seven major industrial democracies opened here. Mexican officials, he said, want to `` get it done correctly rather than trying to rush it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a hastily arranged meeting this morning with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who is attending festivities marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> also has met with some other summit leaders. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the test case in the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach to the Third World's $ 1.3 trillion debt problem, has been holding closely watched discussions with its commercial bankers to try to restructure its portfolio of foreign loans. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said Mexican and bank negotiators were `` very close'' on terms for an agreement but that they had been stuck on a few key points for almost a week. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> confirmed a report in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that to sweeten the prospective deal, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has offered to make a so-called bridge loan to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion. `` We are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to complete the agreement ...,'' he said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has received similar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loans in the past to ease its financial difficulties until fresh assistance from commerical banks became available. A bridge loan is considered an inducement for bankers to make a deal because the new money allows a debtor nation to continue meeting its interest payments on foreign loans. A little more than half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s total foreign debt is owed to commercial bankers, many of them American institutions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to wrap a deal as soon as possible to show its summit partners that its new approach on the debt, drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, can work. But <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> emphasized that `` there is no requirement to leave the summit ... with an agreement'' and that an artificial deadline might hurt the quality of the final agreement. Walking into the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> gestured to reporters that a debt agreement was near. Afterward, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his Mexican counterpart, `` Let me know on all this other stuff down the road.'' The Bush-Salinas meeting came as more than two dozen leaders of rich and poor nations marked today's 200th anniversary of the French revolution. Getting under way this afternoon was the annual economic summit of the world's seven richest democracies _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The combined events have brought together leaders of some of the world's richest and poorest nations, although there were no plans for them all to sit down together to thrash out world problems. Smaller meetings were planned, however, to discuss such pressing issues as the foreign debt of the developing nations. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> wasted no time Thursday in asking French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to call a summit of rich and poor nations so they can talk about international economic and environmental problems. Brazilian President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> also has pressed his country's case with foreign officials <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are the developing world's two biggest debtors, with combined foreign loans of more than $ 200 billion. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> met Thursday with <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a day after talks with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' southern neighbor, has often led efforts to bring an end to the Third World debt crisis, which dates to 1982 when that country was unable to meet its loan payments. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met informally with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> to discuss debt rescheduling and the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> leader's ideas for `` debt for nature'' swaps, according to <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. Under a swap arrangement, some foreign loans would be forgiven in exchange for promises of environmental protection. At the economic summit, Uno plans to pledge nearly $ 40 billion for debt relief and environmental aid for developing nations, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, who earlier in the week briefed reporters in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. He wants to increase <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` recycling of funds'' program for the debtor nations by $ 35 billion, which will include $ 5.5 billion for the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan. The recycling of money refers to the government's effort to use capital from its trade surplus to help poorer nations. In addition, $ 2.25 billion will be set aside for projects to preserve the environment and study environmental problems.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has recalled nearly 1.8 million of its full-sized and luxury cars because of a problem with an automatic cruise control that could hold the throttle partly open, hampering a driver's effort to slow down. The automaker took the action Thursday after the National Highway Traffic and <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last March began a formal investigation into the problem which could have led to a government-ordered recall. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said the problem is not related to so-called `` sudden acceleration,'' which some had alleged was linked to cruise control mechanisms. Nineteen models built between 1984 and 1988 are involved in the recall. They include 1.73 million cars with 5-liter gasoline engines and about 18,000 cars with 4.3 - and 5.7-liter diesel engines with Cruise Control III systems <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it has received 354 complaints from owners of the vehicles, including 28 crashes and 13 injuries allegedly resulting from the problem. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries as a result of the problem. `` There may be an honest difference of opinion regarding what is the potential problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyden </PERSON>, `` but we are cooperating fully with <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> and we're moving forward to address our customer needs.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the agency said the problem stems from a small plastic ring which can slip out of place, causing the throttle to remain partially open while at highway speeds, making it difficult for the driver to slow down. Owners will be notified by mail and repairs will be performed at no cost to the customer. Models included in the recall are: _ <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 88, 98 Regency, Custom Cruiser, <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> and Toronado _ <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabre </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Electra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wagon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and Regal _ <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> G </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parisienne </LOCATION> and Grand Prix _ <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caprice </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Cadillac </PERSON> <PERSON> Brougham </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorado </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British brewer <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> will pay an extra 85 million pounds, or $ 138 million, to former <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to settle a dispute stemming from its takeover of the liquor company, the <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> On </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Takeovers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Guinness acquired Distillers for 2.53 billion pounds, or $ 4.1 billion, in 1986. The takeover panel, a self-regulatory body which oversees bids involving British companies, said <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> would pay the difference between its official 630.3-pence a share, or $ 10.21, offer to <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' shareholders and the 731 pence per share which <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> paid separately for shares through a Swiss company acting on its behalf. The purchases made at the higher price were found by the takeover panel to be in breach of British regulations. They and a number of other alleged irregularities have become known as the `` Guinness affair.'' Seven men involved in the takeover, including then-chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, face trial on criminal charges related to the case. The payments to shareholders are `` in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said. The panel said that <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who had accepted <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' cash offer would be paid another 100.7 pence a share plus interest charges of 10 percent a year. Compensation also will be paid to <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who acquired <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> shares in accepting <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' alternative cash-and-shares offer and sold them prior to the official completion of the bid. <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who did n't accept either offer yet sold their Distillers shares for less than 731 pence before the official completion of the bid would also be compensated, the panel said. The panel said <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> estimated the cost of the compensation could total as much as 85 million pounds.

<TEXT>
 The descendants of the log cabins of the American frontier are gaining popularity in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as well as at home. Not the rough-hewn logs and mud-floored types of yore, though. These are the modern, sleek versions _ made of precisely cut pieces of wood and coming equipped with modern conveniences, including jacuzzis and saunas. And the increasing popularity of log homes, both at home and abroad, could pep up north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s forest products industry, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON>, president of Fireside Log Homes in <LOCATION> Ellijay </LOCATION>, one of 14 log home makers in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and one of the nation's largest. Last year, Fireside produced 250 log homes, ranging in price from $ 19,600 to $ 42,800. And Mahaffey estimates that exports of the log homes could make up as much as half of Fireside's volume by 1992. According to Log Home Living, a magazine that tracks the industry, 452 American log homes were exported last year, including 390 to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Overall, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry's 466 manufacturers produced about 14,353 homes last year, 2,533 fewer than in 1987. Sales by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers increased to $ 413.4 million in 1988 from $ 401 million in 1987, the magazine said. <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON> leaves next week for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to unveil a 1,000-square-foot log home that Fireside developed especially for the Japanese market. `` The Japanese are fascinated with solid-wood-wall construction,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, program director of the <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` For one thing, wood is very scarce in that country. Apparently, it's a status symbol.'' But <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON> said many Americans still perceive log homes to be drafty fire hazards that are susceptible to termites. The industry is trying to change that image. Officials say log homes, because they are built of solid wood, are able to retard fires better than conventionally built houses. And a log home's thick walls provide better insulation and thus are more energy efficient, they say Many of today's log homes are built from machine-made kits, although a few are still handcrafted. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupferer </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Log Home Living, warns buyers that all log homes require more maintenance than conventional houses in the first two years after construction. `` Until this whole mass of wood settles and shrinks and acclimates itself, you need to keep the exterior maintained with a preservative, and you need to keep the cracks filled, otherwise they fill with moisture,'' he said. <PERSON> Kupferer </PERSON> said the industry is selling larger houses. He noted that the domestic log-home market is shifting from first-time home buyers to existing homeowners moving up to larger residences. `` In the late 1970s and early'80s, we built a lot more houses than we do today,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, sales manager at <ORGANIZATION> Mountaineer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Log </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, which now produces about 50 homes a year, most of them custom-made. `` There was a tremendous amount of small cabins then. But we have gone from the secondary home to the primary residence.'' Where the typical Mountaineer home once was 800 to 1,200 square feet, it now is 1,500 to 5,000 square feet, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We just finished one that is 6,700 square feet down in <LOCATION> Snellville </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I like wood, I like wood interiors,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, 68, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cobb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>. He owns a 1,680-square-foot, three-bedroom, two - bath log home on Walnut Mountain near <LOCATION> Ellijay </LOCATION> `` A log home breathes,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said, `` and you get better circulation and better and even temperatures in a log home.'' According to Log Home Living's latest survey, most log home owners are middle-aged, college-educated professionals who have at least two children. About 43 percent have annual incomes of more than $ 40,000. Some 84 percent use their log homes, which average 1,872 square feet, as their primary residence.

 Wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in June, the first drop in 18 months, driven down by steep declines in energy and food prices, the government said today. The slight decline in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Producer Price Index surprised most economists, who were expecting a moderate increase of 0.3 percent, and marked a sharp turnaround from the big 0.9 percent jump in May. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June _ their first monthly back-to-back drop in more than two years _ as consumer spending remained sluggish, particularly for cars and other more costly durable goods. And the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reported the operating rate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories fell in June to 83.5 percent, while industrial production dropped 0.2 percent, further easing concerns about inflation but providing more evidence of a slowing economy. Energy costs, which had soared more than 20 percent over the first five months of the year, fell 3.1 percent in June, the biggest drop in three years. Food prices fell 0.8 percent, the steepest in a year and a half, reversing an identical increase in May. Despite the overall decline, economists were likely to read mixed signals from the June report because goods other than food and energy rose 0.7 percent, the largest increase since October 1986. Because food and energy prices swing widely from month to month and are less influenced by the economy as a whole, analysts look to the inflation rate of other goods as an indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Despite the drop in the index last month, wholesale inflation for the first half of 1989 hit a fast 7.6 percent annual pace, nearly double last year's 4 percent rise. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said prices of tomatoes and celery, which had doubled in May, fell sharply in June. Vegetables overall fell 8 percent last month, following a 26.4 percent rise in May. Other food catagories posting declines in May were: pasta, 9 percent; fish, 7.3 percent; chickens, 5.2 percent, and beef and veal, 3.8 percent. Prices rose for pork, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, fresh fruit, eggs and candy. Energy costs fell across the board with drops of 8 percent for fuel oil, 4 percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas. The department said the increase in other categories was driven primarily by a 5.8 percent jump in cigarettes and other tobacco products and for ships. Prices for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, soaps and furniture also rose, while prices for flatware, women's clothing, jewelry, glassware and cosmetics declined. The overall June decline left the Producer Price Index for finished goods one stop short of retail at 114.1, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 in 1982 would have cost $ 114.10 last month, 10 cents less than in May but $ 6.40 more than a year ago. The news from inflation measures earlier in the production process was also good. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.2 percent in June after rising only 0.1 percent in May, while crude goods dropped 2.0 percent following a 0.9 percent rise. An example of the three processing stages would be finished _ bread; intermediate _ flour and crude _ wheat. Most economists believe inflation will continue to moderate over the next several months, but they're divided over the long-term outlook. Analysts point out that much of the price spurt earlier this year was fueled by a once-and-done run-up in crude oil prices in the spring. Now that oil has stabilized at the $ 20-a-barrel level, energy prices should n't be contributing to inflation for a while, they believe. Also, even though food prices have jumped around a bit this year, it is clear there will be no repeat of last year's drought in most of the nation's grain-growing regions. `` Therefore, the PPI should remain relatively well-behaved over the next several months,'' predicts economist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Between March 1988 and March of this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> fought to curb demand, and thus inflation, by boosting interest rates. However, the economy has clearly slowed so far this year and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has permitted interest rates to decline. Early in June and again last week, the central bank nudged a key interest rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, down by a quarter of a percentage point. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in advance of today's report that if inflation turned out to have moderated last month and if other government reports today on retail sales and industrial activity in June confirmed the slowing trend, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers might be inclined to ease credit another notch before the end of the month. `` I think the chances of getting another easing are good. But, just as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was cautious in going up, they're going to be cautious in coming down,'' <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> said.

 The stock market edged upward today in a hesitant response to a fresh barrage of statistics on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,544.20 in the first half hour of trading.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 27.09 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Several reports from the government this morning lent support to the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's factories, utilities and mines Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent. However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left market participants without an unequivocal signal of slackening inflationary pressures, analysts said. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> rose \ to 49 and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> gained -RRB- to 42 -RRB-, but <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LRB- to 114 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 112 \ The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .22 to 184.53.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has offered <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a temporary loan of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion to help bring to a close an agreement with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks on debt restructuring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said today. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> and bank negotiators were `` very close'' on terms for an agreement. The loan is contingent on an accord between the country and its creditors to reduce and rearrange $ 54 billion in existing loans. However, some outstanding issues remain and no deal is in sight, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` The quality of the solution is more important than the timetable,'' the White House official told reporters a few hours before the opening of the economic summit here. According to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, Mexican officials want to `` get it done correctly rather than trying to rush it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought to sweeten such a deal between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the banks by providing a so-called bridge loan. `` We are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to complete the agreement ...,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in confirming the report. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met this morning with with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. The two are attending the 200th anniversary celebration of the French Revolution. Such loans are sometimes used to assist a country hampered by paperwork delays following debtor loan negotiations with foreign bank creditors. More than half of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s total foreign debt is owed to commercial banks, many of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Mexican government has said it would want to reach such an agreement before accepting new loans. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has indicated it would like to wrap up an accord as soon as possible, a sign to the other summit nations that it has adopted a new approach on the debt. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> stressed that `` there is no requirement to leave the summit ... with an agreement'' and that an artificial deadline might hurt the quality of the final agreement.

 The stock market advanced slightly today in a hesitant response to a fresh barrage of statistics on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 98.26 points over the past eight sessions, rose 5.12 to 2,543.44 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 60.37 million shares at midmorning.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Dip Following Ferruzzi Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices fell in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following a federal court ruling upholding an exchange order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract. Other grain futures markets showed no clear direction. Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking to block the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency order, which <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> claimed was aimed at weakening its market position. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has denied it tried to corner the soybean market. The Board of Trade said it issued the directive Tuesday to ensure an orderly expiration of the July contract, which goes off the board next Thursday. The exchange said that without the forced liquidation of positions, there might not have been enough deliverable soybeans to satisfy all the July contracts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s request to block the order, saying the potential harm to public confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> would surpass any monetary loss by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>. In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.91 -LCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent lower with July at $ 2.56 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with July at $ 1.48 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 7 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 6.90 a Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were stronger in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 71.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with July at 47.32 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .45 cent higher with July at 29.40 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Thursday while pork futures were mixed.

 Two employees at a non-union coal mine were struck by gunfire today in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and a car bomb exploded at a coal company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, authorities said. Two <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees were replacing windows on a guard shack at its <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> mine when they were hit by shotgun pellets, said state police spokesman <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. One of the workers was struck several times in the face and the other was hit in the shoulder, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The workers were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> but their names and conditions were n't immediately available, he said. No arrests were immediately made. In the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> incident, a bomb went off in a car parked at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this morning, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had no other details. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> and company spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> were in a meeting at the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> office building, a secretary said, and could not be reached for comment. About 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members went on strike April 5 over a contract dispute against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> company in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. Other union workers began staging sympathy strikes June 12 throughout <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Today's violence comes one day after police arrested hundreds of striking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members and supporters in <LOCATION> Prenter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for blocking the road to a non-union mine and pickets in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> injured the president of a coal company and a driver Coal companies accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> of letting the protests get out of hand. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> `` may know how to run an insurance company, but he damn sure do n't know how to run a state,'' said <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> is a millionaire insurance executive <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> A.T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> should call out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> `` before it is too late.'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> for not controlling violence. A Caperton spokesman said the governor and state police are in control of the situation and intend to remain neutral. Col. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckalew </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state police, on Thursday placed all 486 troopers on around-the-clock duty. The UMW this week authorized a weeklong work stoppage affecting 60,000 miners east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in what it said was an effort to calm coal field tensions and allow negotiations to resume. Before the work stoppage, permitted by the union's contract, about 37,000 miners were off the job in eight states. In <LOCATION> Prenter </LOCATION>, 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, state police on Thursday arrested 277 of the 500 strikers who blocked the road leading to the operating, non-union <ORGANIZATION> Elk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said state police spokesman <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Elk </PERSON> <PERSON> Run </PERSON> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>. The miners were charged with obstructing a road, a misdemeanor, and one was charged with resisting arrest. They were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, where they were issued traffic tickets and released. While <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the Prenter protest was peaceful, violence has erupted in the coal fields in the past few weeks. At <ORGANIZATION> Sidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Sidney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, company President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Snavely </PERSON> was hit in the face with a rock, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coal </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Massey </LOCATION> subsidiary <PERSON> Snavely </PERSON> was treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Williamson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Trucking </PERSON> said one of his drivers, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, was slightly injured when pickets at <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coal </PERSON> threw rocks.

In another development, a federal judge who has fined the union nearly $ 1 million for violating his strike restrictions postponed a hearing in <LOCATION> Abingdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on additional penalties. `` We agreed that if this matter is continued there might be a chance for both parties to calm down,'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Passino </PERSON> said of the union and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Peril of `Junk' Commercial Paper Shown By Integrated Resources' Default</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As if junk bonds were n't enough for investors to worry about, now the spotlight has been turned on yet another high-risk, high-yield security: junk commercial paper. The perils of this form of corporate debt were pointed out recently by the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate and investment company that defaulted on $ 955 million in short-term obligations, including its commercial paper. Complicating matters is that <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial paper was not rated as junk, or high-risk, until after the company's financial problems came to light last month That means investors saw their investment-grade Integrated Resources commercial paper turn into junk in a matter of days. However, most small investors have little to worry about. Their only exposure to commercial paper would be through mutual funds and pension funds, and the risk to these investments is small, experts say. One type of mutual fund, money-market funds, invest in large amounts of investment-grade commercial paper, but most are barred by federal law from purchasing low-rated commercial paper. The major mutual fund operators do their own credit analysis before they make any investment, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipper </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks the mutual-fund industry. That kind of examination keeps Integrated Resources paper out of the portfolios of most of the largest fund operators, including <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. These fund operators said Integrated Resources never met their investment standards despite its acceptable ratings from the credit rating agencies. `` We would n't have even considered it,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwitz </PERSON>, a Price vice president. `` It had been in a negative cash-flow situation for years.'' One exception is <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a mutual fund operator that held <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> paper in one of its money market funds. Value Line said the investment represented about 3.8 percent of the fund's net assets. Market professionals have placed the amount at $ 22 million to $ 24 million; <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> would not reveal the figure. Value Line said last week that it had bought the paper from the fund, which eliminated it as a risk to the fund's investors. <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> said he believes other funds had invested in Integrated Resources paper, but <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> has been the only one to publicly acknowledge it. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> and Price, among others, also said they never invest in junk commercial paper for any of their mutual funds. Junk commercial paper is a small subset of the $ 450 billion commercial paper market, used by companies to raise cash for short-term needs. Commercial paper with investment-grade ratings is considered a relatively safe investment. Companies issuing it usually have high ratings on all their debt obligations due to their strong financial positions. Commercial paper is a form of short-term corporate IOU usually not secured by assets, though it is supposed to be backed by bank lines of credit. Companies sell the paper to raise money for periods ranging from a few days to a few months. The reasons for issuing commercial paper vary. Some companies use it to tide them over until proceeds from a bond issue arrive. Others use it for working capital or to provide cash until funds from regular operations come in. Companies find commercial paper attractive because the interest rates they must pay on it usually are lower than bank-loan rates. Commercial paper also provides flexibility in the length of the loan. Junk commercial paper, by contrast, is issued by companies that are deep in debt or have low debt ratings for other reasons. Its yield is higher than investment-grade paper because of the added risk to investors. The safety of the investment-grade commercial paper market is reflected by its history. Only one issue has defaulted since the early 1970s, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuire </PERSON>, an executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. That issue was <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for bankruptcy-court protection over asbestos-related lawsuits. <PERSON> McQuire </PERSON> said he did not have figures on the number of junk-paper issues that have defaulted. But while the track record of investment-grade paper is excellent, the Integrated Resources case shows it is not a foolproof place to put money.

 <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees today said they had unsnarled a procedural knot that had threatened to stall a $ 157 billion taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses. After balking Thursday night at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer of a comprehensive package addressing major differences in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the legislation, the chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiator, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, agreed today to several of its provisions. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reviewed a broad outline of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal overnight. Today he said the two sides are `` so close on an overwhelming majority'' of issues that he will draft a counterproposal on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` ` My intention is to provide a starting point for an overall settlement,'' he told the five <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators. `` I believe this provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse.'' But <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s chief negotiator as chairman of its banking committee, acknowledged that the two sides remain far apart on one issue: how to finance the bailout Nonetheless, both expressed optimism today that enough of an agreement could be reached by the middle of next week to have a bill ready for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature in August. To minimize the bailout's impact on the federal deficit, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> want to raise the $ 50 billion immediately needed to close some 500 insolvent S & amp; Ls and cover the losses of their depositors through private 30-year bonds. Citing potential interest savings totaling $ 4.5 billion over 30 years, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has demanded that the money be borrowed directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, a move that would swell the deficit by a total of $ 44 billion in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991. `` That will remain the key outstanding issue to be debated,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> conferee. In the meantime, <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> agreed to proceed with negotiations today on how much new capital the government should require S & amp; L owners to invest in their businesses as a buffer against future losses of federally insured deposits. `` We're not very far apart,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he was prepared to accept several provisions in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill that impose tougher regulatory requirements on some S & amp; L operations, and he was willing offer compromises on others. Earlier, he had described the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s offer as `` aggravating'' and a `` horrendous injustice'' to a previous agreement to consider hundreds of differences between the two bills item by item. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said that step-by-step approach would `` take until Christmas'' to get a bill acceptable to both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as well as the administration `` It's to the advantage of all concerned to open the deck and put all 52 cards on the table face up,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> issued a statement from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> saying the administration would `` strongly support'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer, but wanted to review its details. Administration officials, meanwhile, worked furiously behind the scenes Thursday night to prevent votes on specific issues. The dispute brought to the surface major procedural differences in the way the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have addressed the S & amp; L crisis and the bailout _ the largest in history, with an estimated cost of $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 per taxpayer. Both <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> are new to their respective banking committee chairmanships. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s 21-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee met behind closed doors last spring, negotiating compromises on most issues _ including several provisions to benefit specific companies _ before voting on it in public as a package. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> had his 51-member panel put the House version together entirely in open sessions. He called the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer Thursday an attempt to avoid taking stands on specific items in the package that might offend industry and other constituencies. `` For the first time, there is a spotlight on them, everybody is watching, and they're not used to that,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` They're used to getting behind closed doors and cutting deals, but that's where all the mischief has been Among other key elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offer are: _ Acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to require S & amp; L owners to risk $ 3 in real, tangible capital for every $ 100 in lending by Jan. 1, 1995 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill had provided a laxer standard of $ 1.50. _ A compromise limiting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L ownership of junk bonds to 6 percent of their assets The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had wanted to require S & amp; Ls to sell their junk bonds within two years, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill has a more liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets. _ Adoption of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> clause guaranteeing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> the right to keep his job for the next two years and retain his authority over state-chartered S & amp; Ls

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees violated state law by repossessing up to 1,300 cars and trucks without giving owners adequate warning that they missed their payments, a lawsuit contends. The class-action lawsuit filed by the state consumer advocate charges that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees ignored a state law that requires written notice explaining to a car or truck owner that he has a 20-day grace period to make good on a missed payment before the vehicle is repossessed. Vehicles were sometimes repossessed with little more than a telephone call to warn owners that they missed payments, state Consumer Advocate <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> said in his suit filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Richland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The suit also alleges that employees of the Detroit-based finance company deliberately flouted the consumer-protection law and sometimes faked office records to make it appear that they had not. <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> said it appeared that the consumer-protection law was skirted so employees could cut down on paperwork. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the allegations and will cooperate, a spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said the company contacted <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>'s office after an employee in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> complained in May about the way some repossessions were being handled The lawsuit asks that a judge forbid <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> employees from continuing to break the consumer-protection law, even though <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said the company has stopped the violations. The lawsuit also seeks some kind of `` adjustment'' for the owners of the 1,200 to 1,300 vehicles that <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> claims were illegally repossessed over the last five or six years. <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> said he did not know what form the `` adjustment'' would take. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> will `` do whatever we have to do to try to reach a fair and equitable settlement,'' <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> has offices in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> counties, but <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said the problems were centered in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> office.

<HEAD>U.S. to Lift Punitive Fee on European Hams</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is lifting its punitive 100 percent tariff on bone-in hams from the 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations because they have allowed the shipment of some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat not treated with hormones, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said Friday. The amount involved is small _ the Europeans have been shipping only about $ 300,000 worth of the hams annually _ but it is an easing of a conflict between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the community over hormones in meat. The move followed the acceptance by the community of a small quantity of veal offals -LRB- variety meats -RRB- from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We continue to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on meat produced with hormones is entirely unjustified,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said in a statement. The community banned from Jan. 1 the sale of meat from animals treated with hormones to fatten them. In retaliation, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration imposed an extra 100 percent tariff on European shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of products with a value roughly equivalent to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat exports halted by the ban. One of the products was bone-in ham. A joint European-American task force agreed in May on shipping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat not treated with hormones, and to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation to the extent that American meat could be sold.

<TEXT>
 Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June _ their first monthly back-to-back drop in nearly two years _ as consumer spending remained sluggish, particularly for cars and other more costly durable goods, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 140.8 billion last month following a 0.1 percent decline in May. The May figure was revised downward from an 0.1 percent increase originally reported last month. Sales had risen 0.4 percent in April and 0.1 percent in March. It was the first consecutive monthly decline since 1987 when sales fell 0.8 percent in September and 0.9 percent in October. Retail spending accounts for about one-third of economic activity and is closely watched as a measure of the overall economy. Economic growth has been slowing recently, prompting concern that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to contain inflation could move the economy into a recession instead of the `` soft-landing'' it seeks. Spending on durable goods _ big ticket items such as cars and home appliances that are expected to last more than three years _ has been particularly affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit-tightening measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said durable goods sales were off 1.3 percent in June after falling 0.5 percent in May and rising 1.8 percent in April. Auto sales plummeted 2.0 percent in June after falling 1.8 percent in May. It was the biggest drop in auto sales since a 4 percent decline in October 1987. Sales had risen 2.0 percent in April _ a month of large dealer incentives. Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales. Excluding the automotive category, overall retail sales rose 0.1 percent, following hikes of 0.4 percent in May and 1.2 percent in April. Sales of home furnishings fell 0.1 percent after rising 1.1 percent in May. Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent last month, the same increase as in May. They had risen 0.6 percent in April. Department store and other general merchandise spending was up 2.1 percent. Also showing increased sales in the non-durable category was apparel sales, up 1.9 percent. Non-durable categories posting declines included: food stores, down 0.7 percent; gasoline stations, down 0.5 percent; restaurants and bars, down 0.2 percent and drug stores, off 0.3 percent. For the three months from April through June, overall retail sales were up 5.3 percent from the same period in 1988.

<TEXT>
 An Italian agribusiness firm said today it will go to court to recover losses resulting from an order by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> forcing soybean traders from holding positions potentially large enough to corner the market. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanzaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, made the announcement in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. He reiterated the company's position that the accumulation of soybean contracts was legal, adding, `` <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> and all major world traders are convinced that the board made a mistake and has to suffer the consequences.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> did n't specify the amount of losses suffered as a result of the board's order. But it said damages could be calculated in part as the difference between the closing market price of $ 7.26 a bushel on Tuesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> issued its order, and the price during the days through July 20, when all soybean traders must reduce their holdings to a maximum 1 million bushels. A spokesman said the suit probably would be filed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but did not give a timetable. The company also indicated it might seek compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage to its reputation. One day earlier, a federal judge denied a request by two <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ for a restraining order and a permanent injunction ending the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION>'s directive. Published reports have said the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> was the object of the directive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> on Thursday denied the injunction request, saying the harm to public confidence in the Board of Trade from the injunction would surpass any monetary loss by <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it turns out to be a mistake, -LRB- then -RRB- a possible default in the market, a loss of confidence in the market could be a consequence,'' <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> said. CBOT <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>'s decision `` reaffirms that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to ensure the orderliness of the market and to effect the orderly liquidation of the July soybean contract.'' Soybean futures prices fell in early trading today in reaction to <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>'s ruling. The July contract opened at $ 6.90 a bushel, 7 -LCB- cents below Thursday's settlement price. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest market for grain and soybean futures, issued an emergency order requiring any player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for July delivery to reduce those holdings to 1 million bushels by the end of trading next Thursday, when the July contract expires. In issuing the order, the exchange cited federal regulations that allow it to take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a futures contract. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit claimed it had been irreparably injured by the order, which it said would diminish confidence in the market and hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers. In arguments before <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> acted `` arbitrarily and capriciously'' and in bad faith when it issued the order. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> noted that the exchange ignored the fact that the market has been trading in a very narrow range in recent weeks, an indication that there was no squeeze or cornering of the market. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angle </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>, argued that there `` is absolutely nothing in the record to show this action resulted from bad faith tantamount to fraud on the part of the CBOT.'' Angle said <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> could appeal the emergency order to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the CBOT. Although he refused to grant an injunction, <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>'s action may not have been totally defensible He said <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> could sue and be adequately compensated for any loss in monetary damages if it proves its case. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, said he did not know whether the Italian firm would pursue the lawsuit or seek monetary damages. <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> told attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit by Tuesday, with a response due July 24. During the hearing before <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said the emergency order forced the Italian firm to reduce its holdings of July soybean contracts by 20 percent on Wednesday and another 20 percent Thursday. In related developments, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> called for an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s directive and the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> agriculture commissioner asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to check whether <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials may have benefited from the effects of the order. Soybean futures gained Thursday on news that <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> had requested the restraining order, with the July contract closing up 10 cents at $ 6.96 a bushel. The market closed at $ 7.26 a bushel Tuesday before the CBOT liquidation order took effect.

 The stock market turned downward today, retreating in the face of a fresh barrage of statistics on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 98.26 points over the past eight sessions, fell 10.06 to 2,528.26 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 516 up, 871 down and 543 unchanged. Several reports from the government this morning lent support to the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's factories, utilities and mines Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent. However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left market participants without a clear-cut signal of slackening inflationary pressures, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 7 \ to 142 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the most active <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issue, rose 1 ~ to 64 A judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> ruled against a bid by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> to block Time's planned acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

The layoffs, scheduled for Aug. 14, will leave <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll at about 2,750 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION>, where the plant ranked as the largest local employer and the third-biggest manufacturer in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Last summer, the payroll was about 5,400, officials said. But the company, based in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, began laying off employees because of what was described as slumping demand for its products. Last August, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said it would cut its payroll to about 3,000 workers by February 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the latest reductions were necessary because of declines in sales of side-by-side and top-mounted refrigerator-freezers to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s largest customer.

<HEAD>BAT Offer Pulls London's Stock Market Out of The Doldrums</HEAD>

 The hostile $ 21 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> has pulled <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s stock market out of its recent doldrums by sparking speculation about which companies might be the next targets of takeovers. Share prices have jumped to post-crash highs and trading volume has soared on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as investors have scrambled to place their bets. `` You've got bid fever,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chief equity strategist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The market is `` sizing up every possible target however remote, and taking it higher.'' But analysts said the euphoria could be short-lived. Still, the activity was raising hopes that business in general would pick up in the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the financial district, bringing in more fees and commissions. Investment firms have been feeling the squeeze since the October 1987 stock market crash and following the so-called Big Bang deregulation of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s financial markets nearly three years ago. No one, however, was saying that this sudden takeover speculation was going to be the City's cure-all. `` All the stockbroking houses have tremendous cost problems. It's going to take more of a surge than we've seen to overcome them,'' said an analyst who did not want to be identified `` Competition is pretty fierce,'' she said, `` You will have to have some people drop out.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a banking analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <PERSON> Laing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>, said the excitement `` delays a clean-out of the City.'' On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index gained 15.7 points, or 0.7 percent, to finish at 2,273.7, a post-crash high. The index has risen 78.5 points, or 3.6 percent, since the market closed on Monday, the day before the bid for BAT Industries was announced. Volume amounted to a healthy 771.8 million shares on Friday. By comparison, June's average daily volume was 410 million shares. The hostile bid for the diversified British conglomerate was made by an investment group made up of Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>. They want to break up BAT and sell off its non-tobacco interests: financial services, retailing and paper. Suddenly anything was possible on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the City buzzed with names of other potential targets. They included: _ <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the confectionery and soft drinks group _ <ORGANIZATION> Trafalgar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a shipping group _ <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the liquor company _ Hotel operator <ORGANIZATION> Trusthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a retailer not related to the similarly named <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company _ <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a liquor <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s market has been languishing since the stock market crash, plagued by weak prices and low trading volume. It has not recovered from the crash as well as the other major markets. British and foreign investment firms, which had geared up so eagerly for Big Bang, have found it extremely difficult to make profits. Commissions have declined because of the larger number of players vying for shrinking business. Firms have withdrawn from certain activities, like making markets in stocks and bonds, which had been opened up to them under Big Bang. They also have sought to cut their costs by cutting back staff and salaries. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that despite the pickup in recent activity, `` We retain our cautious stance on the market.'' `` The nature of bid activity is that once that the action and the excitement is out of the way, the market tends to sag back,'' he said. `` Certain stocks are vulnerable in the shorter-term unless another megabid appears in the next few weeks to keep the momentum going.'' The strategist added that profit-taking could accelerate, a development that could depress prices.

 Stock prices were widely mixed today as traders struggled to sort out a new array of statistics on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 98.26 points over the past eight sessions, rose another 10.24 to 2,548.56 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 708 up, 715 down and 531 unchanged. Several reports from the government this morning lent support to the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's factories, utilities and mines Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent. However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left market participants without a clear-cut signal of slackening inflationary pressures, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 6 \ to 143 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the most active <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issue, rose 2 to 64 A judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> ruled against a bid by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> to block Time's planned acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday a 31.5 percent drop in second-quarter earnings, reflecting higher interest expenses.

 Citing financial disarray in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> government, a major bond rating agency cut the state's credit rating Friday for the second time this year, a move that could add millions to borrowing costs. The decision by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to downgrade <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bonds from AA - to A represents a harsh assessment of the fiscal policies of Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the state Legislature. `` The state's economy remains strong, while debt and fiscal management display serious weaknesses,'' the agency said. `` The low state general obligation rating reflects <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's continuing concern about the willingness of the state to adhere to sound fiscal practices and timely financial decision making,'' it added Calls made to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' office were not immediately returned Friday and a spokesman for state Administration and <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashman </PERSON> said there would be no comment. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's ratings are a measure of the risk associated with buying the state's bonds. The lower the rating, the higher the interest rate the state must offer investors to entice them to buy <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bonds. The state treasurer's office estimates that the latest downgrade will cost the commonwealth about $ 2 million in interest payments over the next 12 months. But the combined cost of all the downgrades this year will be at least $ 20 million, said Deputy State Treasurer <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ended its last fiscal year on June 30 with a deficit and unpaid Medicaid bills expected to total between $ 450 million and $ 500 million. Saying it was `` the worst thing I've ever had to do in my political career,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday announced $ 491 million in cuts from the state's current budget. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> voted to raise the state income tax by 15 percent for 18 months to cover the deficit from the past fiscal year and pay old Medicaid bills. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's said it was assessing the viability of the governor's budget package but was uncertain of the legislature's response Democratic leaders in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> have said they will move to override the governor's veto of $ 210 million in state aid to cities and towns. `` With a number of issues still unresolved, such as the amount of local aid and the tax package, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P again observes a lack of timely financial decision making,'' the agency said. S & amp; P had previously downgraded <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bonds from AA to AA-in early June. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, another major bond rating agency, also cut its rating last month. S & amp; P's downgrading applies to $ 4.8 billion of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> general obligation bonds and $ 1.4 billion in bonds issued by various state agencies. In addition, $ 757 million of general obligation notes and $ 710 million of various agencies' notes were lowered from SP1 + to SP1

Most other contract months of the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of crude posted slightly bigger declines. Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange turned in similar performances. The August contract for home heating oil slid 0.11 cent to 49.33 cents a gallon, after rising 0.50 cent on Thursday. Contracts for delivery in more distant months settled with minor losses and gains. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery dropped 0.62 cent to 56.84 a gallon, erasing much of the combined gain of 0.84 cent over the previous two sessions. Smaller declines were posted by other gas contract months. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said there was n't any overwhelmingly bearish news to account for the downturn in prices.

 The dollar gained ground Friday against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar in defiance of a slew of statistics that indicated the economy is cooling off. Gold prices fell sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell $ 6.20 a troy ounce to $ 370.80. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 370.50 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, down from Thursday's late bid of $ 375.50. Four sets of economic figures for June painted a picture of a sluggish economy: producer prices fell 0.1 percent, retail sales fell 0.4 percent, industrial production declined 0.2 percent, and the nation's factories, utilities and mines operated at a seasonally adjusted capacity of 83.5 percent, down from 83.8 percent in May. Typically such news would send the dollar lower on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would continue easing its hold on interest rates. But dealers said the fact that the dollar did n't fall much immediately after the figures were released encouraged players to buy the currency. `` It's the old story of selling on the rumor and buying on the fact,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders sold dollars throughout the week on the expectation that the numbers would be weak `` When they came out and they were weak, everybody was looking to buy back dollars at the same time,'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said. Trading was volatile and heavy, dealers said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the market had `` hidden expectations'' of more dramatic data. He noted that further data due out next week, particuarly the merchandise trade numbers for June, will `` create -LRB- additional -RRB- trading opportunities,'' given the market's `` love affair with numbers.'' Statements coming out of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations also gave the dollar a boost. Comments that the finance ministers are satisfied with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's current level prompted traders to speculate that an even higher dollar might be tolerated. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 139.50 Japanese yen, up 0.45 yen from late Thursday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded higher at 140.40 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 140.85 yen, up from Thursday's 139.45 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6125 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6240 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, one pound cost $ 1.6050, less expensive than Thursday's $ 1.6205. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.9125 West German marks, up from 1.8885; 1.6515 Swiss francs, up from 1.6300; 6.4890 French francs, up from 6.4085; 1,385.00 Italian lire, up from 1,369.50, and 1.1917 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1930. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.9030 West German marks, up from 1.8815; 1.6455 Swiss francs, up from 1.6190; 6.4575 French francs, up from 6.3870; 2.1400 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1155; 1,378.50 Italian lire, up from 1,362.25, and 1.1916 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1922. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 370.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 375.75.

 The stock market ran its July record to nine gains in nine sessions with an afternoon advance Friday as traders sorted through a series of new statistics on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 16.50 to a new post-crash high of 2,554.82, extending its gain for the week to 66.96 points. Since the end of June the average has jumped 114.76 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 819 up, 659 down and 518 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 183.48 million shares, up from 153.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 214.58 million shares. Several reports from the government Friday morning lent support to the widespread view that the pace of economic activity was continuing to slow, fulfilling a primary goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported a 0.2 percent drop in industrial production for June, and a decline in capacity utilization at the nation's factories, utilities and mines Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its producer price index of finished goods dropped 0.1 percent last month. That number came in below advance estimates calling for an increase of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent. However, the producer price index, excluding its sometimes volatile food and energy components, was up 0.7 percent. That left market participants without a conclusive signal of slackening inflationary pressures, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fell 4 -RCB- to 145 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the most active <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issue, rose 2 to 64 A judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> ruled against a bid by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> to block Time's planned acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, but also barred Time from proceeding with its offer for 10 days pending appeals. <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>, which received approval from directors to buy back as many as 10 million of its shares, climbed 1 -LCB- to 68 -LRB-. Other gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 43 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LRB- at 36 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 45 |; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 54 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LRB- at 116 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, up sharply in recent sessions on takeover speculation, fell back 5 to 81 in the absence of any news to back up the conjecture. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 12.17 billion, or 0.37 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .75 to 185.06. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 2.20 to 378.70, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.89 at 331.84 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked up 1.01 to 448.90. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 368.12, up .48.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil magnate <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Friday the best thing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can do to promote the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> natural gas industry is to keep its hands off. `` Energy policy to some is for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give a tariff on imported oil. This I am against _ that is not an energy policy,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> told a conference on natural gas. `` My message to our leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is this: Thanks for decontrol of natural gas. Now leave the industry alone. We can take care of ourselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> spoke at a two-day symposium on natural gas at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> that ended Friday. The conference drew legislators, environmentalists, scientists and energy industry experts. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, founder and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said demand for gas is lagging far behind available supply, making it a bargain alternative to oil-based fuels. `` That's good news for energy security and the environment. That's not good news for the producers _ like me,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said the price of natural gas would have to double from current levels to be as costly as oil. But oversupply has put a stop to exploratory drilling, he said. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, bolstered its natural gas investment before the petroleum market began to sour in 1986. Since 1985, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has doubled its natural gas reserve base to an estimated 2.85 trillion cubic feet, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s market potential could pull the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> petroleum industry out of a slump. He said projects in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could bring <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> more than $ 3 billion in sales revenue in the next five years. `` We're in a downturn because of the oil crash, but we believe natural gas is going to become our golden goose,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said he, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, Jr. and Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., had agreed to form a panel to consult with state legislators nationwide to draft a national clean air plan relying on natural gas

 Fixed-rate mortgages dropped to the lowest point in more than two years this week and in response the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is lowering the interest rate cap for VA-backed mortgages to 9.5 percent. Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 9.82 percent this week, down from 10.03 percent last week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>. The government-created company, which finances the housing market by purchasing mortgages, said it was the lowest weekly average since the week ending April 10, 1987. One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages fell to 8.73 percent this week, down from 8.85 percent a week earlier. Freddie Mac averages do not include special add-on fees known as points. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it was making the change in its rate, which will take effect Monday, to reflect the recent interest rate decline in financial markets. As a service to veterans, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> insures low-down-payment mortgages offered by private lenders and it sets a maximum rate to ensure that veterans are not paying more than rates on privately insured mortgages. The change brings the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> rate to the lowest level in 16 months. The last change in the rate occurred June 5, when it went dropped to 10 percent from 10.5 percent, where it had been fixed since Dec. 19. `` This is certainly good news for the veteran who plans to purchase a home in the months ahead,'' <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said in a statement. `` For many veterans, it means they may be able to buy homes that were beyond their means previously.'' Also effective Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will decrease other maximum rates by half a percentage point, including: graduated payment mortgages, to 9.75 percent; home improvement loans, to 12 percent, and mobile lot and home loans, to 11.5 percent. Economist <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> predicted that fixed-rate mortgages would fall by another quarter to half percentage point by the end of the year. `` That's not a large decline, but every little bit helps the housing market,'' he said. Housing has been one of the softest sectors in the economy this year because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, until recently, has been nudging interest rates higher to curb inflation pressures. Since early June, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has reversed course, pushing short-term rates down by a half a percentage point. <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said he expected a further loosening in short-term rates from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> of a quarter to a half percentage point by the end of the month, but that would not necessarily translate into a drop in adjustable-rate mortgages. `` More and more, the S & amp; Ls that were offering extremely attractive first-year teaser rates are no longer doing so because the federal presence in that industry is discouraging that,'' he said. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which does include points in its averages, said Friday that fixed-rate mortgages averaged 11.00 percent in early June, down from 11.49 percent in early May. It was the lowest since the rates averaged 10.87 percent in December. The most popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage, the type with caps on how high the rate can rise, averaged 10.05 percent in early June, down from 10.28 percent in May. It was the first drop since October.

 Gold futures prices tumbled more than $ 6 an ounce Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commmodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations that investment demand for the metal will fall following government reports indicating an economic slowdown. On other markets, orange juice futures plunged; grains and soybeans were higher; energy futures were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Gold settled $ 6.10 to $ 6.40 lower with the contract for delivery in August at $ 372.20 a troy ounce. Silver was 0.8 cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at $ 5.207 a troy ounce. Analysts attributed gold's retreat mainly to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices in June. The market had been expecting the report to show an increase of 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 0.4 percent drop in retail sales last month _ making for the first back-to-back drop in more than two years _ was also discouraging to gold traders. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s report of slowing industrial production and factory use sent a mixed message to the inflation-sensitive gold market, suggesting both a reduction in inflationary pressures _ which is bearish for gold _ and the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will continue to ease up on interest rates, which is bullish for gold. `` The economic reports were not all that bearish,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demler </PERSON> pointed out that gold prices had risen by about $ 20 an ounce since early June and said that when the wholesale-prices report came out Friday morning, `` traders saw it as an opportunity to take profits.'' Frozen concentrated orange juice futures fell the permitted 5-cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the soon-to-expire July contract, which has no limit, plunged 6.3 cents to settle at $ 1.7135 a pound. Analysts linked the sharp drop to rumors that a large <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> processor planned to cut prices due to a large Brazilian orange crop. Grain and soybean futures prices finished moderately higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on bullish weather forecasts and indications of Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean meal. Soybean traders shifted their attention back to supply-and-demand factors after focusing for two days on wrangling between the exchange and a large Italian company over the exchange's demand that traders reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract. Soybean prices had fallen in early trading Friday following a federal court ruling Thursday evening that upheld the exchange's order Two subsidiaries of the Italian agribusiness firm <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> had sought a court order blocking the directive, which <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> claimed was aimed at weakening its market position. Wheat settled 1 cent to 4 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.95 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.59 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents higher across the board with July at $ 1.50 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 13 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.03 -LCB- a Energy futures finished lower in a light, lackluster session on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower to 14 cents higher with August at $ 20.32 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .06 cent higher with August at 49.33 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .02 cent to .62 cent lower with August at 56.84 cents a gallon. Cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as late profit-taking erased earlier gains linked to stronger cash markets. Pork futures were mostly higher, boosted by strong cash markets. Live cattle settled .17 cent lower to .50 cent higher with August at 71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent lower to .58 cent higher with July at 47.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at 29.37 cents a pound.

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer Friday admitted taking $ 475,000 in bribes from two major defense contractors as he and four other people pleaded guilty in the widening Pentagon procurement fraud probe. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 59, admitted taking $ 400,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and $ 75,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for confidential bid information about a multimillion-dollar contract to maintain the electronic components of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> weapons. The money was paid between 1982 and 1984 into a bank account that <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> kept in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> in the name of a dummy corporation he set up to receive the funds. <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> later transferred $ 400,000 to a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> bank, according to court papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Another former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, 52, pleaded guilty to a bribery conspiracy charge, admitting that he gave a defense consultant bid information about a $ 20 million <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> electronics contract. In addition, two defense consultants and a former marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the successor to <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to separate charges relating to a scheme to conceal illegal campaign contributions to several congressmen, including Rep <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wisc., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> There was no indication that <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> or any of the other congressmen who received donations knew the contributions were illegally funneled to them by <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> through defense consultants. All five defendants agreed to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud that has been nicknamed `` Operation Ill Wind.'' <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, who was a program engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command until his retirement in 1985, is the third former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official to admit taking bribes. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy, receiving bribes and tax evasion, charges that are punishable by a maximum sentence of 25 years and a $ 130,000 fine. Evidence that two major contractors paid <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> $ 475,000 in bribes `` shows a disturbing pattern'' in the nation's defense industry, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told reporters outside the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse here. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> acknowledged that investigators were unaware of <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> until a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official and a consultant for the company pleaded guilty last March and began cooperating with the probe. `` We do not have information that enables us to comment at this time.'' said <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON> <PERSON> Wander </PERSON>. `` There is n't anybody that would be involved in that thing that has n't been thrown out the door or disciplined,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> acquired <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON>. According to court papers, <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, who now lives near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, demanded $ 500,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in return for his influence in helping the company obtain lucrative contracts for computerized maintenance of electronic weapons components. The court papers revealed that the bribery arrangement was approved by an unidentified high-ranking official of <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and was also known to an executive at the company's <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, electronics plant. The Clearwater executive told <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, then a Sperry vice president in charge of the company's Surveillance and <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> Division in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> was ready to retire and `` wanted a nest egg.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to an unrelated bribery charge in March, obtained approval of the arrangement to pay <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> from his superior. Former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> marketing manager <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 42, pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to pay $ 4,000 in illegal corporate campaign contributions to <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, admitted directing private consultants to make the contributions as individuals with money they were paid by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> consultants <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuba </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Mechanicsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarano </PERSON>, 74, admitted participating in the scheme to conceal the illegal donations.

 If <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.2 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fails, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> likely will turn his attention toward another acquisition target _ but observers say he also may have to protect his own company from possible unwanted bids. A <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> judge on Friday rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount is appealing the decision, but if the company fails before the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> says it wo n't pursue the combined <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal effectively precludes any bidder at all and absolutely precludes any bidder at a price near $ 200 a share and that of course includes us,'' Paramount stated Paramount has millions of dollars in expenses from the Time bid to pay off, but the company still has plenty of cash available and analysts expect <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to try to buy another property that would fit in with his expansion goals. When Paramount, then called <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced in April it was selling its consumer finance arm, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the company said it would use the estimated $ 2.5 billion in proceeds to expand its remaining businesses _ entertainment and publishing _ `` both internally through product development and distribution and externally through acquisitions and investments.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> declined to be interviewed Friday and a <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company would not comment on its plans or what its next move might be. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, predicted <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> would be aggressively moving again soon. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' next target likely would be `` smaller and something a little surer than this one,'' <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said Paramount could find itself the object of an unsolicited takeover bid. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, in a meeting with analysts after <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> announced its original $ 10.7 billion bid for Time, said his company always was willing to consider a fair price that recognized the true value of the company, <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. Wall Street traders also see Paramount as a possible target. The company's stock has fluctuated during the course of the Time battle as rumors flew that the company was about to receive a bid. But, <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said, if Paramount does receive an offer, the company is unlikely to be any more of a pushover than Time was. `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is quite a fighter and I do n't think that's what's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said When <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> took over <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western in 1983, the company was a conglomerate that manufactured a variety of products, including bedding, clothes, chemicals, auto and airplane parts, sugar, books and motion pictures. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who began his career at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, had a vision of the company as an entertainment and media giant and he has systematically pared its other segments. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, the company's holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, Madison Square Garden, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> hockey team and the publishers <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, <ORGANIZATION> Prentice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and Pocket Books.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices sagged and long-term interest rates rose in volatile trading Friday as the government reported economic data that were n't weak enough to entice the credit markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond fell 13-32 point, or about $ 4 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, climbed to 8.08 percent from 8.03 percent late Thursday. Initially, evidence of economic weakness furnished by government reports inspired buying enthusiasm in the bond market but the rally soon faded. In two separate reports, the government said retail sales fell 0.4 percent in June and the Producer Price Index dipped by 0.1 percent, the first decline in this inflation measure in 18 months. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production fell 0.2 percent last month while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities used less of their operating capacity. Normally the credit market would welcome signs that a slowdown in economic activity is being accompanied by a moderation in inflation. But <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market had built up hopes ahead of the numbers and pushed up bond prices to very high levels. When the reports merely confirmed widely held views, traders decided to sell and collect profits. `` It's not that the market is falling apart, it's retrenching a little bit from very expensive levels,'' she said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an economist, with <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said the rally fizzled as traders cashed in profits on the belief the recent rally would go no further. He also said the new figures were not weak enough to convince the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates further. `` At the least the next official move is going to be several weeks off at the earliest,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. In addition, he said the market was slowed by news that a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> neared an agreement on a thrift bailout bill that would add $ 50 billion in financing to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> market over three years. With a greater supply in the market, bond prices would likely drop. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell 1-16 point, intermediate maturities were 3-32 point to \ point lower and long-term issues were down 5-16 point to 13-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.96 to 1,189.14. In corporate trading, industrials slipped. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.17 to 329.87. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 94 -RCB-, down -LRB-. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.18 percent from 7.17 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.08 percent as the discount gained 6 basis points to 7.82 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.01 percent as the discount rose 8 basis points to 7.61 percent. Yields on one-year bills climbed to 7.85 percent as the discount gained 3 points to 7.33 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 93-16 percent, down from 95-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Inland Ratifies Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union overwhelmingly ratified a four-year contract offer that improves wages and fringe benefits at <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, according to ballot tabulations Friday. At National, union members voted by an overwhelming 87 percent to accept an offer nearly identical to one they had rejected by 61 percent in June despite a recommendation to ratify from their negotiators. `` A no vote would have meant a debilitating strike that would have destroyed National's productivity and profits for the entire year,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffee </PERSON>, vice president and chief company negotiator. National's 50-month contract provides immediate $ 500 signing bonuses, $ 500 advances on profit-sharing payments and base wage increases of 31 cents per hour. Wage increases totalling $ 1.50 will follow. At Inland, the vote was 7,909 to 586 to ratify base wage increases of $ 1.50, a $ 500 signing bonus, inflation recognition payments, an extra week of vacation and pensions of at least $ 1,000 per month for 30-year veterans. `` The sacrifices, dedication and hard work of our members have helped turn this company around, which is why we were determined to get a contract second to none,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 31 </ORGANIZATION> and the union's chief negotiator with the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker `` We helped mix and bake the pie. Now we're getting our slice. What could be more American than that?'' he said in a printed statement. The new agreement takes effect Aug. 1 and expires July 31, 1983, for 11,500 <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members at Inland's major plant at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> Minorca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and the Inland Lime and <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Gulliver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. National employs about 7,000 union members at <LOCATION> Ecorse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Ill, and <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION> Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, said they have asked a federal bankruptcy judge to approve hourly wage increases of 50 cents for union members at the financially troubled company. Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentz </PERSON> scheduled a July 27 hearing on the issue. The request does not represent the opening of negotiations on a new contract. Rather, it reflects production records that have been set since the current pact was settled in October 1985. The agreement does not expire until <ORGANIZATION> Wheeling-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> emerges from Chapter 11 reorganization.

<HEAD>Pentagon Lifts Suspension of a Teledyne Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on Friday lifted its suspension of a division of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after the firm reimbursed the government and acted to prevent a recurrence of wrongdoing discovered in the `` Ill Wind'' probe of defense contract fraud. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the lifting of the suspension against <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, meant it could again do business with the government. `` The action took effect today,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The suspension was imposed in January when the parent company was indicted. The indictments were based on allegations of wrongdoing by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, three of its then-current employees and one former employee. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and three of the individuals were subsequently convicted, the Pentagon statement said. On March 23, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official pled guilty to charges stemming from the `` Ill Wind'' procurement probe, with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man admitting he took a bribe to provide inside information on a contract. The suspended <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the investigation. For its part, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 4.5 million in penalties and to satisfy other claims in the case. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the firm had reimbursed the government `` for the financial loss suffered as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>' wrongdoing Among other things, it paid more than $ 2 million in civil penalties, $ 1.5 million in criminal penalties, and had paid the department's administrative costs for the probe, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The company had also taken steps to protect the government from business dealings with the individuals responsible for the wrongdoing and had also instituted internal controls _ such as an ethics program _ `` to protect against a recurrence,'' said the statement. According to fiscal 1987 figures, the latest available, the parent <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's 46th largest defense contractor, receiving $ 359.4 million in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business. Federal prosecutors said their investigation focused on allegations that private consultants bribed government employees for information that gave client companies an edge in winning contracts. The indictments focused on activities alleged to have been undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement specialist <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> and private consultants <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>. Specifically, the indictment charged that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and three of its officers agreed to pay <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> $ 160,000 to assist them in obtaining a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract related to radar worth $ 100 million. To obtain the contract, the indictment contended <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, a California-based private consultant, who `` in turn paid <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> ... for his assistance in manipulating the procurement process to insure that the ... contract was awarded to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, said at the time of the suspension that the company's electronics division `` accounts for about 2 percent of our annual revenues, or in the $ 75 million range.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday requested to use $ 100 million from a court-monitored escrow account toward its rebuilding program, and union leaders said it was a sign the carrier is struggling in the 4-month-old strike. A spokesman for the Miami-based carrier contends it was well documented that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could use some profits from the sale of planes and other assets in its reorganization into a smaller company. Eastern filed papers in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seeking to free the $ 100 million to pay off expenses. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said he does not know when a ruling may be issued. `` It was known from the beginning that we could use some of the proceeds from our asset transactions for rebuilding,'' said <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` I do n't see why anyone is shocked by this.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for the funds suggests cash-flow problems in operating a smaller carrier `` Eastern's request is evidence that the company's reorganization plan is seriously flawed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is planning to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets, including a proposed $ 206.5 million sale of 16 planes, two Canadian routes and 13 gates at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In June, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sold its profitable Northeast shuttle service to billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. Eastern, which has tried to lure back passengers with reduced fares, has announced plans to double its present flight schedule by August, and build up to about 800 daily flights by the end of the year. Eastern flew 1,040 flights per day before Machinists, flight attendants and pilots walked off the job March 4. The airline sought bankruptcy-court protection March 9. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> also reported that creditors committee attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> said negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> are `` certainly going to be colored'' because of the request. <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Friday. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> released letters from two congressmen seeking further information on the Eastern bankruptcy proceedings. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolter </PERSON>, D-Pa., has requested more information on a study by bankruptcy court special examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, D-Calif., requested <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s evaluation of the union-backed bid for Eastern by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> options trader

 <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a large real estate company plagued by indebtedness stemming partly from its reliance on junk-bond financing, filed Friday for federal bankruptcy protection from creditors. The troubled company had been attempting to avoid bankruptcy by restructuring its property and financial holdings, but a $ 1 billion first - quarter loss placed it in technical default on the junk bonds Creditors had begun taking steps to force the company into bankruptcy. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is one of the largest ever by a company that used junk bonds as part of its financial strategy. Revco D.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a national drugstore chain that relied on junk bonds in a debt-financed takeover, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy a year ago after failing to make an interest payment on about $ 700 million in junk bonds. These bonds, commonly used by companies to bankroll expansion and acquisitions, are considered low-investment grade securities. They pay high rates of interest to compensate bondholders for the higher risk of buying them. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> has about 32,000 employees and 13,000 shareholders. Formerly known as Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>, the company buys, improves and sells real estate assets, manages apartments, nursing homes, shopping centers and office buildings, and owns <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacinto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION>, the ninth-largest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s previously disclosed forecasts show it can not continue to pay its interest and principal amortization obligations beyond Nov. 1, 1989,'' Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said in announcing the bankruptcy filing. `` It would be unfair to large portions of the company's constituencies to continue to pay the debt service in the interim, given all the circumstances. `` Accordingly, the board of directors has decided to discontinue its policy of paying all debt service as it comes due.'' Wall Street securities strategists that follow <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> had been predicting bankruptcy was a strong possibility and warned clients to avoid the company's stock. `` We see scant appeal to the individual investor in these shares,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, an analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wrote in a June report about <LOCATION> thecompany </LOCATION>'s deteriorating financial condition <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> will continue to operate while reorganizing, but could not predict when the company would emerge from bankruptcy. `` We chose reorganization through the court in light of our responsibilities to all of <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s key constitutiencies _ creditors, stockholders and bondholders, employees, customers and business partners, and vendors and suppliers.'' As part of the filing, <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION> received agreement from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that as long as the company can meet regulatory capital requirements at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Savings </LOCATION> and Loan, the government will not seek to shut down the $ 3.5 billion-asset thrift. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> has said before he hopes to base <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>'s resurgence on still-solvent <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION>. The filing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the company is incorporated, lists assets of $ 1.05 billion and liabilities of $ 1.4 billion, including $ 1.05 billion in unsecured debt sold through <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading issuer and marketer of junk bonds. Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company is protected from creditors while it devises a way to pay its debts and reorganize its business. <ORGANIZATION> Southmark </ORGANIZATION>, which began as a real estate investment trust operation of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, used the junk bonds to finance its rapid growth into a $ 8 billion-asset company with holdings from campgrounds to insurance companies and a range of real estate enterprises. However the company, which eventually moved to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has been strapped by liquidity problems, as it became victimized by the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s real estate collapse and was left holding huge numbers of non-performing assets. The liquidity problems eventually led to the ouster in January of Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, who were blamed for the situation. The board replaced with two with <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a thrift executive from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. In the months since, the company has sold off about $ 170 million in assets to improve its cash position. `` We have improved liquidity through asset sales,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said Friday, adding that the company had $ 85 million on hand to pay operating expenses. `` We will continue our program to sell selected assets,'' he said, leaving the company with a core of real estate and thrift operations. `` Without undue pressure from creditors, we can seek maximum value for these assets.'' The company said it would continue to seek buyers for its insurance, recreational land, health care and gaming interests.
