 Four-term socialist Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' party won another victory Tuesday, as former community development director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON> to become <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' successor <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> candidate, had 5,626 ballots, or 52 percent of the vote, to 4,400, or 41 percent, for Democrat <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>, a store owner who also had Republican backing, according to unofficial results. Sanders _ often billed as the nation's only socialist mayor _ had decided against another term. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> shies away from the socialist label, but ran under the banner of <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' party. `` Today was a referendum on Progressive government, and we won it,'' <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> told a throng of 150 supporters. He said he would continue to push most of <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' platform, which includes affordable housing and public access to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> waterfront. Also in the race were Greens party candidate <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> and `` tax revolt'' candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> received 596 votes, or 5 percent, and <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON> 91, or slightly less than 1 percent. Cold weather, which brought the wind chill factor to 43 degrees below zero Tuesday morning, may have kept some of the city's 25,000 registered voters away from the ballot box. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamarche </PERSON>, secretary to City Clerk <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>, said turnout was below average in the city of 38,000. The Progressives' success once again deprives the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the mayor's seat, which Democrats have not held since <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> beat longtime incumbent <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON> by 10 votes in 1981. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said the win was significant because it showed the Progressives' strength. `` It's not a one-man show, it's a movement,'' he said. `` That's what we've accomplished tonight. He said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters have been demoralized by the political process. `` People look to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, they do n't see anything. They look to the Republicans, and they do n't see anything. There is one city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that has said we can go beyond staus quo politics, we can talk real issues to the people, we can have a dream of a city and a state and county that is fundamentally different than it is now,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. The 47-year-old mayor, who is known for railing against the rich and powerful, decided in the fall to leave politics to teach and write. With a promise to fight for the underdog, the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, native was elected in 1981 by 10 votes over a Democrat. He was re-elected three times by more comfortable margins, winning in 1987 with 6,901 votes to 5,594 votes. Even <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' critics give him credit for reinvigorating city politics. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and World Report rated him in 1987 as one of the nation's 20 best mayors. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> has prospered and has been ranked highly in national quality-of-life surveys. Elsewhere around <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> it was Town Meeting Day, and residents braved the cold to travel to their town halls and approve school budgets and socialize with friends and neighbors not seen for a year. In nearly 70 towns, residents voted on a non-binding resolution asking the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the death penalty, last used in the 1950s. At least 45 towns supported capital punishment, but 18 rejected or tabled it. One town that voted down the resolution cited the recent film, `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which suggests that an innocent man faced the death penalty in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and two-thirds voted for reinstatement, said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheltra </PERSON>, a proponent of capital punishment and major force behind the town meeting resolution.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Monday dismissed charges against half of the 14 defendants in a massive, mob-linked drug conspiracy trial, finding prosecutors failed to prove their case because of `` ineptitude.'' `` If these drug dealers are walking free it's because you people are not competent,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprizzo </PERSON> told protesting prosecutors as he dismissed narcotics conspiracy charges against seven defendants in the Pizza Connection II drug trial. `` You let them go,'' <PERSON> Sprizzo </PERSON> told prosecutors later in the day. `` Do n't lay at my feet your ineptitude.'' The judge then barred lawyers from talking to reporters about the case. <PERSON> Sprizzo </PERSON> dropped the drug conspiracy charge after the government finished presenting its case and defense lawyers, contending the charge was too broad, made routine requests for the dismissal of charges for lack of evidence. The trial, which began last October, is a spinoff from the original, 17-month-long Pizza Connection drug trial, so named because prosecutors accused the defendants of using pizzerias in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> as fronts for their heroin dealing and money-laundering conspiracy. Eighteen of the 19 defendants in the first Pizza Connection trial were convicted. The 14 defendants in the Pizza Connection II case were accused of participating in a massive conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Some also were charged with possession of drugs with intent to distribute. The seven remaining defendants face maxiumum penalties of life in prison if convicted.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fasted for three days because he hungers for the defeat of Democratic mayoral nominee <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, but some Democrats say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s efforts are straining the two-time <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential contender's party credentials. `` What kind of credibility does that give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> nationwide with other Democrats?'' asks <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> party Chairman <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Demuzio </PERSON>. `` This is certainly not going to bode well for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> nationally if he has any future ambitions, which I'm sure he does.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary won last week by <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, but that was because his candidate of choice _ <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alderman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> _ sat out the primary in favor of a third-party bid in the April 4 general election. The attack on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s party credentials is only the latest event in what has become an imbroglio in the politics of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s black community since <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, died near the start of his second term in 1987 <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has tried to be a peacemaker, but his plea for unity among supporters of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> during the primary went unheeded. Now his position is at odds with the man <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> successfully backed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the first black to hold the top post, has announced his support of <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. To top it off, Republicans have taken note of the black split in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and some see it as playing into the hands of new <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who is trying to lure disenchanted blacks to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he is unfazed. `` In these contests, sometimes you win the votes and sometimes you do n't, but you must always preserve your dignity,'' he said Monday in a telephone interview while enroute from <LOCATION> Tuskegee </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` What that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> machine represents is a violation of people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of what he thinks would be a closed Democratic party under <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` It strips them of their dignity.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> denies that he represents the past or the politics of his father, the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who ran a vast patronage army. Young <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> talks, as do others, of unifying the city and giving all people opportunities. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> identifies the issue in his support of <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, running on the <ORGANIZATION> Harold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket, as `` reciprocity,'' meaning he wo n't support those who have n't supported him. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, D-Ill., a <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> ally who has criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s opposition to the Democratic mayoral nominee, received a letter from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that requested a meeting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said later Monday `` If you are serious about unity in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, I am perfectly willing to meet with you and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to discuss a similar deal,'' said the letter drafted by <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` If I do run -LRB- for president -RRB- in 1992 will you support my candidacy as a favorite son? That is the basis of a reciprocal deal.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the letter was `` kind of a rhetorical device.'' `` He's really not willing to talk to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is supporting <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed a slate of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> candidates last year, including <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> in his successful bid for a third term as county state's attorney. But he notes <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> did n't support him in his 1988 presidential bid and did n't endorse <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987. `` I reached out to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and endorsed him, and yet he seems to have no sense of obligation to be reciprocal or fair,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denies that race is the only issue, although <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is white and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is black. He says the issue is one of `` going forward'' instead of backwards. `` In <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION>, there is relief for those who have a history of monopolizing; grief for those who've been locked out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday at an Operation PUSH meeting where he also announced his three-day fast. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was taking only liquids, planned to return to a normal diet on Tuesday. A mostly white coalition of aldermen elected <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> over <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> a week after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died and many <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> supporters sat out last week's primary. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> got about half the votes <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did from the city's 19 predominately black wards. Some political analysts say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s run against the party's endorsed candidate in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> will have little bearing on his national standing `` It will certainly be used against him, but I think <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics is seen as.. a unique situation,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON> director of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Monday `` People who like what he stands for probably wo n't care if he endorses the -LRB- Democratic mayoral -RRB- nominee or not.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is `` succumbing to the delusion'' that the old ways will still work, opening the door for Democrats to regain the ideological initiative. `` It is time for Democrats to become once again the party of ideas,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat said in a lecture at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our opportunity now _ our responsibility _ is to ... to put forth a vision for the 1990s and beyond.'' The 1988 election, which he said was `` so apparently devoid of ideas,'' also revealed how important they are. The Republicans succeeded in defining the contest because `` there was no compelling Democratic message,'' he said. `` Competency was not enough,'' he said in a reference to the failed presidential campaign of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Ideology, which is about ideas, was missing, and our opponents filled the gap ...'' `` If you do n't define yourself, your opponent will. That is very dangerous in life and devasting in politics,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said at a news conference after his speech. `` The Republicans were able to define both Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a way I did n't recognize.'' The senator said the Democrats are now presented with a great opportunity because `` this <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president _ and perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ have run out of ideas.'' `` The administraion has no agenda other than coping, no real budget, no major initiatives and very little to say about what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls ` the vision thing,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` The administration holds office, but does n't know what to do with it,'' he said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` ca n't live permanently off the legacy of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> any more than Democrats can succeed by simply repeating <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` The other side is now succumbing to the delusion that did so much demage to Democrats in other days: They assume that old ways will continue to work, that they do n't have to rethink them, that they have won and will win if only they rerun the campaigns of the past.''

 A slumping economy is sending Norwegians on bargain hunts in junk shops and second-hand stores. When <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil wealth flowed, Norwegians spent freely in an economy that quickly became overheated, but the boom came to an abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged. `` Business is booming,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, who runs a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shop in the city of <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>. `` It's better than ever. So far this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year. `` People come here looking for everything from used clothes to furniture. They're being more careful with their money. `` We just may run out of used merchandise. People seem to be holding onto their things. They make do with an old couch for another year or use an old dress another season.'' <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>, the nation's oil capital on the west coast, was hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986, but the drop in national income has squeezed the whole country. With its offshore oil fields pumping 1.44 million barrels a day, lower crude prices quickly chilled <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s overheated economy. Tough measures, including legislated wage controls, have helped reduce inflation and the trade deficit. But unemployment doubled in the last year to 4 percent, the highest since the 1930s, and thousands of businesses went broke. The government decisions, combined with a modest recovery of oil prices, hold out promise for the future, but it may take time before it is felt in the household budget. `` Many Norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a little compared to 1986,'' said <PERSON> Oddbjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiden </PERSON>, an economist for the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry. He said consumer spending declined 1.6 percent in 1988 after dropping 2.7 percent in 1987. In 1986, the peak of the oil boom and spending spiral, consumption leaped 5.7 percent. `` It's hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise,'' said <PERSON> Oddbjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutsen </PERSON> of the state Institude of Social Research. He said it was possible that Norwegians were simply returning to a normal state of affairs. `` I do n't think the spending spree of mid-1980s was typical. Oil resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. And people spent money freely,'' he said. `` It's more typical of Norwegians to be careful with money. If they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much, then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and 1960s, when <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was not a rich nation.'' <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, who works for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s five-store Elevator thrift shops, said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic slump began. `` We have n't noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our stores individually. Sales are pretty stable. But a lot more used merchandise shops have opened in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> during the past year or two,'' he said. `` Business is up,'' said <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who has owned <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Willy </PERSON>'s Used Merchandise for 22 years `` But a lot of new stores have opened. There must be 10 that opened in the past two years.'' Twenty-nine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, a city of 425,000.

 Communist rebels have established a shadow government and are collecting taxes in this northern town named for the family of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> _ a fierce anti-Communist during his 20-year rule. Local military and civilian officials say this town of 12,000 people that is 230 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> became a rebel stronghold after the former president fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in the 1986 military-civilian uprising that propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. `` In the time of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, they were only in the mountains,'' Mayor <PERSON> Felicito </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> said of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now they have been able to reverse that. It's as if the timing was great _ Communists entering and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> leaving.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> town is about 10 miles south of <PERSON> Sarrat </PERSON>, where the former president was born 71 years ago. The town's 13 outlying hamlets, most named for members of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' family, have become gateways for guerrillas to slip down from the mountains into populous areas of <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province. `` They just pass through,'' said <PERSON> Melecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Duldulao </PERSON>, 45, chief of the hamlet of <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, named for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife. `` Occasionally, when they come at lunchtime, we ask them to join us. But that's all.'' <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> said the rebels have killed civilians, seized private property for their `` revolutionary agrarian reform'' and have forced businesses to pay protection money, or what they call `` revolutionary taxes.'' On March 1, army troops raided a 14-acre rebel training camp less than two miles from the town. The camp, which was abandoned, contained obstacle courses and a makeshift clinic. <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> said the rebel activity has created a climate of fear in the town which civilian and military officials appear powerless to stop. `` By 6 p.m., you should have already eaten and gone home,'' <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> said. `` Then make sure all the windows are closed.'' Townspeople say they try to remain neutral in the conflict but find themselves increasingly drawn into the cycle of violence. `` <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> arrived and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> arrived,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrigado </PERSON>, wife of a town official. `` We are really having a hard time. We are afraid. If we see the -LRB- rebels -RRB-, we get scared. When we see the military we also get scared.'' <PERSON> Duldulao </PERSON> said the rebels began infilrating his hamlet, about a mile east of the town center, in 1984. Four years later, they killed <PERSON> Artemio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manguma </PERSON>, leader of the village security volunteers and a suspected military informant, he said. Several months later, rebels tied up <PERSON> Duldulao </PERSON> in front of his eight children but released him after his wife, <PERSON> Milagros </PERSON>, convinced them he had no links to the military. `` They have organized in the -LRB- village -RRB- level,'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Bayani </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabic </PERSON>, northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> commander. `` They have organized economic committees and are already collecting taxes.'' The army's 45th Infantry Battalion operates in the area, and <LOCATION> Fabic </LOCATION> has stepped up intelligence-gathering operations against the shadow governments, which he considers the principal threat. `` To us, the armed component is easy to control,'' <PERSON> Fabic </PERSON> said, referring to armed guerrillas. `` But to uproot the political structure of the shadow government, that is a very tedious process.'' Rev. <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonoan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese, said the church plays a leading role in mediating between the military and the rebels. He said priests often must defend parishioners accused by the military of sympathizing with the rebels, whose insurgency is 20 years old. `` Most of them are victims in this war,'' <PERSON> Bonoan </PERSON> said. `` People are branded Communist rebels even before they become one.'' Last May, gunmen who <PERSON> Bonoan </PERSON> said were believed to be soldiers massacred a family of five in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Vintar </LOCATION>. No one was arrested, he said. `` That has added to the people's dissatisfaction and demoralization with the government,'' <PERSON> Bonoan </PERSON> said. `` They have lost confidence in the government.''

 Chinese primary school pupils are far better at mathematics than <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youngsters and are more organized and attentive in their studies, a study by experts from the two countries indicates. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> surveyed pupils in 20 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> schools and 11 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> schools, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Professor <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ge </PERSON> of the Chinese academy's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychology </ORGANIZATION> said in a report on the study that said one reason the Chinese outshined the Americans was that American textbooks teach less about fractions, ratios, proportion and decimals than Chinese textbooks. She also said Chinese teachers spend more time on math, and that general math concepts are taught earlier in Chinese than American schools. Ms. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children spend half their class time without leadership `` and are more likely to be engaged in inappropriate activities than Chinese students.'' American students spent less than half the time on assigned tasks as Chinese children, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children pay less attention to their teachers, the paper quoted her as saying. Ms. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> added that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> children may be under greater social pressure to succeed because passing national examinations to get into good schools is directly related to their future jobs. The report did not provide figures on how the two groups scored in the math tests.

 Wintertime, and the living is easy in the kingdom of Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rat which has become uncommonly numerous around <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Complaints about rats are up as much as 70 percent in parts of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which has had just a touch of slush during a very mild winter. Similar increases have been reported in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and other large cities. `` I've never, never known such a year,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, chief environmental services officer of <ORGANIZATION> Babergh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> northeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I have n't had a Saturday off since the end of November.'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, health officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said he received 1,323 rat complaints last winter. This year, he had matched that total by late December _ before winter had officially begun. <ORGANIZATION> Rentokil </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest exterminators, has doubled its sales of poisons this winter, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, the company's director of public relations With the increase in rats, there has been a growing concern about <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>'s disease, which is spread by rat urine in water. The ailment used to be seen mostly in miners and sewer workers, but cases have cropped up among water skiers and canoeists. The reasons for the rat's prosperity are various. `` We've had mild winters before, without having more rats,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, retired senior lecturer in Zoology at <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holloway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> and author of scholarly books on vermin. `` Certainly in towns, one aspect of it is the lack of good hygiene,'' said <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, who has done research on rats in coal mines and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> canefields. `` It's one of those things, a general lack of attention. This country is pretty scruffy,'' he said. <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the Institution of Environmental Officers, said decaying Victorian sewage systems in big cities have contributed to the problem. She also blamed the illegal dumping of garbage, and the spread of fast-food restaurants. Efforts to poison rats have been frustrated by the rich menu of trash and debris, especially from fast-food restaurants, said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, environmental health officer for the borough of Lambeth in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` They would rather eat that than our poison,'' she said. The sewers, at least, have their defenders. `` There have been a lot of stories around recently, a story which comes up year after year after year, that rat populations are increasing and sewers are decaying. I just say: prove it,'' said <PERSON> Brigette </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Thames Water, which is responsible for a thousand miles of sewers in and around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. If there are more rats about, she said, `` we believe they are above-ground rats.'' In <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, an industrial city in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the sewers are taking the blame without dispute. `` The sewers are crumbling because of lack of upkeep, and the rats are finding it increasingly easy to get out,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>'s assistant chief environmental health officer. `` Also, there is a great deal of redevelopment going on, and if the drains are not properly sealed when the old buildings are knocked down the rats can find their way up them and appear, to everyone's horror, on the nice piece of landscaped garden outside the gleaming new office blocks.'' <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> said his rat-control budget has not been increased in three years, and nine of 54 positions in his department are vacant. `` We can control rats in two ways _ by blocking up the holes in the sewers so that they can not get out, and by poisoning them. We want to do both, but the government's spending limits mean that we can not do either properly,'' he said. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> dismissed stories in the tabloid press which have claimed that a `` super rat'' has emerged from the sewers. He recalled coal miners telling him about big rats, rats big enough to enter in a dog show, and the sage insight of one miner: `` No one ever sees a small rat.''

 The furor over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' highlights a gulf between <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its Moslem minorities. Here is a report from an English city with a large Moslem community.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s Moslems invited <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickles </PERSON>, leader of the city council, to a public burning of `` The Satanic Verses'' and were surprised when he refused. The incident illustrates the gap <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel opened between <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and its minority Moslems _ between men like <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> <PERSON> Azam </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s 60,000 Moslems, and Pickles, the Anglo-Saxon businessman to whom he extended the invitation. <PERSON> Azam </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> 48 years ago, was equally offended by British outrage at the book-burning. `` We were left with even more hurt and frustration,'' he said. `` The publicity we got was that Moslems are doing something not in line with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> culture and tradition.'' Pickles, 36, said: `` They were genuinely surprised I would n't go. That burning book brought back all kinds of images of repression, in particular <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the'30s. ... It's an obscene act.'' The protest Jan. 14 in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of 500,000 people was widely publicized in Moslem countries. Some analysts believe it began the international crisis in which Iranian spiritual leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> killed, driving the author him into hiding. Outraged Moslems say `` The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portraying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it directly from Allah. Like most Bradford Moslems of his generation, <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in the 1950s to work in a textile mill. He now heads a chain of Moslem-run supermarkets and is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosques </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> organization. From book burning in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> to pro-Khomeini demonstrations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the uproar over `` The Satanic Verses'' has increased the alienation of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 5 million Moslems. Officials in <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, ordered increased security around a monument to <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Alighieri </PERSON> on Sunday after a group threatened to blow it up because the medieval poet's famed `` Divine Comedy'' places the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in hell. The main Moslem communities are <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> immigrants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who have made no significant protest about <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; and Pakistanis and Indians in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Firebombs have been thrown at two mosques in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and there are fears of a religious and racial backlash against Moslems. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosques </ORGANIZATION> is on the edge of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> quarter and has been under discreet police guard since intruders broke in last month and left a message: `` Leave Rushdie Alone.'' Most government and intellectual comment has focused on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s right of free speech, but the affair has racial undertones and has revived calls for stricter curbs on Third World immigration `` It is becoming disturbingly clear that immigrants, anyhow from Islamic countries, are going to constitute the biggest concentration of religious fanaticism ... this country has experienced for many centuries,'' <PERSON> Peregrine </PERSON> <PERSON> Worsthorne </PERSON>, editor of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in a signed editorial. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, president of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said the controversy reflects `` exactly what I am afraid of for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, namely the invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by Moslem immigrants.'' Conservatives like <PERSON> Worsthorne </PERSON> say British liberals are reaping the harvest of their multicultural doctrines, which hold that ethnic minorities should be free to preserve their cultures rather than blending into the society. Commentator <PERSON> Auberon </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON> pointed to the irony of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> enjoying the protection of a government he has likened to a police state and the police he has denounced as racist. `` He should pay for any police protection he may judge advisable,'' <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON> wrote in the conservative weekly Spectator. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, of Moslem parents but now is a British citizen. `` The Satanic Verses'' was published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last fall. Liberal intellectuals, among whom <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is prominent, have united with <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the Conservative prime minister who ordinarily is their favorite hate figure, in defense of free speech. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also joined it, but notes that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s record includes banning broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and spending millions on law suits to suppress `` Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of a retired intelligence agent. `` They -LRB- the government -RRB- are total hypocrites,'' Labor foreign affairs spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They've spent the last several years suppressing freedom of speech in every way they can. Labor also has been accused by some of its own supporters of pulling its punches for fear of losing Moslem votes. Many British Moslems consider speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers about democratic values and civilized behavior insensitive at best and at worst intolerant. `` Those who wish to make their home in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, to contribute to our society and to prosper within it, can not deny to others the very freedoms which drew them to this country,'' Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at a political meeting in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Liaqat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Azam </PERSON>'s deputies, responded: `` They are turning the attention of the British public against the Moslem people.'' Former Mayor <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajeeb </PERSON>, the first non-white to run a British city, said: `` A form of racism manifests itself in times of tension and that's what is happening now,'' In one view, the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair is a power struggle between fundamentalists and secularized Moslems. Some Islamic religious leaders have supported <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death call and none has publicly rejected it. Moderate Moslems are embarrassed and fear association with a fundamentalist image that equates in many West European minds with hostage-taking, airline bombings and keeping women in veils. Pickles said of the situation in <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>: `` We've done all right so far over this ... but if something happens to Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, then we could be in trouble.''

<HEAD>Polish Border Authorities Block More Than 3,000 Food Smugglers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 3,000 Poles have recently been caught trying to smuggle food into <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to sell at a profit, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. In one case, a Pole tried to smuggle a goat and a baby pig into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON>, spokesman for the main customs office, was quoted as saying. `` We will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes completely,'' <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the report Monday. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> did not say during what period of time the offenders were caught by customs officials. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> did not say during what period of time the offenders were turned back. Communist authorities on Jan. 1 eased procedures to obtain passports and thousands of Poles have headed West to trade, mainly to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> where visas are not required. <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON> said Poles were allowed to take enough food for their journey, but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive amount. He said some Polish passengers on a train en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> threw food away when they saw customs officers approach. Trading in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is tempting to Poles because they can buy goods in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for zlotys, sell them for hard currency in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and then convert that money back into zlotys at the black-market rate for a profit.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> will be replaced as part of a `` major turnover'' in the administration intended to reflect President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s priorities and views, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite a concerted effort by <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> to hold onto his job, the search for his replacement is under way, the newspaper said in Tuesday editions. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> presided over the government's massive program to give legal status to illegal aliens. The report came in the wake of a recent <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audit that was highly critical of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> management practices, citing such problems as missing documents, massive backlogs of cases and failure to conduct background checks on many applicants for citizenship. In addition, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has been criticized for the agency's plan to dig a four-mile-long ditch on the <LOCATION> Mexico-California </LOCATION> border near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to deter smuggling. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, whose department oversees the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, wants to bring `` new blood'' to the agency, the Times said. The president indicated `` he would like to see major turnover of people in the Administration to reflect his views and priorities,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` The attorney general has been engaged in the process of interviewing people for major positions,'' said spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` No determination has been made with regard to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>.'' No decision on a replacement is expected this month, the Times said. Administration sources said several people have been mentioned as possible successors to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, but no front-runner has emerged. `` We're not in a position to confirm or deny that. To the best of my knowledge, he has not been told that. I just talked to him,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON>. The report that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was being ushered out was no surprise to several immigrant rights activists. `` There are enough people out there who want him out to start a club,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney who took over the job in 1982, oversaw implementation of the landmark 1986 immigration reform law and was sharply criticized by alien advocates who said he was slow in informing the public about the measure's provisions.

<HEAD>Milan Presents A Cozy, Sporty Look</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1989-1990 winter look _ Italian style _ is a cozy combination of soft fabrics and casual styles. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s top ready-to-wear designers, including <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> <PERSON> Missoni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>, are showing their winter wears during the five days of shows here. As the second day unfolded Monday, it became apparent that <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> designers are not going to sacrifice wearability for creativity. Gone are the padded shoulders, frilly blouses, and short hip-hugging skirts, to be replaced by dropped sleeves, sporty sweaters, and lots and lots of pants. There are skirts as well, but except for <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, who shocked the fashion crowd with a miniskirt so short it barely covered the derriere, designers opted for a classic knee length, or a comfortable mid-calf hemline. <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> will always favor black, but the winter wear was also full of bright colors and prints for both day and night. Its a big season for message prints as well, with such slogans as `` very expensive'' appearing on a Moschino jacket, and the word `` fog'' written on the back of a gray cashmere dress by <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>. Then there are the usual floral prints, this time inspired by rich velvet, geometric figures and letters, and the animal prints championed by <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION>. This year she dedicates her collection to the ferocious tiger, putting his stripes as well as his face and tail on sweaters and dresses alike. Speaking of animals, there is a runway battle going on between the conservationist designers, who are showing only fake furs this season, and those who can not abandon the luxurious feel of the real thing. Thus <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> at his <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> collection opened with a group of stuffed animals ranging from teddy bears to sables to introduce his new line of synthetic fun furs. The look-alikes were fashioned into elegant stoles and capes, full length coats, and sporty jackets. At the other end of the spectrum are the <ORGANIZATION> Fendis </ORGANIZATION>, who show their new fur collection today, but who are showing off their original ultra-light workmanship of humble skunks and squirrels as well as lofty sable and mink, throughout the week at their downtown Milan showrooms. In the accessory department, the big item is the long strand of beads in shiny stones or gold, somewhere between a designer jewelry rip-off and 1920's flapper beads. These beads can be worn casually by day, or decorate an otherwise simple black evening gown. <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> even had strands twined around the collar of a lavish fur coat. Shoes this season are generally flat to go with the comfortable look of the clothes, with a rare spiked heel for more sophisticated evening wear. After a number of seasons of cropped boyish haircuts, designers are proposing women with manes of wild curly hair. If all hair growing lotions fail to produce the required length by October, chief Italian fashion pranster <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> offers a solution _ a curly blond wig, the same one the balding black mustachioed designer wears in his present ad campaign.

<HEAD>Drug Related Parole Violations to be Reported Sooner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is tightening its drug regulations on federal parolees who used to get up to three chances to slip up and use drugs before the commission heard about it. The previous policy `` stated that when any three violations occurred in a 12-month period, the probation officer did n't have to notify us until after the three violations occurred,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marble </PERSON>, the commission's director of case operations and program development. `` Now we require it immediately,'' she said Monday. `` As soon as the first drug violation occurs, they have to notify us.'' The new procedures are effective immediately. Affected by the new rules are about 12,900 people on parole and 2,500 who were required to serve their full sentences less good time off, she said. The latter are under <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> supervision until the end of their original sentences. They are supervised by about 2,220 probation officers. `` The reason that it's so important to find out immediately if these people are using drugs is because they commit criminal behavior to support their drug addiction,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marble </PERSON> said. `` It's a very expensive habit and they have to get the money for it somewhere,'' she said. `` Most of them do n't have jobs or good enough jobs to pay for the drugs, and it's important to get those people off the streets to protect the public.'' Parolees who have had a history of drug abuse `` are required to submit to urinalysis, to participate in drug counseling sessions and, on occasion, to be placed in an inpatient drug treatment program,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marble </PERSON> said. Not all parolees found to have used drugs, missed a counseling appointment or failed or refused to submit a urine sample would be sent back to prison, she said. The commission has a range of options from returning the parolee to prison immediately after a hearing to sending him to a community-based drug-treatment center, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Marble </PERSON> estimated that 50 percent of federal prisoners are confined for drug charges _ drug dealing to money-laundering _ but these rules are aimed at those among them who use drugs. The new procedures were approved by the commission 7-0 at a Feb. 8 meeting but not announced until Monday.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Intervene in Corporal Punishment Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conflicts are sure to continue among the nation's courts over the use of corporal punishment in public schools due to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s reluctance to address the issue. The court on Monday refused, without comment, to review a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that permitted two kindergarten girls to be paddled severely for snickering. Lawyers for the girls cited <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> studies indicating that 30,000 American schoolchildren are physically injured each year `` because of the infliction of corporal punishment to a degree that requires medical treatment.'' Their appeal said those studies estimate `` at least 100,000 children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive and inappropriate school punishment each year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> also urged the justices to hear arguments in the case. But the court left unresolved whether the Constitution affords any protection against corporal punishment by teachers and school administrators. Left intact is a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that allows the use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, but other federal appeals courts have made it easier for schoolchildren to sue in such cases. For example, the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case that `` at some degree of excessiveness or cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutional rights. The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary measures involving physical force do not amount to `` cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment. While the decision barred students from suing teachers and school administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment violations, it left them free to sue in state courts under state laws. The 1977 decision left it unclear whether corporal punishment ever may violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment that protects due process rights. The case the court turned aside Monday came from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where on May 6, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cunningham </ORGANIZATION>, 5, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 6, were paddled twice _ once by their school principal and once by their teacher. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, the principal at <ORGANIZATION> Westside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kindergarten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, saw the two girls snickering in the hall and gave each child two swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle. When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> saw them still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gave each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle. Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in their behalf said the reason for their absence was `` severe pain'' and fear of returning to school. According to court documents, both girls were taken to a child welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse. The children's federal lawsuit _ dismissed by a judge _ sought monetary damages in alleging the girls were victims of conduct that was `` excessive, brutal, disproportionate to the circumstances -LRB- and -RRB- shocking to the conscience.'' In other action Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Ruled that people accused of drunken driving usually have no right to a jury trial if they face a jail term of no more than six months The court said unanimously in a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> case that states do not violate fair-trial rights by treating drunken driving as a petty offense not warranting trial by jury. _ Rejected an appeal by Northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by factories and power plants in other states _ Agreed to review the fines imposed against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan _ Agreed to decide in a case from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state whether a prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other constitutional safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs

<HEAD>Crisis in Relations Drags on; Election Seen as Rigged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the prospect of a rigged election perpetuating the rule of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, administration officials and other experts see little hope of any thaw in U.S.-Panamanian relations. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ruling coalition has selected a <LOCATION> Noriega </LOCATION> confidant, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, as the official candidate in the May 7 election, an indication that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> intends to continue running the government from behind the scenes, much as he has for the past five years. This is causing headaches for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy makers, who see <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as one of the major hemispheric issues facing the new administration, ranking alongside debt, drug trafficking and Marxist penetration of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as priority problems. A prime concern is the continued smooth functioning of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Almost nothing has gone right for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since relations began to deteriorate in June 1987. A year ago, administration officials confidently predicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would quickly fall after a series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions were imposed. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander who is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug smuggling charges, has survived the challenge, leaving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials perplexed and divided on what to do next. Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, the Panama-based commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, has taken the unusual step of going public with his concerns, suggesting that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the beneficiary of a policy vacuum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There is virtually unanimous agreement among government and outside analysts that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is laying the groundwork for a fraudulent election. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` has been moving adroitly to manipulate'' the balloting against an opposition slate. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last month that `` it is hard to imagine a free and fair election'' being carried out in an atmosphere of `` heavy-handed repression and intimidation.'' A report released last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Puebla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a lay <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> human rights group, said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> denies basic civil liberties and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allies control the electoral tribunal and voter lists and also are in charge of the balloting. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, who wrote a portion of the report, said there is a widespread expectation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that `` these elections will be the most fraudulent of all in a series of fraudulent elections'' in that country. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-funded </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said a huge majority of Panamanians oppose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and they may be able use the election process to their advantage. <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON>, who returned recently from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be weakened politically from the process if it exposes the depth of the sentiment against him. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may be faced with a choice of calling off the election or engaging in massive fraud to ensure victory, leaving him in a difficult position both at home and internationally, <PERSON> Gershman </PERSON> said. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a captain of the anti-Noriega forces in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, agreed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may have to confront that unhappy choice. `` Nobody believes the election will be a solution in the struggle,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> was appointed by ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as ambassador, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize both. In February 1988, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but instead was deposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies hours later. Latin American democracies have kept a diplomatic distance from the Noriega-led government, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has shunned virtually all dealings with it. This has created a variety of problems for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including obtaining such mundane items as license plates and driver's licenses. To minimize hardship, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sharply reduced its staff in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and additional cuts are under consideration.

 Army Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> feels remorse for spying in behalf of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations and hopes for clemency from the military judge before whom he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of espionage, his lawyer says. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s civilian counsel, said Monday that the 30-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native is `` truly sorry for whatever damage he may have done to national security'' and will `` throw himself on the mercy of his military judge.'' Under a plea agreement, Hall can not receive the death penalty. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> admitted during his court-martial Monday that he participated between 1983 and 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver classified military information to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, the military judge presiding at the court-martial at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will decide whether to accept <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s plea after hearing the prosecution's case and defense witnesses. Court officials said the final verdict and sentence probably would come Friday at the soonest. Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and accused of delivering film and documents dealing with communications intelligence and war plans to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was assigned to the 24th Infantry Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s G-2 intelligence section. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and spent most of his career in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> working as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages. Hall pleaded guilty under an agreement that prohibits the government from seeking the death penalty. The maximum punishment he could receive is life in prison, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, dishonorable discharge and a fine. A still-secret part of the plea agreement outlines the sentence that Hall will receive unless the presiding judge, who is not permitted to see the sentencing agreement, imposes a lighter sentence. If the judge imposes a sentence that is harsher than the one in the agreement, the agreement will prevail. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> waived his right to a grand jury-type hearing to determine if a court-martial was warranted and agreed to be tried by a single military judge rather than a panel of officers. He also agreed to submit to `` unlimited debriefing'' and polygraph examination by government officials and to testify, if called, at grand jury proceedings against <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, a Turkish-born, naturalized citizen to whom <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> allegedly passed the classified information. The plea agreement requires that Hall sign away any profits he might earn in the future from any publication based on his involvement in the espionage case. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said through a military spokesman that he would not comment on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s motivation for passing classified information until after <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> has been questioned by <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> during the closed part of the court-martial.

 The first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrat to support Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has frequently sided with Republicans but also cast crucial votes against three of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominees. Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s most consistent Democratic supporter in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but he played a major role in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejection of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. He also cast the deciding vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of two other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominees, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> for the number three post in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> B. Sessions for a federal judgeship in south <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> on Monday announced that he would break ranks with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues and support Tower's confirmation. `` I will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove himself,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said in a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, referring to Tower's promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the Pentagon. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> met privately with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for 45 minutes last week to discuss the Tower nomination. He said afterward that he believes a president's appointments should be confirmed unless it can be proven `` that the person is flawed or that he would be a detriment to the country.'' In Tower's case, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he was not convinced after reading the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports that the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator has a drinking problem that would disqualify him from serving in the nation's top military post. `` In reviewing all of the charges, I have concluded that his conduct in many areas is not applaudable and not without justifiable criticism, but on the other hand, not disqualifying,'' he said. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> also cited Tower's qualifications for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post and said that in the six years that he served with Tower in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, between 1978 and 1984, he never saw nor heard any evidence that Tower had a drinking problem. Had Tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> might well have voted against confirmation. But he said the since the secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be responsible and accountable for Tower's conduct. `` It is the president's cabinet,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said, `` not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' cabinet. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, a 67-year-old ex-Marine and former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> chief justice, was widely criticized in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> for his opposition to both <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and Sessions, but neither vote appears to have caused him any lasting political damage. First elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 with more than 90 percent of the general election vote, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> was re-elected in 1984 with 63 percent of the vote against a conservative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent.

<HEAD>Massive Flare from Sun Disrupts Communications, May Affect Satellites</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: May be topped.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the most intense solar flares since 1984 could still be making itself felt Wednesday by triggering the aurora borealis and giving faulty commands to satellites. The massive flare erupted Monday on the eastern edge of the sun, sending a burst of radiation that interfered with a navigation system and some communications, federal officials said. Officials expected havoc early today as a result of a burst of high-energy particles from the flare, which they said could affect some aircraft communication and television signals. Forecaster <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunches </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said the flare was beyond the measuring capacity of the agency's GOES satellites. He estimated the solar eruption was the most powerful since April 1984. The flare, detected at 9:05 a.m. EST, affected the Loran navigation system of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and disrupted some short-wave radio communications. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> center, said another effect, called a geomagnetic storm, may arrive at Earth about 9 a.m. EST Wednesday. A geomagnetic storm is a wave of magnetically charged particles smashing into the Earth's magnetic field, disrupting natural currents and triggering the aurora borealis, or northern lights. The storm also slightly heats the atmosphere, causing it to expand. This, in turn, can affect the flight paths of satellites in relatively low orbits. The geomagnetic storm, said <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON>, also could energize particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. If these particles hit a satellite, he said, it could cause the craft to receive stray signals or faulty commands. <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said the flare occurred on the eastern edge of the sun, which means that much of the radiation will not affect the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> directly. The same area of the sun that spawned the flare, however, is rotating closer into view. `` Over the next two weeks we could more more vulnerable to more flares,'' he said. The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in intensity later this year or early in 1990. A flare occurs when energy stored by the sun's magnetic fields suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to heat and radiation within a few minutes, <PERSON> Heckman </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> solar telescopes recorded a flare of particles rising some 70,000 miles from the surface of the sun.

 A lawmaker wants the state to change its name to `` Dakota'' to project a simpler, warmer image, but one newspaper suggests officials should take a hint from their neighbor to the north. Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON> is sponsoring a resolution to drop `` North'' from the state's name, a change voters would have to approve. Supporters say `` North'' connotes a cold, harsh climate. <PERSON> Mathern </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that the adjective detracts from the word `` <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' which means `` friend'' or `` ally'' in the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> language. `` Dakota speaks to what we are most proud about, the wholesomeness and hospitality of our people,'' he said. Business also would appear to support the change, said state Tourism Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuglie </PERSON>. Telephone books in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s four largest cities list only 27 businesses with `` <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'' in their name while 233 use `` <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' he said.

The winner of The Billings Gazette contest was `` Manitscolda,'' pronounced `` Man-it's - cold-uh,'' an apparent takeoff on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor The committee took no action on the resolutions.

 Officials trying to reclaim city streets from flocks of messy birds have found an unlikely ally: brightly colored beach ball-sized balloons with huge, buggy eyes. `` Supposedly, they look like predators and the birds go somewhere else,'' Mayor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

But since setting up about two dozen of the menacing ballooons, the birds have moved along and city workers have reclaimed park benches in front of city hall. `` We're crossing our fingers,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strine </PERSON>, the city's director of public works `` The short-term results appear good.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest peace movement has come under a new barrage of criticism from hawks and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is heading the attacks by questioning group members' loyalty to their country. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s remarks Sunday that Peace Now activists are in cahoots with `` the most dangerous and extremist of our enemies'' triggered a barrage of accusations and counterattacks. Peace Now members, like all other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens, serve in the armed forces and do annual reserve duty. `` They are sabotaging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s political war, the war for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security ... They are helping the most dangerous and most extremist of our enemies,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tzahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, agreed. `` At the height of the uprising when there are blood riots and Jews are being murdered, they -LRB- Peace Now members -RRB- go crawling toward the leaders of the uprising and break a rule that every self-respecting Jew abides, which is to wait for the government's decisions,'' <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON> said He was referring to the actions Saturday of thousands of Peace Now members, who tried to drive into the occupied territories to talk peace with Palestinians. The army, which bars political activity in the occupied areas, sealed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and turned back activists headed to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villages. Underlying the attacks on Peace Now, however, is the group's controversial decision several months ago to change its stand toward the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ which right-wing circles still consider a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and call on the government to talk peace with Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> The government refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Peace Now also favors territorial compromise. The loosely organized Peace Now does not keep membership rosters, and therefore has no clear estimate of its popularity. But scores of thousands of people turned up at a recent rally calling for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> urged leftist legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> to cancel a scheduled trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later this week for a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> conference with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` This is an attempt to try and influence the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> -RRB- government, not through a debate in Parliament or through elections ... but through the foreign media and foreign governments,'' he said. `` This, to my mind, is something that should not be done.'' <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harel </PERSON>, a leader of the Gush Emunim Jewish settlement movement in the occupied territories, has accused Peace Now of running to talk with Palestinians while resisting talks with right-wing Israelis. `` The agenda should be that first we come to a national consensus, and then present that to the Arabs,'' <PERSON> Harel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, called Peace Now `` the most marginal of marginal elements,'' and added: `` They are n't worth the paper used to write on about them.'' Twenty legislators of left-wing parties and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signed a letter to the prime minister, demanding he retract the statements, made at a meeting of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. Peace Now activist and playwright <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabash </PERSON> had harsh words for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, and accused him of `` starting a drive of incitement and bloodletting.'' He was referring to the 1983 murder of peace activist <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenzweig </PERSON>, killed by a fellow Israeli who hurled a hand-grenade into an anti-war and Peace Now rally. Peace Now does not plan to give up its struggle. The movement was formed in 1978 as a pressure group to persuade then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> to make concessions for peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. A peace treaty was signed the following year, with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> returning the entire <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> desert captured in 1967. Movement leaders feel the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising has created an historic opportunity for another peace settlement in the region. `` It's our job to prepare people's hearts for compromise,'' <PERSON> Barabash </PERSON> said. Some 399 Arabs and 17 Israelis have been killed in the Palestinian revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.

Crystal Color Plastic Wrap generated lots of enthusiasm in focus groups and simulated test markets, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waring </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' consumer products division. `` Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting,'' she said, noting that the same thing has been done to paper clips and rubber bands.

Ms. <PERSON> Waring </PERSON> declined to speculate on the impact the colored wrap might have on sales or how much the new product, which has been in the works three to fours years, cost to develop. The consumer products division accounts for 10 percent of <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' sales, she said. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> reported a record net income of $ 482 million, or $ 8.35 per share, on revenues of $ 5.6 billion.

<HEAD>Share Prices Recover, Dollar up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, and the dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 9.63-point loser Monday, rose 61.08 points, or 0.19 percent, and closed at 31,937.94. The index plunged in early trading but turned around by midmorning. The dollar closed at 129.03 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's 127.63-yen finish It opened at 129.25 yen and ranged between 128.87 yen and 129.28 yen. `` The arrest of -LRB- Hisashi -RRB- Shinto certainly caused the early morning decline in the index, but a majority of investors seemed to have recovered from their -LRB- initial -RRB- discouragement,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Prosecutors on Monday arrested Shinto, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company, on charges of bribery in connection with a major stock scandal involving top politicians. His arrest was expected to spark concern over the fate of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s administration. Another factor affecting the Nikkei index, a key barometer for the market, was Tuesday's account settlement in the futures market, the analyst said. Participants were inclined to sell off issues and buy cheaper future issues, he said, speaking anonymously. In currency dealings, trading was described as light as market players stepped to the sidelines following news of the arrests of Shinto and his former secretary, said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Because the dollar had risen quite high against the yen already, participants were reluctant to continue their dollar buying, but `` there are no incentives not to buy the dollar either,'' the dealer said. Meanwhile, Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that the yen's decline `` did not have anything to do -LRB- with Shinto's arrest -RRB-. It's a market, afterall, and who knows why it moves.''

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increases in housing prices and mortgage interest rates caused a January drop in an index measuring the ability of a typical American family to buy a home, a real estate trade group says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> says its affordability index was at 108 in January, down from 111.2 in December. It was the largest month-to-month drop since a similar decline in January 1988. The new January number means that a family earning the median income of $ 32,207 annually had 8 percent more income than needed to qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a median-priced home. The median price for an existing home in January was $ 91,500, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. January's median was up $ 2,800 from the previous month The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 9.61 percent in January from 9.59 percent, representing a composite of fixed and adjustable rates.

 Some commercial and homemade chopped garlic and oil mixes can cause potentially fatal botulism if left at room temperature, the federal government warns. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also asked producers of the commercial products to review their labeling to assure that the need for refrigeration is clearly marked on shipping cartons and the product containers. The warnings follow an investigation in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, last month in which two men and a woman were hospitalized with botulism after a dinner at the home of one of the victims. The three had eaten a chopped garlic and oil mix that had been used in a spread for garlic bread, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said garlic and oil mixes containing little or no acidifying agent such as phosphoric or citric acid should be kept refrigerated at all times _ from manufacture to consumption. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> studies have shown that garlic in an oil mixture can support growth of clostridium botulinum bacteria, whose spores produce a deadly toxin under certain conditions. Botulism is characterized by blurred or double vision, speech and breathing difficulty and progressive paralysis. Without prompt and correct treatment, a third of those diagnosed with it may die, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Preliminary findings in the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> incident being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> implicated a commercially prepared mix called Colavita Chopped Garlic in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Colavita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON>, who would have gotten the pay hike had it cleared <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` the ultimate in unconscionable self-appreciation for TV and cable personalities ... many of whom make 10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman, to indulge in a Messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep pace with inflation for congressmen, key government officials and judges.'' `` Are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest for ratings, money and power really performing more valuable service than those that grant and manage communications licenses, pass laws and govern the nation?

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Soviet rock music fans thronged record stores in a snowstorm to buy a new album by some of the West's biggest stars and carry home autographs of the likes of British rocker <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> The album, with music by two dozen Western musicians, was produced by <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, the international environmental group. Millions of dollars from its sales will go toward fighting environmental problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The hoopla was especially great Monday on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospekt </PERSON> outside the Melodiya store, where <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION> autographed copies of `` Breakthrough.'' The album also contains music by artists including U2, Sting, the Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the News, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> and the Range, Sade, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cougar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellencamp </PERSON> and Dire Straits. At the <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> store, a police guard was posted at the door, and a steel barricade was set up on the sidewalk as young Soviets wearing traditional Russian fur hats and Western-style ski caps massed. Melodiya, the name of the state's record company as well as record stores, is known for small pressings of popular albums, especially rock, and the initial pressing of 500,000 copies of `` Breakthrough'' was likely to last just a couple of days _ if not hours. Melodiya plans to release 3 million copies, as well as 500,000 cassettes, in this country of 285 million people. A black market for Western rock recordings thrives in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and even <ORGANIZATION> Melodiya </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukharado </PERSON> admitted to reporters, `` I do n't know how many -LRB- copies -RRB- will be released on the black market.'' The two-record album carries a compilation of songs previously issued in the West by the individuals and groups. International release is scheduled for April 25. <PERSON> Sukharado </PERSON> said <PERSON> Melodiya </PERSON> will donate about $ 16 million from record sales to a Moscow-based charity that is working with <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> on environmental problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahouth </PERSON>, the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> branch in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said his organization plans to open an office in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some of the rock stars told a news conference here that they were surprised at how well rock is known in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where the music was once condemned as `` decadent'' and kept underground. Now, the sounds of Dire Straits or Soviet pop stars like <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> are heard on once-staid official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, keyboard player for the Talking Heads, said he and several other Western musicians visited a rock music center Sunday night in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and saw Soviet musicians who had made their own instruments. `` That shows how much the kids in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> want to play rock music and are interested in it,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said he liked several Soviet rock groups and quipped, `` This is the best way to conquer the West.'' He said he learned during his visit that one of his albums had been released in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and `` found the fans here very warm, friendly and generous.'' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> said he would like to perform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next year if his band is ready.

<HEAD>Woman Says Fertilized Egg Dispute Amounts To Custody Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman at odds with her husband over who should have control of their frozen embryos says the eggs represent life and the case should be looked at as a custody battle. Her husband says the eggs represent his future and that he should be allowed to determine if he becomes a father or not. The courts do n't know what to say as there is n't much precedent concerning in-vitro fertilization and divorce. `` I consider them life,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 28, said of the eggs that she and <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> placed in frozen storage a few years ago as part of the in-vitro fertilization program at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. `` If I can not have them, then I'd like to donate them to another person,'' she said in an interview Saturday at the couple's log home in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 30, filed a divorce petition last month that also asked for a temporary restraining order preventing his wife from having any of the seven eggs implanted. The document called them joint property. <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> quickly granted the order as attorneys searched for any court rulings that could guide them. No further court dates have been set. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said his wife's ability to have the embryos implanted after the divorce violates his right to control his own future. He did not ask that the embryos be destroyed. It's unsettling `` to know that ... 10 years from now I could be walking down the street and bump into my child and not know it,'' he said. He also objects to Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> donating the embryos to another woman. `` I would not let her donate,'' he said. `` If I would not let her have them, why would I give them to a complete stranger?'' The <PERSON> Davises </PERSON> met while both were in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he as a serviceman and she as a secretary. After they were married in 1979, they moved to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> where she works as a service representative at a boat company in nearby <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> and he is an electrical technician for the <ORGANIZATION> Maryville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The Davises were unable to conceive a child and gave up on adoption when they learned their only chances were for foster children, who later could be taken away. They opted for in-vitro fertilization, which involves surgically removing a woman's eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. The embryos are then either implanted or frozen for future implantation. Frozen embryos are viable for several years, the divorce petition said. The chances of a pregnancy are about 15 percent with each egg that is implanted, in-vitro fertilization specialists say. Each implant costs between $ 4,000 and $ 10,000. The couple said they never signed a contract before entering the program and never discussed what would happen to the eggs should something happen to either of them. Such contracts are fairly common in `` test tube baby'' cases. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the eggs are the result of years of surgery, tests and self-administered injections and are her best shot at becoming a mother. `` I would love to be a mother,'' she said. `` I'm not even sure I can go through the program again. It's a very hard process, mentally and physically.'' She also said that if she became pregnant with any of the embryos she would consider raising the child by herself and not seek child support. `` I respect her -LRB- view -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` But the fact remains that she can still have a baby through another donor.'' The only case resembling the <ORGANIZATION> Davises </ORGANIZATION>' seems to be that of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> couple killed in a 1983 airplane crash. The couple, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, did not leave instructions on what to do with the embryos they had in frozen storage. Debate followed as to whether the fertilized eggs should be destroyed, implanted inside another woman or left frozen. The embryos remain frozen and are stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Monash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>' had participated in an in-vitro fertilization program, a hospital spokeswoman said last week.

 Levity has returned to the police barracks in this ailing steel mill town now that residents have raised $ 110,000 to enable nearly half the force to return to work following a week's layoff. `` It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedesco </PERSON>, one of 21 officers who returned to work Sunday following a week-long furlough. `` We're used to being on the other side of the fence. And to see something like this touches a part of your heart.'' The layoffs, ordered by Mayor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> to save $ 90,000, were to last three months. But the fund-raising campaign led by the voluntary ambulance crew in this town 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> netted more than enough money to bring all the officers back immediately. `` As a police officer, you tend to become hardened to life. You deal with the criminal element for so long that you tend to believe there are only two types of people in this world, cops and bad guys,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochman </PERSON>, who was laid off after more than nine years on the force. `` To see something like this opens your eyes again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> McKeesport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> started the campaign with a $ 15,000 donation from its own building fund. Throughout last week, some of the 38,000 residents dropped thousands of dollars into cans at churches, clubs, restaurants and businesses, and people from as far away as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> sent checks and good wishes. By Friday, the campaign netted more than $ 54,000, which Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Equibank </ORGANIZATION> promised to match. `` I would have bet my whole year's pay that they would n't have made it,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>, a clerk on the 50-member police force. Others were n't so skeptical, though. `` People here have seen hard times. They know what it's like to be down,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, who manages a discount store. `` For a town that depressed to get that much money together says a lot.'' Donations have continued to pour in, said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, president of the ambulance service. Fund-raisers from disco dances to polka parties are planned every weekend for the next month. Any surplus money will be saved for next year, she said, so the police department can use it in case of a similar financial crunch. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> ordered the layoffs after state arbitrators awarded the police 4 to 4 -LCB- percent wage hikes. The mayor had asked all city employees to accept wage freezes after the city found itself $ 1.3 million in debt at the end of last year, but the police refused and the issue went to arbitration. New officers on the force make $ 14,000 to $ 14,500 a year, or about $ 6.97 an hour. Although heartened by the campaign, the mayor said the city still must deal with the $ 225,000 cost of the increase in police salaries in 1990.

<DATELINE>LAS VUELTAS, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of the country's rightist-controlled legislature has rejected postponement of this month's presidential elections _ leftist rebels' main condition for participation <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> made the statement Monday, a day after a rebel commander interviewed in this town said the guerrillas are on the verge of a new offensive in the country's nine-year civil war. Prospects for peace had dramatically brightened then dimmed after Jan. 24, when the guerrillas offered to participate in the presidential vote and respect its outcome if given six extra months to prepare and guaranteed security. The rebels boycotted all five previous national elections this decade as shams. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has proposed a six-week delay of the vote, but rebels dismissed it as inadequate. The military called a three-month unilateral cease-fire last week and urged the rebels to do the same. But <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, a top officer of the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that, `` We are ready to escalate the war.'' His force is one of five guerrilla factions united in the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` To say we will -LRB- escalate the war -RRB-, then not do it, would be stupid both militarily and politically. So you can be sure we'll do it,'' he said, sitting on a bench in a classroom off the main square of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vueltas </LOCATION>, a rebel-dominated town in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. Diego is a nom de guerre. Over his shoulder was slung a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle, one of several hundred <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said his group bought indirectly this year from U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` The AKs are part of the military leap we're preparing,'' <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> said. `` It is more potent in terms of firepower. It makes its user feel more powerful, while contributing to the demoralization of the enemy.'' Salvadoran rebel chiefs said last year they were acquiring arms indirectly from the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. But AK-47s, the standard Contra weapon, have never been so evident among Salvadoran guerrillas as during the past few weeks. Contra leaders deny their forces, which have been mostly idle since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cut off military aid 13 months ago, are selling weapons. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s military high command contends <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government is giving AK-47s to the rebels Several reports say the weapon may already be in the hands of up to 10 percent of the estimated 7,000 rebel fighters. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> did not say when the offensive might begin. On Monday, <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> said the constitution blocks any change in the date of elections. `` Just like they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- do not accept the March 19 date for whatever reasons, we do not accept any change in the date, because constitutionally the date can not be changed,'' he told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, the rebels repeated their charge that the U.S.-backed government was procrastinating and proposed direct talks this week in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. The single-chamber legislature, controlled by the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or ARENA, has virtual veto power over any postponement. ARENA, of which <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> is a leader, is favored to win the presidency in next week's election. The constitution says the election must be held at least two months before a new government takes office. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s term ends on June 1. Leaders of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have said elections could be legally postponed and an interim president named by the legislature if a political consensus existed to do so. The civil war has claimed the lives of about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> says a man can take only so much of `` meeting presidents and meeting prime ministers and spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year,'' and is calling it quits after this term. `` You only get one life, and I did n't want to spend the rest of my productive years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the 48-year-old Republican, who describes himself as the most conservative voice in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He said he would return to private life, although he did not rule out a future run for office. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, with two years left on his six-year term, said he was making his decision public now to give potential <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates a chance to raise money needed for the race. `` I have to admit I was very tempted to run again, not withstanding my pledge of old to limit myself to two terms,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` Power, after all, is not only corrupting ... but it's addictive. It's fun exercising power; politics is fun.'' The problem, he said, is `` you get caught up with it, meeting presidents and meeting prime ministers and spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year. ... `` You lose touch with the real world,'' he said. `` I do n't think I've reached that part yet, but I think it could happen in a third term.'' A former airline pilot who never considered himself a politician, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> had never held office before he ran for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 and pulled a stunning upset over Democratic incumbent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. He easily won re-election in 1984, and would have been considered the favorite to win again in 1990 in a heavily Republican state. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> occasionally criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for softening its stance against communism and supporting a congressional pay raise. But his voice has been heard the loudest as an opponent of abortion and the pay raises and as a supporter for the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> rebels. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has consistently been given 100 ratings by conservative groups that monitor <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes and zero ratings by liberal groups. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a `` wonderful institution, but human nature mucks it up an awful lot.'' He complained that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is deteriorating because it is `` becoming more and more powerful at the expense of the presidency.'' `` We used to hear about the imperial presidency,'' he said. `` Nowadays, we're hearing about the imperial <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Mikhail Baryshnikov Stars in `Metamorphosis' on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews; No PMs planned.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> talks! Yes, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> has as much stage presence as a theater actor as he does as a dance superstar. He proves it in `` Metamorphosis,'' a riveting adaptation of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s short novel that arrived Monday night at Broadway's <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON> Theater. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> is fine. But the real star of the evening is director and adaptor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON>, who imposes a theatrical unity on the play that is astonishing. Every component of this stylized production serves the script brilliantly _ from setting to costumes to lighting to music to movement to acting. There is a seamlessness to this production, a quality that also enhanced <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON>'s provocative staging of `` Coriolanus,'' which played recently at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival. Still, most theatergoers will focus their attention on <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>. In his first dramatic stage role, he portrays <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Samsa </PERSON>, a hard-working traveling salesman who wakes up one morning and finds he is turning into an insect, a dung beetle to be specific. You'd expect his physical movements to be superb, and they are. Dressed in a striped waistcoat and knickers and wearing wire-rimmed spectacles, <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> epitomizes <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s beleaguered little man, while at the same time suggesting the insect. He uses his feet, hands, arms and legs to mime his gradual change into the bug. It's a startling transformation, powerful, unnerving, yet touched with pity. But <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> also is in command of his voice, using it to great effect in sorrow _ listen to him call out for his mother _ and in humor, particularly when he munches the food thrown to him by his horrified family. The action, lasting some 95 minutes without intermission, unfolds on a raked stage with black lines radiating across a gray floor. The scenic supervisor is <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON>. A large skeleton of black metal bars shaped like a spider fans out across the playing area. Three spider-like stools are strewn across the footlights. Upstage, above a small ramp, is a cage where <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> spends much of the evening watching his family. There are no props. Everything is suggested rather than played realistically. Three other actors, portraying <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>'s family, share the stage with <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> for the entire play. Each is a distinctive, memorable character. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Auberjonois </PERSON> plays the father, a gruff bully fearful of losing his son's meal ticket, while <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Esterman </PERSON> is right on the edge _ and on target _ as the loving yet fearful mother. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> exudes a steel reserve as <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>'s faithful sister. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreindel </PERSON> and <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> offer fine comic cameos as an outraged chief clerk and a fussy lodger. In a way, they all scurry like insects in a frenzy over <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON>'s hideous transformation. <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON> sees `` Metamorphosis'' as an existential horror story with no way out for the tormented <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> or for the other, almost hysterical characters. The director captures that mood of desolation through dramatic use of lighting, supervised here by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON>. There are several episodes when giant shadows play across the back wall of the set, giving the drama a nightmarish quality. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON>'s music contributes to that tension, building in volume as the family realizes what has happened to <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> and what eventually must be done to get rid of him. <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON>'s production ends on a poignant note. The final image _ <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> curled up in almost a fetal position _ is haunting. But then the whole show is a series of haunting images, pictures that reinforce <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s striking story of what society does to those who are more than a little different. In other reviews, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` It's hard to guess who will suffer most ... devotees of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>, whose story is distorted into Marxist kitsch by this adaptation, or fans of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, whose stage debut as a dramatic actor, however dignified, amounts to little more than a sideshow to the loud circus surrounding him. `` <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> never lets the human dimension disappear, however surreal the situation,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> wrote in the Daily News. `` <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON>, on the other hand, never lets the human dimension appear at all. ... As an attempt to convey <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s world, <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON>'s adaptation is tiresome. As a piece of merchandising, though, it's a triumph.'' `` The <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON> play itself is an expressionist impression of the <LOCATION> Kafka </LOCATION> original _ with little of the finite detail that makes the <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> so chilling and moving,'' wrote <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` ... However, whatever objections one may have to <PERSON> Berkoff </PERSON> as an adaptor, his work here as director is fascinating and unquestionably effective.''

 Well gol-l-l-l-y! Not only was Sheriff <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s hometown of Mayberry mythical; the hometown of actor <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who created the role, has n't existed for decades. Mount Airy has been in a Twilight Zone. As a result of a typographical error, the city's charter was inadvertently repealed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> on March 29, 1967. That means that such official acts as tax levies, elections and town expenditures have n't been valid _ technically _ since then. `` Whoops,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamont </PERSON>. `` Legally, the whole town has n't existed for 22 years.'' To patch things up, <PERSON> Diamont </PERSON> has introduced a bill to validate all acts by the <LOCATION> Surry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> municipality's town board since the foul-up. Legislative officials are n't sure who made the mistake, but believe it apparently occurred in drafting legislation or in putting the law on the books. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, director of bill drafting for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, said staffers recently spotted the error after <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airy </ORGANIZATION> officials asked about a law concerning the appointment of the tax collector. `` We found the disappearance of Mount Airy while doing research,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` I would n't be surprised if there were other missing cities out there.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will provide economic and humanitarian aid to the embattled Soviet-backed government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, officials of both countries say. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> declined to give any details of the assistance, which was announced Monday as he completed a five-day visit. He would not say if it would involve an airlift of food to the besieged Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Most of the Afghan countryside is in guerrilla hands. A spokesman for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also said agreement had been reached but gave no details. The Afghan official accused Western nations of thwarting relief missions. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> airlift of food was halted after one flight last month when airline crews refused to fly to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, fearing for their safety. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, western European nations and their allies closed their embassies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in January and February as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Western allies said they were worried security would deteriorate after the Soviet withdrawal was completed on Feb. 15. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the only non-Soviet bloc nation that maintained relations with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to prop up its client regime. Speaking in <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> through an interpreter, <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> repeated his government's complaints that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were continuing to support the guerrillas who have been fighting to unseat his government for a decade.

 Visionaries in this aging small town wanted to bring profits to <LOCATION> Prophetstown </LOCATION> to save it, so they went out and bought a company. `` We figured if we did n't grow, we'd die,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 58, a hog hauler and president of <ORGANIZATION> Prophetstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which brought <ORGANIZATION> Clear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to this community of 2,100. `` It's going to take something like this to keep small towns alive, revived, or whatever you want to call it,'' he said. `` As you go around <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> you can smell death.'' <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> has eight workers who saw, sand and spray finish on oak furniture patterned after designs of the 18th and 19th century. The furniture sells in 14 states, especially the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. With the federal government's approval, local officials created PMI, sold $ 10 shares and made an offer to <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milsap </PERSON>: You need the capital, we want your furniture. <PERSON> Milsap </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, packed up the company and moved 75 miles from <LOCATION> Granville </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to the banks of the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Whiteside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where they manage the business now owned by <ORGANIZATION> PMI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's very difficult to keep a small town going,'' said <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>'s chief assembler, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Proeger </PERSON>, 34, turning off his electric saw to talk about the company and the future of his hometown, population 2,100, about 140 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I like living in small, rural communities. There's more of a relationship between citizens. In big cities people do n't talk to one another.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, believes the furniture company has boosted the town's pride. When <ORGANIZATION> PMI </ORGANIZATION> was selling stock to make the purchase of <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> possible, it posted signs that said, `` Buy A Share In Prophetstown's Future.'' Many did. `` The spirit has returned,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who noted that residents, many of whom are elderly, recently voted twice over 12 months to raise their taxes. `` People keep their lawns mowed and their bushes trimmed. Pride _ it's an ingredient I sure appreciate. I know it sounds a little hokey, but that's what it's all about.'' PMI hopes to add a few more small companies to <PERSON> Prophetstown </PERSON>'s economy, moves that would depend on the profits earned at <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Clear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 280,000. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is projecting sales of $ 360,000 for 1989, and <PERSON> Milsap </PERSON> hopes to add a second shift. `` Sales have n't been a problem,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Papers Speak Of Rail Safety Crisis After 42 Die In Three Crashes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition lawmakers charged that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government is not spending enough on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s state-run railways after the system's third fatal train crash in three months Forty-two people have been killed in the three crashes, the latest of which occurred Monday near <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> and claimed the lives of two passengers. Forty-four people were hurt when the two commuter trains collided. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> later acknowledged passenger fears of traveling on the British Rail network. `` We have got to allay that concern -LRB- among the public about rail safety -RRB- and remove that concern,'' he said in Parliament. On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured when two passenger trains crashed near <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> station on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts. Thirty-five were killed and more than 100 injured Dec. 12 in a crash involving three passenger trains at <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, transport spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday called for an inquiry into safety `` to ensure that standards are not being compromised in order to meet financial targets that are too tight and demanding.'' Speaking in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> quoted a former <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> safety official, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, as saying safety was being compromised because Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government was `` tight-fisted. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said the government grant to the rail system had been cut by 35 percent in five years, a decrease of more than $ 3.4 billion. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> of trying to score political points. He said government investment in British Rail was running at `` historically incredibly high levels.'' It stands at $ 963 million this year and will rise to an average of $ 1.29 billion a year over the next four years, he said. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION>, the 117,000-member train engineers' union, said government cuts have impaired safety. The liberal <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Guardian, in an editorial today on the three crashes, wrote: `` This is becoming an epidemic ... No one wants money spent foolishly. But if it is a choice between a safe or a more profitable railway, there is not much doubt which way the public would vote.'' The independent Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in a headline, spoke of a `` safety crisis.'' The Conservative tabloid the Daily Mail spoke of a `` growing crisis of confidence'' among passengers.

 Journalists today are generally more responsible than ever, but some `` trash television'' interview programs are `` absolutely, totally useless stuff,'' says <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>. The former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman said programs that depend on the sordid, lurid and sensational endanger good journalism. `` I am concerned about the garbage that is masquerading as television these days,'' <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> said. `` Most of it is real scandal-tabloid journalism ... absolutely, totally useless stuff.'' But, <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> said, `` We're very lucky. ... We have a more responsible press today in this country than we've ever had.'' He said reporters now are much more enterprising and conscientious than during the mid-1940s and several years after, when journalists were passive and practiced `` reporting by handout.'' <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, made his remarks Monday during a news conference to pitch a local water pollution documentary he narrated. He signed off for the last time as anchor of `` The CBS Evening News'' eight years ago Monday.

<HEAD>Troops Kill One Palestinian, 26 Reported Wounded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops shot and killed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager today and blew up the houses of two Arabs suspected of killing a soldier, the army said. Twenty-six Arabs were reported wounded by gunfire in protests. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> doctor said soldiers and border police barged into a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic while chasing demonstrators and clubbed 25 people, some awaiting treatment for other injuries. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hakam </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 18, was fatally shot in the neck and back by soldiers. An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the dead man was one of three suspects who fled from an army patrol, ignoring orders to halt and warning shots fired in the air. He said the man had a record of anti-Israeli activities and was wanted by security forces on unspecified charges. However, residents told an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporter that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was standing on a rooftop when he was hit and said that soldiers gave no advance warning before opening fire. The shooting occurred as the army conducted a security sweep in the narrow, winding streets of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' casbah. About 90 minutes after the shooting, the army said soldiers destroyed two houses near the casbah. The houses belonged to two suspects who allgedly dropped a concrete block on the head of paratrooper <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> on Feb. 24. The house from which the block was thrown was demolished earlier. Today's death brought to 391 the number of Palestinians killed since Palestinians began a revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation on Dec. 8, 1987. Seventeen Israelis have also died. The unrest in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> came in protest of the deaths of three Palestinians on Monday, including the unexplained death of a Palestinian held in a Shin Bet interrogation center. Widespread demonstrations took place in both refugee camps and towns in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where 650,000 Palestinians live. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said 22 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, and there several reports of soldiers beating Arabs. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said four Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the U.N.

Some of the relatives threw stones at soldiers, who chased Palestinians into the clinic, the doctor said. There, the soldiers beat about 25 people with nightsticks and broke windows, a microscope, the office telephone and some syringes, he said. `` They beat some of the injured people we were treating,'' Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said, adding three beating victims suffered factured skulls and were sent to a hospital.

 Relatives and friends of Britons believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to break diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will make it harder to free the captives. `` Hostages' families all around the world will be upset that a major player in this game is now out of the arena,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a cousin of missing <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. `` We will have to sit back and wait, rather dismayed.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided to sever ties at the end of a one-week deadline that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament had set for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to disavow <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew its diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death on Feb. 14. The novel has set off worldwide protests by Moslems holding the book to be blasphemous.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today declared martial law in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> following three days of anti-Chinese rioting by pro-independence activists in which at least 12 people were killed. The measure marked the first time since the Cultural Revolution that martial law has been publically announced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Police slapped a temporary curfew and cleared the streets in the afternoon, threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square or in the Tibetan section nearby, an American witness said. They had fired on protesters earlier today, said foreign travelers. The State Council, or cabinet, said martial rule would be imposed at midnight. The order was signed by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. By early this afternoon, groups of 20 to 30 police armed with automatic weapons, shields and sticks had begun taking positions throughout the Tibetan part of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, telling all people to get off the streets, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> witness said. `` All the Tibetans just disappeared, everybody just evaporated,'' said the American who was given shelter in a Tibetan house. `` All demonstrating stopped.'' n clashes between police and Tibetans demanding an end to Chinese rule over the mountainous and remote southern region. There were no reports of casualties today. Western travelers today quoted Tibetans as saying as many as 75 people died and 300 were wounded. There was no independent confirmation. Martial law was never imposed during previous outbreaks of pro-independence violence in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> over the past 18 months. Police armed with tear gas, guns and machine guns had been charged with subduing the violence. It was last publically imposed during the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution from 1966-76, when bands of Red Guards fought armed battles on the streets of dozens of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. Chinese police today fired on Tibetans for a third day in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and pro-independence activists carried <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s banned snow lion flag around the city's center and lit bonfires of Chinese-owned goods, the tourists said. Tibetans stoned <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> civilians who ventured into the Tibetan section of town. One American tourist said he saw a Chinese man running up the city's main street, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, bleeding from his face and neck. A Japanese tourist quoted one wounded Tibetan as saying hospitals were only treating Chinese, leaving injured Tibetans to fend for themselves. American and Japanese tourists said today's protest march began shortly after noon near the main square. About 50 Tibetans, mostly young, began marching from the square toward <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> with the Tibetan flag. As they marched, they threw stones. The crowd swelled to about 100 as it passed in front of a centrally-located hotel, frequented by foreigners, said an American tourist from <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The protest ended when two trucks carrying 60 armed police dispersed the crowd, Japanese tourists said. The American said he saw three Chinese policemen with automatic weapons charge the crowd on foot. Most of the tourists, who spoke by telephone, did so on condition of anonymity for fear of police reprisals. The protests began Sunday when 13 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns started marching near the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a center of Tibetan Buddhism. They shouted: `` Independence for Tibet!'' Police opened fire, and a crowd of Tibetans began ransacking Chinese buildings. On Monday, thousands of Tibetans flooded the old city. They broke into small <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> - and Moslem-run stores, hauled out their goods, and burned them in bonfires The violence broke out just days before Friday's 30th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the 13th century. Many Tibetans say <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> should be independent and led by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, their spiritual leader who fled to exile during an aborted uprising in 1959. On Monday, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> appealed to world leaders to persuade the Chinese to find a peaceful solution to the unrest. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> have agreed to discuss the Tibetan situation but have yet to agree on a site for the negotiations. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said it will not discuss Tibetan autonomy, which the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> has proposed <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> be granted in its internal affairs.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will have a new death penalty law by Nov. 1, predicts the chief Assembly sponsor of legislation to put the state's electric chair back into use after a 26-year hiatus. The Democrat-controlled Assembly approved a bill to restore capital punishment, following an emotional debate that lasted more than five hours Monday night. On the strength of the 97-48 vote, sponsor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, a Buffalo-area Democrat, predicted his chamber would override a promised veto by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The Republican-controlled state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is certain to do likewise, having approved the death-penalty bill each year for 12 years, most recently last month. The Senate has voted to override <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s vetoes, but the Assembly has n't Monday's 97 death penalty supporters plus two who were absent add up to 99 `` yes'' votes in the 150-member Assembly. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> predicted he would have the 100 votes needed for a veto override by the time the attempt comes, probably in May. `` Certainly it's a whole new ballgame,'' said <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> of the political pressure that will face death penalty opponents. `` I think one of them will blink.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is one of only 13 states without a death penalty law, and the only one among the nation's seven largest states. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s old death penalty statute was gradually eliminated by a series of court rulings, and the electric chair was last used in 1963 <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> favors a life-without-parole sentence for murderers. During the debate, <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> noted that the number of murders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state last year rose to 2,225, an increase of 213 murders from 1987. And pointing out that most of those murders occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> read off a list of what he said were the 20 most dangerous Assembly districts in the state. All were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and all but one were represented by legislators who had voted against the death penalty bill in the past. `` I would n't want to reside in one of these Assembly districts,'' <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> said. `` Not having a death penalty in this state is n't working.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, debating social issues in a new book co-written with Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, says when he was a child his mother resorted to illegal abortions because of Depression-era poverty. Throughout `` His Eminence and <PERSON> Hizzoner </PERSON>,'' which goes on sale next week, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> describes his transformation from a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> liberal to a man who shares views with many conservatives. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> says that a few years before his mother, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, died in 1961, `` she told me that during her lifetime she'd had a number of abortions. ... Her reasons were economic.'' When she was pregnant with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s younger sister, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, his mother `` told me that she tried to induce a miscarriage by jumping off chairs and trunks. It did n't work. When she finally accepted that the child was going to be born, she worried that she might have injured the fetus. `` Personally, I do n't think abortion on demand is a good idea,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> wrote. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has consistently opposed outlawing abortion. When asked Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> about his position, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, `` Women will get abortions no matter what the law is for a whole host of reasons, and I would not want us to go back to the coat hanger, or other home remedies or quack doctors.'' The Post and other news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>, obtained the book Monday. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said none of the views he expresses in the book are new. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who plans to seek a fourth term as mayor this year, denied that the book's publication is meant to shore up his support among Roman Catholic voters. But when asked what impact the book could have on his political career, the mayor said, `` I hope it helps.'' For his part, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> restates his opposition to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s gay rights bill, abortion and giving out condoms and hypodermic needles to stem the spread of AIDS The book, published by <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, costs $ 18.95.

<TEXT>
 Western diplomats said today they expect Moslem guerrillas soon will launch a long-awaited offensive against communist forces who still hold <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s key cities following the Soviet pullout. Insurgents fighting to establish an Islamic republic hint they are preparing a decisive battle to bring down the Marxist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government once spring melts snowbound mountain passes, the diplomats said. `` The battle plans appear likely to be executed roughly simultaneously, with serious fighting expected in most areas during the month,'' one Western source said on condition of anonymity. Guerrilla spokesmen in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said an interim government announced Feb. 24 by the fighters may hold its first meeting inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Thursday. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the guerrillas' main backers, have withheld formal recognition of the rival government until it establishes a capital and begins a functional administration. `` Regime forces are extremely worried about the imminent massive assault by the Afghan -LRB- guerrillas -RRB- in many areas,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> claimed Monday. It said the insurgents have sent clandestine messages to civilians to flee eastern <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> city and the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. Diplomats earlier reported similar notices in the capital. Combined assaults on the key cities of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> in the west will be tricky. Guerrilla field commanders have disagreed over timing and tactics for fear of causing unnecessary civilian casualties. Many have argued for an extended siege to encourage defections in hopes the communists will collapse from poor morale. Nearly 1.5 million Afghans, or 10 percent of the population, have died in the civil war since the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> seized power in a 1978 coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. They withdrew last month after losing 13,000 men. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said commanders based near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> also are concerned about their ability to control outsize guerrilla groups that have converged there. `` -LRB- It -RRB- could become a problem, entailing unnecessary killing and destruction,'' said one source. Combined reports indicate fighting around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is on the rise after a winter lull. The guerrillas claim thousands of government troops have surrendered or been captured since the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers went home on Feb. 15.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lions with a taste for trout are frustrating wildlife officials by swimming nearly 300 miles back to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s ship canal within days after they are trucked off to the ocean.

 <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> says he commandeered an airliner in 1985 on command from his Amal militia superiors in the belief that the act might stop the factional bloodshed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> also testified Monday that he had given a detailed confession to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who arrested him in 1987 because he was seasick, in shock and `` wanted to do anything so that they would just leave me alone.'' An appeals court has already ruled that the confession was valid, although defense attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has sought to convince the jury that it was improperly obtained because <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was ill and without an attorney at the time. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has not yet ruled whether he will instruct the jury to heed the defense argument that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was innocent because he was just following orders. Today's scheduled trial session was canceled because of hazardous conditions caused by snow and freezing rain. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment stemming from the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on June 11, 1985. No one was killed in the incident. The case is a test of a 1984 statute under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asserts `` long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said Monday that on June 10, 1985, the day before the hijacking, he was summoned to the office of <PERSON> Aqil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamiyya </PERSON>, the military commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Amal militia. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said he was introduced to four other men and ordered to lead them in the hijacking. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, speaking through an Arabic interpreter, testified that he received more detailed orders from another Amal commander named <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>. The Amal militia is the military arm of a Shiite Moslem sect headed by <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s minister of justice. `` We were in a state of war,'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said, describing the armed struggle that has engulfed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1975. `` I was following military orders,'' he said he told <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who arrested him more than two years later. `` It served the interests of my people and my country.'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, taking the stand on the sixth full day of the trial, told the jury he had served in the Amal militia for six years before the hijacking, and that he carried out the orders in the belief that `` perhaps my action would stop the war and stop the bloodshed of the youth of Amal.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said, parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were occupied by three foreign armies: the Syrians, the Israelis and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> resistance fighters who had been forced into camps in predominately Moslem <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had split, with a substantial number of soldiers fighting alongside Amal. In the weeks before the hijacking, some Palestinian fighters in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took civilians and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen hostage, he said.

The Express, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s largest English-language daily with a circulation of 1.1 million, frequently carries articles, editorials and cartoons critical of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hari </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaisingh </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> edition, said the raid appeared to be related to business. `` Editorial work has not been affected, mercifully,'' he said. Senior newspaper executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said accountants and other business managers were interrogated by tax agents. One official said the raid may have been prompted by information provided by a disgruntled manager who was dismissed. Today's raids were not the first against the newspaper. Agents raided the newspaper offices in January 1987, shortly after publication of a series of articles alleging a link between the prime minister and a kickback scandal involving arms contracts with foreign companies. Express editors charged the 1987 raid was politically motivated and could not have been carried out without <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s permission. In March 1986, a house in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> used by the newspaper's chairman was raided after the newspaper published a leaked copy of a letter from then-President <PERSON> Zail </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> that was critical of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>

<HEAD>Activists Slam Government On 1,000th Day Of Emergency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-apartheid activists today accused the government of reneging on a promise to release a substantial number of detainees as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> marked its 1,000 th day under a state of emergency `` We challenge the government to lift the state of emergency, because even that has failed to break the resistance of the people,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON>, a former detainee and a spokesman for the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> and other speakers at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> news conference reiterated a call for the government to free all being held without charge. Some have been in custody the entire 1,000 days under emergency regulations. A group of detainees began a hunger strike Jan. 23, demanding to be released or put on trial. Hundreds in custody joined the strike, and Minister of Law and Order <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said Feb. 16 he would release a `` substantial number'' of detainees within two weeks. The government says it has freed 279 people held in South African prisons since then, and more than 500 people remain in detention. The Hunger Strike Support Committee said 202 detainees have been released and about 700 remain in prison. Many of those released have been placed under tight restrictions that limit their movements and prohibit them from participating in anti-government groups. `` Anger is growing among detainees, their parents, mass-based organizations and the community as a whole at <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s failure to honor his agreement,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The general impression created as a result of his talks with lawyers, church leaders and detainees' parents was that well over half of the detainee population would be released,'' the statement added. More than 500 activists in detention have participated in the hunger strike, but most resumed eating when <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> promised the large scale releases. However, detainees in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> have continued their fast and about 50 remain hospitalized nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said. The committee said detainees were considering rejoining the hunger strike and that sympathy fasts were being planned around the country. A spokesman for <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, said the law and order minister was `` looking at each detainee's case individually.'' An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained for varying lengths of time under the state of emergency declared by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on June 12, 1986. The government has banned most black-led anti-apartheid groups since the emergency went into effect. Some 4,000 people have died since widespread unrest erupted in September 1984. Most deaths occurred before the nationwide state of emergency was declared, although there has been ongoing black-on-black faction fighting in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. Police said today five blacks were killed overnight in unrest around the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, where most of the fighting has occurred. The state of emergency gives security forces widespread powers and prohibits most forms of peaceful protest. Censorship rules imposed under the emergency restrict reporting about unrest and actions by security forces, but the measures have not been comprehensively enforced.

 The skeleton of an infant found in a trunk appears to have been a girl who lived about a month before dying of an unknown cause 50 years ago, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubelaker </PERSON>, curator of anthropology at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the age of the baby's remains `` were compatible'' with a T-shirt the infant was wearing that bore the logo `` World's Fair 1939.'' He and the state medical examiner, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON>, said the infant appeared to have been alive for as long as a month before it died and there was no evidence of any fatal injury or disease that might have caused the death. <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said his office is `` listing the cause of death as undetermined.'' The remains were found Feb. 15 in an steamer trunk kept by the late <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> in the basement of her home in this small town about eight miles south of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The skeleton was wrapped in blankets, along with a Bible, a small chest and the remnants of a baby girl's white dress. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>' children, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, 31, told state police that they made the discovery Feb. 15 when they opened the trunk expecting to find their mother's will. When the two were young, their mother had warned them never to play near the trunk, they said. Before she died Feb. 13 of a liver ailment and other problems, the 67-year-old woman asked them to take care of what was inside it, police said. Neither child could remember any family discussion of a sister who died at birth or shortly afterward. <PERSON> Smialek </PERSON> said the examination of the remains did not determine whether Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> bore the child. Detective <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said he has drawn a blank on his investigation. `` Unless somebody comes forward, there is nothing more we can do,'' he said. `` We ca n't even determine if a crime occurred.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> severed diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today and accused <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> of anti-Islamic `` treachery'' for refusing to denounce <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament had given <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> one week to lift <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s diplomatic embargo and `` clarify'' its stance on the book many Moslems consider blasphemous <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> blamed <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for the break. It comes after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> withdrew all its diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Feb. 14 religious edict calling on Moslems to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for insulting Islam. `` The present situation is entirely of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s making,'' said a Foreign Office statement. `` Incitement to murder is a violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that govern relations between sovereign states.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not formally communicate to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> its decision to end relations, the statement said. Relatives of Britons believed held hostage by pro-Iranian radicals in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said they are saddened and dismayed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s move `` Hostages' families all around the world will be upset that a major player in this game is now out of the arena,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a cousin of missing Anglican envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement as saying: `` The world oppressors and the West, which find genuine Islam against their objectives and plots, have risen against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of the British government is salient. `` In the past two centuries, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been in the front line of plots and treachery against Islam and Moslems.'' Iranian clerics have put a bounty of $ 5.2 million on the head of the author, a British citizen born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, went into hiding and is under police guard with his wife, American novelist <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats prompted the 11 other <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations, and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to recall their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> condemned the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> threat. `` This terrorist group is based in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> and therefore ... we call on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to take appropriate action,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> indicated to reporters he wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to take a stronger stand and influence <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to rescind the death threat. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said he and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair in private talks Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. He told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` there can be no justification for -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s -RRB- incitement to murder ... and no justification for seeking to impair the freedom of speech in a country like ours,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. The Soviets have said Western countries are justified in their indignation. They have not condoned the decree, but said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> may have had to act under Islamic teachings. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Saturday she believes the novel has deeply offended Moslems, but her government still insists <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must revoke the death sentence before relations can be normalized. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s statement of sympathy, saying it was insufficient and suggesting <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> defuse the crisis by prosecuting <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and banning the novel. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refuses to do either. Moslems have objected to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s portrayal of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and the book's suggestion the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, was not inspired by <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has said his novel was meant to explore good and evil secularly, and was not meant to insult Islam. Nineteen people have died in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in violence related to the book. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, about 300 Moslems demonstrated against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> today outside the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, as their government prepared to ban the novel. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Pow </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarasin </PERSON> was to sign an order today banning distribution and sale of the book, a police spokesman said.

 Five children died when a bomb resembling a toy exploded in a refugee village on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. The independent English-language newspaper The Nation said a sixth child was seriously injured in Monday's explosion. One of the children spotted an object that looked like a toy, and when they picked it up, the object exploded, the <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> newspaper said, citing unidentified government officials. There was no immediate official comment on the report. More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has been the target of hundreds of bomb explosions. Most have ripped through crowded bazaars in villages and cities in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> that borders <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Most Afghan refugees live in tent villages and sprawling camps of adobe huts in the border province. Local authorities charge <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s ruling communists are behind the explosions. Many Afghan guerrilla groups are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A civil war has raged in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1978. In December 1979, Soviet troops intervened to back the government, but the Soviets withdrew all troops Feb. 15.

 Engineers today swapped out a faulty electronic part on the space shuttle Discovery and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> expressed optimism it could hold the latest delay to two days and launch Discovery on Monday. `` We're still pressing ahead toward a Monday launch at 8:07 a.m.'' said space agency spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. But he said a firm date could not be set until after the replacement unit was thoroughly checked out, a task expected to take several hours. The launch, which had been set for Saturday after three earlier postponements, received its latest setback on Monday when a prelaunch test disclosed the failure of a `` Master Events Controller,'' a vital system that commands separation of the booster rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight. Engineers replaced the failed unit with one borrowed from sister ship <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and then had to postpone testing so that explosive devices throughout the spaceship could be disarmed to avoid an accidental firing. The explosives are fired in flight to separate such things as the spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and external fuel tank form the spaceship. Officials were worried that any extended delay could affect the launch period for the high-priority Atlantis mission that is to propel the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe out of Earth orbit toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said if Discovery, which is to carry five astronauts, could not be launched by March 18, it might have to yield the pad to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, set for liftoff April 28. If <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> ca n't be launched between that date and May 23, the planet will not in proper position again until 1991. Discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years ago. During five days in orbit, the astronauts are supposed to deploy a communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.

 Hundreds of police and security guards held back vengeful relatives today as a confessed North Korean agent went on trial for the bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed 115 people. `` I ` m here to kill you!'' shouted one person. `` Bring back my husband!'' another screamed at <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> as security agents led her into the courtroom. She buried her face in her hands and sobbed. In January 1988, she admitted on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> television that she planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 in November 1987 to disrupt last summer's Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. She also told the court today she had been a North Korean agent. The Korean Air plane flying from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> disappeared over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as it approached the Burmese coast. All 115 passengers and crew were lost. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denies it had anything to do with the bomb. About 1,500 police and security agents guarded the court today to prevent disruption from relatives and possible threats from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents. Crying and sobbing relatives among a few allowed into the courtroom interrupted the hearing repeatedly, demanding the defendant's death. Twenty security agents surrounded her. Some relatives shouted claims that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> actually was a South Korean agent used by the government to discredit the north and stir up support for the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> administration. Prosecutor <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kang-min </PERSON> reviewed <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s life story, questioning her about her training as a North Korean intelligence agent. The accused sat slumped forward, replying `` yes'' to all the questions. The defendant repeated an earlier statement that she received the order to blow up the plane through a top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official who said he acted for <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, son and political heir of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> presented charges of mass murder, destruction of an aircraft and violation of national security and civil aviation laws. The court adjourned until March 21, when defense lawyers will present their case. Court sources who declined to be identified said the woman probably will be saved from the death sentence because she allegedly was duped by North Korean intelligence. The bomber has said North Korean officials fooled her into believing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was a police state, but she realized she was duped after she was brought to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Other captured <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> intelligence operatives have been pardoned and used as propaganda symbols against the north. The defendant and an elderly man who helped her plant the bomb were arrested shortly after the blast in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. They tried to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent died. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> recovered and was extradited. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> successfully hosted the Olympics last September. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> boycotted after it unsuccessfully demanding to be a co-host of the Games, which it saw as a major political coup for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The two Koreas have been enemies since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in 1945.

 Rain, sleet and snow pelted the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, threatening to push streams over their banks in already drenched <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today after heavy snow forced the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and stopped the mail in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The weather was blamed for at least 24 deaths, with nine in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, including three people who collapsed after shoveling snow. The storm caused millions of dollars in damage to poultry operations in a four-state region as poultry houses collapsed under the weight of the snow. The bad weather also forced President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cancel a trip today to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. Up to 10 inches of snow kept some schools in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> closed today. Schools also were closed today in parts of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, because of icy roads. A storm system over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> brought rain and snow to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seaboard early today. Snow extended from the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` The ground is very wet and saturated,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` It wo n't take much in the way of additional rain to produce a quick rise on some of the smaller creeks and streams.'' Rain caused flooding across southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, closing roads in 14 counties, and in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, about 120 families were forced to evacuate from along the swollen <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harpeth </PERSON> rivers.

The heaviest snowfalls _ 16 inches _ were recorded in parts of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Up to 10 inches covered the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountains </ORGANIZATION> of western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Monday. The Missouri Legislature canceled Monday's and this morning's sessions because of the storm Nine inches of snow snarled traffic in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, prompting even the intrepid <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service to call off most deliveries Monday. `` Today our rule of thumb is, if the carriers can deliver by walking from the station they will. If they have to drive, forget it,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, director of city operations for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service. Ice on Interstate 35 north of <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, caused a 20-mile long traffic tieup this morning. Icy runways forced <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lunken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which handles mostly commuter and private flights, to continue diverting arriving flights elsewhere. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area received 11 inches of snow, the third largest accumulation for a 24-hour period in March since record-keeping began in 1874. That prompted election officials in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to ask a judge to postpone today's primary for a week. The request was turned down by Municipal Judge <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who looked out an office window Monday afternoon and noticed that the snow had stopped. Government officials said reports indicated that as many as 700 poultry houses in southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> were damaged. `` This could be the single biggest disaster ever to hit the poultry industry,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Siloam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, which processes about 1.5 million chickens a week. `` We've suffered major losses in summer heat waves, but I'm not aware of a single larger loss in terms of property and I've been in this business for 20 years.'' Weather-related deaths included one in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, from a fire started by lightning, nine in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Icy pavement and blowing snow hampered travel in many areas. The weather slowed commuters in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area who had thought they were home free Monday after a judge barred `` sympathy'' walkouts by railroad workers in support of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed today that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May and discuss the possibility of a superpower summit meeting. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would complete its review of its strategic nuclear arms policy next month and afterward a date might be set for the resumption of negotiations to slash missile arsenals. `` I am pleased with this meeting,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters outside the residence of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grunwald </PERSON>. `` I believe ... that there will be good cooperation between us. Maybe this is the most important conclusion.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would be used to discuss the future agenda for the superpowers and `` the prospects for a summit meeting.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, speaking after <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, also stressed some sharp differences between the two sides. He objected specifically to the Soviets' proposal to try to curb <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact battlefield nuclear missiles in new arms control negotiations that open Thursday and on a Soviet drive to hold a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference. `` The situation cries out for some hard work on the ground,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in explaining why he did not think the time was right to try to get <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> together at the table. On the combat aircraft issue, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted the mandate for the arms talks specifically exclude battlefield nuclear weapons and naval forces, which <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Monday would have to be the subject of negotiations in the future. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said he took issue with what he called recent `` Soviet posturing on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' He declined, however, to specify what his objections were to Soviet policy toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> recently paid a visit. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with the West have chilled over the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of the novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous. In his speech to the current 35-nation Foreign Ministers' conference Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said there `` should be no playing on contradictions'' such as `` the West's difficulties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters under rules that barred identifying him, later called that remark snide. It was evidence of old thinking rather than the new dogma the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> professes now guide its foreign policy, the official said, suggesting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should condemn <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The two men met for 67 minutes alone with their interpreters. Their delegations then joined them for a further hour. On the strategic arms negotiations that were due to resume in February but remain suspended, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would complete its policy review by the end of April. This will pave the way to set a date for the resumption of the talks at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the Soviets had suggested April or May as firm dates for the resumption of the strategic arms-reduction talks. On the differences between East and West proposals for the new conventional arms control talks, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also noted significant gaps between the two positions but added: `` Negotiation is negotiation. It is a complex process and I believe that in this process we will be able to find mutually acceptable decisions.'' The new round of arms-reduction negotiations formally begins Thursday, bringing together all 16 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the seven Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries. On Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> outlined a three-phase proposal that calls for both sides to eliminate imbalances in their forces and then further reduce troops and major weapons systems by 10 to 15 percent over the next two to three years. The broad Soviet proposals seemed certain to open up splits between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Kremlin reforms and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s apparent new willingness to disarm have already led some west Europeans to question the purpose of the Western military alliance. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has said it wants to retire at least 25,000 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks. Only then would both sides reduce armor, artillery and personnel carriers by 5-10 percent. The Western alliance says the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has at least a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery, even after President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge in last December to unilaterally remove 5,000 tanks and 50,000 men from eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1991.

 One of three city judges charged after a federal bribery investigation pleaded guilty today in a deal that set her maximum sentence at five years in prison, court officials said. Recorder's Judge <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was to have gone on trial today in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges of accepting $ 9,000 in bribes to fix two criminal cases and arrange for a convict's early release. The indictment also charged her with failing to report income from the bribes. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of extortion of $ 5,000 and to signing a false tax return for 1984, said a court spokeswoman who would not give her name. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> had faced 20 years in prison if convicted of bribery, and three years for filing a false tax return. No sentencing date was set. In the other bribery cases, a state district judge is serving a 10-year sentence and another judge was acquitted last week of four bribery charges but a mistrial was declared on a racketeering charge.

 The leader of a <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction today said his group would increase guerrilla attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying such actions were not included in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s renunciation of terrorism. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference `` there is no resolution -LRB- by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... providing for a truce in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between us and the Israelis.'' He said his guerrillas `` will not only keep up the armed struggle, but also will escalate it and diversify its forms and methods.'' He did not elaborate. His organization is the second-largest faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. In December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ended a 13-year ban on public contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and initiated dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> after he renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s announcement was more explicit than a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, in November. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, has said military operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were not considered terrorist acts. But he recently indicated he would be willing to negotiate a truce in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said guerrilla attacks in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could have a negative impact on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> dialogue There has been no progress in the talks since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took over in January. Since December, guerrillas have clashed three times with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and their allies in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Ten guerrillas have been killed in the shootouts, but no Israelis have been hurt. Israeli officials have said that in all three cases, the guerrillas were planning to infiltrate into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but were uncovered while still in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up the buffer in 1985 when it removed the bulk of its forces, three years after invading <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 At a White House news conference called after a snow and ice storm forced cancellation of a quick presidential trip to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said free collective bargaining, not a government-imposed strike delay, is the best way of resolving the Eastern strike.

 The judge in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> case has leveled scathing criticism of the government's handling of memos written by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier to the Contras. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> issued an order saying that government intelligence experts sometimes classify material which is already being accurately reported in the news media. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> concluded in the order that he may disregard claims of classification that are `` frivolous.'' The judge's six-page memorandum issued Monday denies a motion by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to dismiss the indictment against the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, but it is a strong attack on government procedures for classifying information. On Feb. 27, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers were notified by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s attorney that uncensored versions of classified memos by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> on the Contras had been turned over last June to a private group in a civil suit. North's lawyers were using some of the memos to cross-examine <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> on the witness stand and were seeking to disclose some of the names in the censored memos. Names of foreign officials and intelligence operatives were blacked out. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer told <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys he had told prosecutors on Feb. 10 in the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> about the memos becoming public. Informed at the time were office security chief <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON>, prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwhich </PERSON> and another attorney in the office. <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer to turn over the memos, but he refused and no one in <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office took any further action until Feb. 27 when the private group, the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, announced its intention to publicize the uncensored text of the memos. <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON> `` made only a half-hearted attempt to retrieve copies of the memoranda,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` He made no attempt to retrieve them from the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON>'s `` boss at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was out of town and he simply did not act,'' said the judge. `` He never advised trial counsel of his inaction and he never pursued his authority to resolve the matter one way or the other. He proved incompetent for the task assigned to him.'' <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON> `` also failed to follow up. ... He let the matter slip his mind under the pressure of trial preparation.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that with regard to classifying material, the executive branch `` has frequently ignored the requirements'' set out in a presidential executive order. `` It is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have been classified from the outset were not classified in any way, at certain agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the judge. `` No effort was even attempted to follow precise directives found in the Executive Order, either by the agencies or by the interagency group'' of intelligence experts. `` This has resulted in a haphazard process of review of non-classified materials to determine what can now be released publicly,'' said the judge. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the conscientious work of the interagency group of classifying and declassifying at the same time `` has created uncertainty as to the status of many papers.'' He said the <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> memos reflect `` difficulties that arise when necessary procedures for control of national security data are observed in the breach. Among other things, it leads to the often absurd situation where the press is accurately reporting information in the public domain while the court is confronted with representations that the same facts must never be officially acknowledged.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in a case involving accused terrorist <PERSON> Fawas </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, concluded that the court may disregard claims of classification that are frivolous. `` The court will do so hereafter should an occasion warrant,'' concluded <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. Meanwhile, prosecutors are outlining <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s links with a conservative activist convicted of illegal fund-raising for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. The case lost a round to the weather today as snow and freezing rain here forced a suspension in the trial along with other proceedings in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Spitz'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> testified Monday about how he set up a foundation, which eventually was used to solicit tax-exempt contributions for the guerrillas fighting the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> was convicted in April 1987 of conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by illegally using the tax-exempt foundation to support Contra military activities. One of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a White House aide at the time, is that he helped in the fund-raising effort. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said that in 1985 he succeeded in getting two letters from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> authorizing him to be a fund-raiser. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>'s group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, used White House briefings and private meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to persuade private contributors to make donations. It raised more than $ 10 million.

 Electing a successor to socialist <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s mayor, a push to bring back the death penalty and a host of environmental issues were on the agenda today as <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> observed its annual Town Meeting Day. Voters braved wind chills of 43 degrees below zero to travel to their local town halls and settle affairs for another year. In <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, turnout was described as light to moderate. `` Maybe their cars, some of them probably would n't start this morning,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulin </PERSON>, an office assistant in City Clerk <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>'s office. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, population 38,000 and the nearest thing <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> has to a big city, will be choosing between a liberal Democrat and two candidates further to the left to replace <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. The 47-year-old mayor, nationally known for outraged rhetoric against American corporate capitalism, is taking leave from politics, at least temporarily, to teach and write. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, who eschews the socialist label but is running under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, is favored to win over Democrat <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> party candidate <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> initially angered many <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> backers by ducking even the Progressive label, calling himself only an `` independent'' in his first batch of campaign literature. But lately he has more clearly articulated the activist politics he helped execute as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. In about three dozen towns around <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, residents will be voting on a non-binding resolution asking the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the death penalty, last used in the 1950s. On Monday night, at least six towns approved the death penalty resolution. It was tabled in one community and rejected in three, including <LOCATION> Rockingham </LOCATION>, where residents said they were afraid of sending an innocent person to the electric chair. At least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental conservation commissions. Nine communities already have such boards, which are volunteer groups created to protect a town's natural resources. In several other communities, voters may authorize selectmen to create funds with local taxes to protect land resources such as farmland, waterfront property and scenic areas. Several towns approved resolutions expressing worries about a proposed pipeline to bring natural gas from western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rockingham </LOCATION>, where the proposed line would go through a historic cemetery and two church parking lots, residents approved a resolution to examine the safety and economic need for the line. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, residents approved a resolution giving them a say if the state tries to locate a proposed 15,000-seat sports and arts complex in their town. Proponents want the complex to keep the Volvo International Tennis Tournament in the state.

 Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> today met with Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and later reported progress in monthlong negotiations between the opposition and communist government. He announced the last session of the talks would be held April 3, and various working groups composed of experts will finish putting the final touches on the accord by March 20. The period between March 20 and April 3 would be devoted to reviewing the agreement, he said. `` All basic problems, like pluralism, ... will be achieved in time, in line with our commitments,'' said the Solidarity leader, looking cheerful after the eight-hour meeting with the leader of the government side in the talks. `` I am very satisfied.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> indicated agreement was reached on legalizing the three main banned independent organizations at issue in the talks _ the Solidarity trade union movement, the farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Agreements on `` all those organizations, a mininum of three'' will be achieved, he said. He said further talks with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> might be necessary. `` We are removing obstacles that have appeared here and there. But we are only removing them politically, and the rest must be worked out at the -LRB- various working group -RRB- tables,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke outside the Roman Catholic episcopate in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after returning with a vanful of advisers from the meeting in a secluded government villa outside the capital. The session came the morning after a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> session that gave Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> qualified support for his policy of rapprochement with the opposition, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Urban described Monday's meeting of the party's governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as `` very difficult.'' He said committee members `` expressed different fears and doubts, remembering the events of 1981,'' when Solidarity grew in membership to include one of every three Poles and pressed its demands with general strike threats. Authorities suppressed the free trade union movement in a December 1981 military crackdown, ending its 16-month legal existence. `` The general outcome of the meeting -LRB- Monday -RRB- was approval for the party leadership,'' Urban said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the interior minister also met Thursday and agreed that the talks, aimed at restoring the Solidarity's legal status and producing a consensus for guiding the country out of economic turmoil, should move more quickly. The two sides are in general agreement on the outlines of a national compromise: legalization of Solidarity in exchange for the opposition's participation in early elections that would guarantee the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a continued majority in parliament. But several obstacles have appeared, including the authorities' hesitation to legalize the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, disagreement over a program to index wages to inflation and how much access the opposition is to be given to the state-controlled mass media

 A car bomb exploded near the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, killing two women and injuring 21 people, police said. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, a staunch ally of the Syrians who police west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, blamed the blast on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The explosive-laden yellow <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> blew up in front of a fruit and vegetable stall at an intersection off a main commercial thoroughfare. One of the victims was killed as she maneuvered to park her car near the stand, police said. Another woman died at the hospital, said a police spokesman, who under standing regulations is not identified. The explosion started a fire involving several parked cars and shattered glass in surrounding buildings. Three people were evacuated by ambulance, and the police spokesman said `` civilians carried most of the casualties on their backs to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hospital,'' several hundered yards away. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> charged at a news conference that the bomb was part of a campaign by the Christian cabinet to choke private militias in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Those who are trying to encircle us, today sent us a booby-trapped message,'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> told a news conference at his family's ancestral palace in <LOCATION> Mukhtara </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Tensions between <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem cabinets have increased since Monday, when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered the army to block merchant ships trying to dock at militia-controlled ports instead of those run by the government. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said his move will cut off the main revenues of private armies. But his Syrian-backed Moslem rivals view it as an economic blockade of Moslem regions. At the scene of the blast, a witness who also spoke on condition of anonymity said he was in a building 150 feet away when the blast occurred. It shattered windows there. `` I was having my coffee. First, I felt the glass crumbling down, then I heard the blast.'' He said when he looked out of the window, he saw fires and a body lying in the street. Gunmen fired their rifles in the air to make way for the ambulances. It was the fourth car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 11 people have been killed and 47 wounded in the previous three car bombings since Jan. 13. Last year, 116 people were killed and 488 wounded in 20 car bomb explosions across the country, plagued by a 14-year-old civil war. No group claimed any of the explosions, but Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> officials have blamed each other's militias for them.

<HEAD>Soviet Nuclear-Powered Refused Three Port Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Soviet Far Eastern ports, wary of nuclear power after the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> disaster, have refused to allow the docking of a nuclear-powered merchant ship that a newspaper today compared to a `` homeless child.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said the 858-foot-long Sevmorput has been anchored off <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> for four days because the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> refused it entry. The newspaper said city officials will not allow the ship to dock until they receive additional information about its radiation safety. Officials of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Nakhodka </LOCATION> and the coastal <LOCATION> Magadan </LOCATION> region have also rejected port calls by the ship, the newspaper said. The newspaper said fractures recently appeared in the $ 260 million ship, but that its `` atomic heart'' was not damaged. It did not say how the damage was inflicted. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON> said the vessel was like a `` sea monster'' and a huge `` offended homeless child.'' On Saturday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> reported that a nuclear reactor meltdown nearly occurred last fall aboard another nuclear-powered ship, the icebreaker <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON>. Public opposition to nuclear power has been mounting in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. At least 31 people were killed in the accident, and a cloud of radiation spread worldwide.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Well, as you know, we got canceled out of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> today, and so I thought it might be an opportune moment to stay indoors, take a few questions. The <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> trip has been rescheduled for the 22nd of March, and I look forward to going there, talking to the people and really discussing that community participation on drugs. I want to take this brief opening statement opportunity to restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best means of resolving the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its unions. I continue to feel it would be inappropriate for the government to intervene and to impose a solution. This dispute has gone on for more than 17 months, and it's time for the parties involved to get down to serious business and reach an agreement. The action-forcing event in this case is the strike, and that is the tool at the disposal of labor, and they're properly going forward with that. Management and labor now have to find a settlement. But let me just say that I hope my position on secondary boycotts is well known. Thankfully, these boycotts have not yet materialized, and I hope they do n't. Temporary restraining orders have been in effect yesterday and today in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> areas. But even when those restraining orders lapse, I remind all parties that secondary boycotts are not in the public interest, and I will send legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forbid them, if that is necessary. It is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, that you're going to be caught up and victimized by a strike affecting an airline. It simply is n't fair in my view. Secretary <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has been monitoring the situation from the very beginning. In my view _ on top of it. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> have taken every precaution to ensure airline safety during this period. And I understand that the pilots are talking about a work slowdown beginning today. Certainly, I must recognize their special concerns for safety during this period, but I also would urge them not to make the traveling public, the innocent traveling public, a pawn in this dispute. So, that's my view on the airline strike. And I hope that it is settled in the traditional way _ management, labor sitting down and working out an agreement.

<TEXT>
 Wait a minute, we've got to go to the _ Q. Oh! A. Protocol. Sorry about that. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, your struggle to win the confimation of Senator Tower and the seeming lack of direction has caused a lot criticism that your administration is in drift, there is malaise. What is your response and what are you going to do about it? A. My response is that it's not a drift and there is n't malaise. And I talked to a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the other day which was the best phone call I've made. And he said, `` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.'' And so _ and he is a very objective spokesman _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ the guy that _ huh? Q. Do you really think you're doing fine when you _ A. I think we're on track. Q. _ do n't really know where your administration is going with a plan? A. Well, let me help you with where I think it's going. In the first place, in a very brief period of time, we addressed ourselves to a serious national problem, the problem of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout. That is still moving forward. It takes a little time. I've challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act. Secondly, we came up in a very short period of time with a great amount of detail, far more than the two previous administrations, regarding the budget; sound proposals. The No. 1 problem facing this country, in my view, is getting this federal budget deficit down. Not only did we address it, but we addressed it in considerable detail and talks are going on right now to try to solve that problem. I've taken a substantive foreign policy trip that took me not only to three countries, but where I met with, I think, some 19 representatives of 19 countries and talked about their objectives and mine for foreign policy. Our secretary of state has not only touched base with all the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders but has had a productive meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The defense reviews and the other foreign policy reviews are under way. And I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up with bold new foreign policy proposals in 45 days; not going to be. So I think plenty of substantive things are going on. And then I have made clear _ you saw my statement on CFCs on the environment. Our environmental man is over there, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, a very able administrator, attending a conference that will then lead, in my view, to unilateral proposals by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ not in terms just of CFCs, but other global environmental matters. We are confident of the confirmation of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, and he is charged with a six-month mandate to do something _ map out the drug program. And he will be very serious about going forward on that.

<HEAD>WASHN: on that.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 I appointed early on an ethics commission, which has been meeting, and will be coming out with, I think, sound proposals. And so we'll start moving forward legislatively there. I spelled out in my speech an education agenda, and that will be followed, the speech, very shortly with legislative initiatives. We're moving forward with our volunteer approach, this national _ the organization to pursue national service under <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersmeyer </PERSON> here in the White House. Our secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has taken some fact-finding speeches _ trips _ and made some good comments, speeches, about our objectives in terms of the homeless. So I would have to urge _ and everyone here is familiar with my position on child care, that's going to take legislation, but I think the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clearly knows where we want to go there. So I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening. A lot is happening _ not all of it good, but a lot is happening. Q. Mr. President, you mentioned your Asian trip. Now, one of the issues that arose there was kind of a disagreement or a dispute with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over a dissident attending your dinner. And it seems that you failed to raise human rights in your meetings with Chinese leaders. Is this going to be your preference, for conveying harmony rather than confrontation over human rights? A. No, it was raised. When <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> spoke to you at the beginning of the trip there in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and said it had n't been raised, he was right. It had n't been raised publicly in the meetings with _ that I'd had up to that moment I believe <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> was the one where he spoke. But it was raised by me personally. But you know, there's two schools of how you do the human rights agenda. I think that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was correct when he raised the human rights agenda with the Soviets privately rather than beating his breast and doing it publicly. And I think the results have been rather penetrating. There's still a long way to go with the Soviets. But I have not only raised them, but the very invitation to that dissident, that they thoroughly disapproved of, shows our public commitment to it. And there was a reference to it in his speech. So it all depends how you _ how _ in our toasts. So, it all depends, you know, what approach you take. But I think quiet discussion is a good approach to trying to effect the human rights objectives that I feel very strongly about. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>?

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he is open to a `` sensible answer'' to the proliferation of semiautomatic assault weapons and has asked <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, his nominee for drug policy coordinator, to work on it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has said he opposes a ban on such guns. In a news conference today, he said he talked to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> about the problem after <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was quoted as saying he might favor curtailment of such weapons as a way to cut down on drug-related violence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>: `` I'm not so rigid that if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end. He said he wants to find `` what can be worked out with finality on AK47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.'' `` It is n't as easy as it seems,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to have gone to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today to speek on drugs, but the trip was scrapped due to the icy and snowy weather that battered the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began a week devoted to an anti-drug message, appealing to military veterans to help combat narcotics by encouraging drug-education programs and anti-drug legislation at the state and local levels. `` You've fought for your nation once and your nation needs you again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an address Monday to several thousand people at a Veterans of Foreign Wars conference. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.5 billion for the battle against drugs, with most of the money going to law enforcement efforts and border interdiction. His request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is 21 percent more than the $ 4.6 billion allocated for this year. It is $ 236 million more than former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought in his first draft of the spending plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the veterans that drugs were `` a threat no less real than the adversaries you have battled.'' `` The notion that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a nation at peace is only partly true, as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault our communities,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will `` mobilize all our resources, wage this war on all fronts. We're going to combat drug abuse with education, treatment, enforcement ... interdiction and, yes, with our nation's armed services. Speaking of involvement by the military, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` when that prudently can be done and when that's what it takes, we are going to have to go all out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planned to carry his anti-drug message today to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, but a storm along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> caused him to cancel the trip. White House aides said it would be rescheduled, probably for next week. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday that he supports `` lower levels of armaments'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but with a continued backup by nuclear weapons. `` For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its allies, a survivable nuclear force will remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. His comments coincided with a proposal by the Kremlin for heavy reductions in troops and armor in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also urged negotiations to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the continent.

 Q. On that regard, on human rights, will it always be the first thing you mention with the Soviets, as it was under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>? A. I do n't recall it always being the first thing, because the last meeting I attended with him and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> it was raised, but it was n't the first thing. But it will be high on our agenda. I confidently expect that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will continue to raise it. And yes, it will be an agenda item. Q. Mr. President, on the air strike, your opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, many of the Democrats up there, wanted you to intervene in this strike. Should you have to go to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for emergency legislation to deal with secondary boycotts, it is likely they are going to say, `` No, no. We want you to intervene first.'' If the Eastern pilots succeed and the machinists succeed in imposing secondary boycotts, you seem to be on a collision course there. Will your policy hold firm? A. It will hold firm. The secretary is testifying, I think at this very moment, about the kind of legislation you are talking about and some wanting to compel the president to convene this board. So there are two schools of thought. I still feel that the best answer is a head-on-head, man-to-man negotiation between the union and the airline. And I think that is better and more lasting, incidentally _ the agreement that would stem from that _ more lasting than an imposed government settlement which could cause the airline to totally shut down. So I think there could be some, you know, confrontation. But I will stick with my view, and I will keep _ and if, indeed, innocent parties are threatened through the secondary boycott mechanism, I will move promptly with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and what would happen, and I do n't want to buy into a lot of hypothesis here, but you would have an outcry from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people on the basis of _ that I mentioned about that commuter. It is not fair to, you know, have innocent people victimized by a struggle between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. So there may be a different _ a closely-fought contest, and there might _ I know there's some widely differing views on this. Q. But if that should happen, sir, you must recognize that there would be great pressure on you to at least stop it for 60 days. Are you intent on not doing that? A. I am intent on staying with what I've outlined is our administration's policy, and it is the correct policy. And I think it's the best way to have a solution to this question. We'll go right across here and then start _ greater than

 EASTERN STRIKE <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged pilots for other airlines not to slow operations as a way of supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike and thus `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.'' The president stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the walkout, but he said that if striking machinists try to shut down rail service he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban such secondary boycotts.
</TEXT>

 TOWER NOMINATION <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated that he is determined to press his nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense to a showdown vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because `` I want him and I believe he is the best man for the job.'' He noted that Tower has pledged not to touch a drop of liquor if he gets the defense job, and he said, `` You'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that his backing of Tower against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` is n't iron-willed stubbornness; it's a question of fundamental principle here.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 ARMS REDUCTION The president gave a preliminary welcome to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal, made Monday at an <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, for a reduction in conventional weapons and military personnel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cautioned, however, that he had not yet seen Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s cabled report on the conference of foreign ministers from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations.
</TEXT>

 SLOW START <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Tower debate has not immobilized his administration, as some critics are saying. He said the administration is not adrift, `` we're on track.'' `` I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up with bold, new foreign policy proposals in 45 days,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 CONTRA AID There is not much question that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will need additional aid, he said. `` We simply can not and I will not leave the Contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 GUN CONTROL He is willing to be flexible on action to limit sales of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, but the issue is a complicated one, he said. `` It is n't as easy as it seems for those who are understandably crying out to do something.''

<DATELINE>ROCESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A stowaway cat from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> survived a two-week journey by land and sea from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without food or water _ only to be killed when it arrived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because of strict quarantine laws, an official said Tuesday. The cat apparently was locked in a container full of tires in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Staffordshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>'s emergency planning officer. The container made the 3,000-mile journey to an auto factory in <LOCATION> Rocester </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, by ship and truck. The long-haired, gray-and-white cat survived by drinking the condensation on the inside of the sealed container, <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> said. When it was discovered, however, a veterinarian decided it had to be killed because of the rabies risk. `` The risk was slight, but rabies is endemic in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the import of cats and dogs is strictly controlled because of it,'' <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> said. The factory organized a collection to keep the cat in quarantine for the required six months, but the vet declared the cat was in too poor a condition to survive the quarantine period and he killed it painlessly, <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accused South Korean troops of firing machine guns Tuesday at a guard post on the North Korean side of the border and contended it was part of attempts to start a new war. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the firing `` gravely threatened the safety of civilian policemen of our side on routine duty,'' and said their patience prevented the incident from developing into an armed conflict. It said the firing occurred Tuesday morning in the central sector of the border area between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` The gun firing, timed to coincide with the aggressive ` Team Spirit'89' joint military maneuvers staged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> puppets, shipping huge aggressive forces and destruction weapons into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, vividly shows how frantically they are trying to unleash a new war by aggravating the situation on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' the agency said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has demanded cancellation of the Team Spirit exercise this month, saying it makes progress in a Korean dialogue impossible. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials say the annual military exercise _ in which about 200,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops are involved _ is purely defensive. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suspended talks between legislators of both countries in protest of the military exercise. Other talks aimed at arranging the first meeting between both sides' prime ministers also have bogged down because of Team Spirit, but another session is set for April 12.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today praised the naming of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> board of trustees as students continued to occupy the administration building in protest. The students said they would stay until <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, is removed from the board Classes were suspended today due to snow and freezing rain. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if the students at the largely black campus, who question <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s commitment to black concerns, had a legitimate complaint. `` No. I think it's a good thing he's on the board ... I think that'll work out just fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference. No arrests have been made in the latest round of a protest that began late last week. On Friday, students disrupted the university's annual charter day convocation and prevented entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> from giving the main address From as few as 250 to more than 1,000 students were occupying the <PERSON> Mordecai </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Administration building after the takeover began Monday morning, according to varying reports. Reporters were not allowed inside. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a junior who is serving as a spokesman for the protesters, said in a statement that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is `` regarded by students to be opposed to the black agenda.'' The university refused to comment last night on the students' actions or on what steps might be taken A group of students met with <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> on Saturday to discuss a list of demands. On Sunday, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> met with a group of students in an attempt to allay their concerns, according to an Atwater spokeswoman. She said he was unavailable for interviews, but he remained committed to his seat on the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> board. Although some professors and students have praised the appointment as an intelligent move, others have attacked it as poor symbolism. Some of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s critics point to his use of the furlough of convicted criminal <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> to criticize the judgment of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, during <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign last year. `` He masterminded use of the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> issue to contribute to the rising anti-black sentiment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, during an earlier interview. `` And we feel that facilitated the election of former -LRB- <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> -RRB- Klansman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state Legislature.'' Aside from the removal of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, students are demanding a more `` Afro-centric'' curriculum, a better financial aid processing system and improved campus security.

 The Soviet media gave <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> some rare coverage Tuesday, carrying a report on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> first lady's comments on her husband's reforms and how the world's women have improved prospects for peace `` If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all continents for friendship, cooperation and profound mutual understanding of nations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a reception she gave Monday in honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday that will be celebrated Wednesday. Her remarks were reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is shown frequently on Soviet state-run television and has been interviewed by Western reporters, her views are rarely reported in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media or heard by her fellow citizens. It was unusual for <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> to cover her reception for wives of ambassadors and other diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, wives of members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women in various fields. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who captures world attention on frequent trips abroad with her husband, arouses contrary passions in Soviets. Some are curious about the dashing, 57-year-old woman who has changed the role of the Soviet leader's wife into something more resembling that of the wives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents. Until <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to power four years ago, the spouses of Kremlin figures kept a low, often invisible profile, with the exception of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> revolutionary <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupskaya </PERSON>, the wife of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, who was a member of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Many Soviets look askance at Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose wardrobe is large and glamorous by Soviet standards. Others grumble that the former teacher of Marxist-Leninist philosophy is too involved in her husband's work. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recepition gave her an opportunity to share her opinions on both domestic and international affairs. `` Soviet people are putting into practice plans of revolutionary restructuring. We are connecting to it the destiny of our country, of our nation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a reference to her husband's reforms `` We want our public life in all aspects _ socio-economic, political, moral, ecological, and in the sphere of human rights and freedoms _ to be worthy of a human being. `` By transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis, on the principles of humanism and democracy, we are making our country more open for all the nations of the world,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> greeted her guests individually and gave each of them a bouquet, said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, the wife of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>. `` She's a very attractive, intelligent and vocal woman. If they let her speak more often, everyone would benefit,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I hope with the example of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coming here and the television coverage she received here will make it acceptible for the spouses of leaders to think their own thoughts and express them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, who was referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting last summer, was one of several hundred guests at the reception. The Gorbachevs later attended a celebration held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi Theater to mark International Women's Day The ceremonies, broadcast on TV, showed Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returning to the more traditional protocol role of the Soviet leader's wife. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sat on the dais with other Politburo members and dignitaries, while his wife was in the audience. In a dispatch showing the limited political clout of women in Soviet society, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also reported Tuesday that of 2,901 candidates running to represent territorial districts in a new national assembly, only 17 percent are women. Voters nationwide on March 26 will choose 1,500 deputies for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a new body that will elect the Soviet president and parliament. Organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and trade unions are directly electing deputies to fill 750 other seats.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that 25,000 Pentagon employees will provide a `` fail-safe guarantee'' that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> abides by his vow to abstain from drinking if he is confirmed as secretary of defense. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> underlined his support for his nominee, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans accused Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., of improperly reopening the investigation into the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's personal fitness to serve <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had dispatched investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee that he also heads to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to probe new allegations against Tower. He said he did so because he understood the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had ended its own work on the case and was `` out of business.'' As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened its fourth day of debate on the nomination, Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said he found it `` very troubling'' that <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had acted on his own to reopen the Tower investigation using <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` Why are we investigating Senator Tower?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> asked. `` Is n't the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> record adequate When does this investigation stop? <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> later told <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that there were `` three or four new allegations'' and said he had advised Republicans on the investigations panel before acting. He said he had been told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was no longer on the case so forwarding the allegations to the bureau would have been `` an exercise in futility.'' `` There was no other way to check them,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said, adding that iot would satisfy him if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> took over. Republicans, including Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said they found <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s action `` questionable'' and `` inappropriate. Meanwhile today, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that while some other Democrats may follow the lead of Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., and announce support for Tower, there are not enough votes to confirm the nominee <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said also that while some Republicans are talking of prolonging the debate through Easter, he wants a vote soon, `` certainly this week.'' Commenting in the aftermath of <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s decision to support Tower, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said it is entirely possible some other Democrats may follow the senator's lead. `` I feel that when the vote is taken the nomination will be rejected,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` I do not believe there are sufficient votes to result in the confirmation of Senator Tower.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, commenting at an impromptu news conference at the White House this morning, said: `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has said he'll never touch another drop of liquor and he'll have 25,000 people at the Pentagon making sure he keeps his word. I would say we have a fail-safe guarantee.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s decision on Monday heartened Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders, who said they may yet ask the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to let the nominee defend his battered reputation from the floor of the chamber itself. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters today he is prepared to comment on that possibility but will do so only if the request is actually made. Some senators who are not part of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership have said the debate may be extended through Easter. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he will oppose such a lengthy delay. `` It is my hope it can be concluded soon and certainly this week,'' he said. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had not built a persuasive case against Tower. He said he is convinced the nominee would not break his pledge never to drink again if confirmed as the nation's defense chief. He said Tower is qualified for the job by reason of background and expertise in military affairs. But the encouragement <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders drew from <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s announcement was dampened when another Southern Democrat _ Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> _ said he would vote `` no.'' `` I feel this man is going to create rather than solve problems,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> cited the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's lucrative consulting ties with leading defense contractors after leaving government service as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator and as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> announced their decisions shortly after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on Democrats to `` put aside partisanship'' and support the nominee, basing their decisions on their personal knowledge of Tower's 24-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career rather than `` rumor and innuendo.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> is a former chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans said that if someone of <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s background is unconvinced by allegations against Tower in the massive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, other Democrats might be persuaded to follow his lead. The most recent <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found 47 Democrats and one Republican _ Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S </LOCATION>. _ either solidly opposed or leaning against confirmation. Forty Republicans and one Democrat were either leaning for or supporting confirmation. `` We have a better chance, but it's still an uphill fight,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, after <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s announcement. `` We're looking for more good men. Republican leaders met with White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and said later that the possibility of asking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to permit Tower to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to answer questions remains an option. Such a dramatic appearance _ if approved _ would be unique in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 years of experience in judging candidates for Cabinet positions. It would give Tower the chance to rebut allegations that he has drinking problems, has indulged in indiscreet behavior toward women and has opened the appearance of possible conflict of interest in his relations with the defense industry. In making his announcement, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said the president and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would see to it Tower kept his word not to drink if confirmed as secretary of defense. `` John Tower _ if confirmed _ will live in a glass bowl,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said `` No one will be more closely watched. ... His most persistent watchdog will be the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. `` I'm willing to rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove himself,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` Giving one a chance to redeem himself or herself is one of the great redeeming factors of the American way of life.'' In addition to <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has courted Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., who has labeled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower as `` unreliable. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> says he has not made a decision even though he believes `` there needs to be more fairness put into this process.'' Republicans said they are also looking at a short list of other possible Democratic converts, including Sens. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>,

 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, back to <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s question, the sort of sense that's developing that, let's say, the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> fight is sapping you _ your ability to get on with other issues. How long are you willing to fight this fight, let the debate go on? Are you ready to now call for them to have a vote, say today or tomorrow, just to get this behind you one way _ A. No. Q. _ or the other? A. No. Because, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>, in the first place, there's two major principles: Fair play, and secondly, the right of the president to have _ historical right _ to have who he wants in his administration. And I've heard a lot of judgments on Tower based on reports during _ people reading the same report and coming out with different judgment. I want him. I believe he is the best man for the job. There are a lot of historical precedents behind my desire to have him and, you might say, right to have him, barring any very clear reason not to. And therefore, I will stay with it. And secondly, it's the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that controls when they vote or not, and I will leave that to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, both of whom I think are conducting themselves very well. Q. May I ask you _ A. This is a follow-up, yeah? Q. _ a question about the chain of command question, because the senator admits to excessive drinking, which would disqualify him for a job in the so-called chain of command. Does this not disturb you at all, that that's the qualification for a job _ A. No, I think he'll measure up to that qualification. Indeed, he has said he'd never touch another drop of liquor and you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true. So what _ I mean, here's a, I'd say, a fail-safe guarantee. It does n't bother me. And I _ Q. -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- A. No. I think he _ I think when you look at the record and look at the testimony, as I have _ and I have n't had one single senator _ not one _ served with him over the years, say, `` I have seen him. My first-hand evidence is this man is ineligible because of his consumption of spirits.'' Not one. And is n't that a little bit unusual? So I go right back to the president's right to have his choice. Let's keep it on a non-partisan basis. I would just reurge that both Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> have told me, `` Wait a minute. This is n't a partisan fight.'' And I would simply ask that they keep reiterating that to those senators who may not have made up their minds with finality, and let's go to a vote. But I'm not going to pull back on this. And <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>, it is n't iron-willed stubbornness. It's a question of fundamental principle here. And I've spelled out my call for fair play, and I'm going to keep reiterating it. So let the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> work its will. It's not going to hurt. And this concept that you can never work in the future because people disagree with you in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, I simply do n't accept that. Q. Mr. President, you have said that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report guns down the accusations against Senator Tower, and yet you have also said that there can be no release, in practical terms, because of the confidentiality of people interviewed. Have you given consideration, given the problem with the nomination, to asking those interviewed to waive the right of confidentiality so that the public does n't have to take your word for it as to the degree to which this report exonerates the senator

 A confessed North Korean agent said in court Tuesday she planted the bomb that blew a South Korean jetliner apart over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1987, killing all 115 people aboard. Relatives of victims shouted insults as security agents led <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-hui </PERSON> into the courtroom for the opening session of her trial. One relative screamed `` I'm here to kill you!'' and another: `` Bring back my husband!'' The 27-year-old defendant buried her face in her hands and sobbed. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told the court later she bombed the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 on orders from leaders of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> who wanted to disrupt the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The bomb exploded as the plane approached the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> coast Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Her admission came in response to questions by prosecutors. After the prosecution finished presenting its evidence, the court adjourned until March 21, when defense lawyers will present their case. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kang-min </PERSON>, the senior prosecutor, asked whether the order to bomb the plane came from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, son and heir-apparent to North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> replied `` Yes'' in a barely audible voice. Recounting the defendant's earlier confession to being a North Korean agent, the prosecutor said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>'s order was issued through a senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official. He said it the bombing was intended to frighten foreign countries away from the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics. Although Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> had confessed to the bombing in a national news conference a year ago, her trial was delayed as part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s effort to avoid trouble with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before the games. The North Koreans have denied involvement in the bombing. Mass murder and destruction of an aircraft are among six counts against the defendant and she could be sentenced to death if convicted, but indications are that her life would be spared. Government officials have said she probably would be pardoned and used for propaganda against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. One said privately: `` She deserves capital punishment, but keeping her alive is more useful. She is a valuable evidence showing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s atrocity.'' He said other North Korean agents captured by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, including one who attacked the presidential mansion in 1968, had been pardoned for that purpose. About 1,500 police were deployed Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hold back angry relatives and guard against a possible North Korean attempt to assassinate Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. Everyone entering the court walked through a metal detector and was physically searched. Crying and wailing relatives allowed into the courtroom interrupted the hearing repeatedly and about 20 security agents surrounded Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. Two women lunged at her during the afternoon session and guards took them away. Some relatives shouted claims that she was a South Korean agent being used by the government to discredit the North. Prosecutors opened the trial by reviewing the defendant's life and asking questions about her training as a North Korean intelligence agent. She slumped forward in her chair and replied `` Yes'' to the questions. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said she and another agent, traveling on forged passports, planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor when they flew on the plane from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. She and her companion, an elderly man, were arrested in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> three days later and tried to kill themselves with cyanide hidden in cigarettes.

 A. Or the word of the opponents. Yes, we have thought about that, and I'm not sure where our counsel's office stands on it. But I'll tell you that the precedent is troubling, when you take testimony and then _ and then certainly you ca n't go ahead and release. I mean, I just could not do that. And I think it's very damaging in the future. So, I'm saying I have read it, this is my view, and it is _ it's inhibiting because it does confine the debate on the floor But I really worry about the precedent. So, I have not been pushing for sanitization and then release, or for selective release, or for _ I had n't thought about this concept of going to somebody and say, `` Would you release us from confidentiality?'' I think that would chill future proceedings. Let's go back in the back. Right in the middle back there. Q. Mr. President, you mentioned yesterday in the speech to the VFW that this 90-day deadline that you had imposed on yourself for the strategic review might slip because you said that the results would n't be rushed. Is there going to be a new deadline? And is the fact that you do n't have a sitting defense secretary contributing to that? A. I hope there's not going to be any slippage. I want that, I want the budget review, I want the management review completed by then. And look, not having a defense secretary in place, no question that it's an inhibiting factor. But I went over to the bureau the other day in a _ I mean the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ in a trip that was interpreted for one purpose. And what I went over, really, for was a more _ was another purpose. And the purpose I went over there for was _ please understand, we've got to keep these reviews going forward. And I am very grateful to those people, some of whom wo n't be there in a new administration, all of whom _ or most of whom _ have served in the past administration, for seriously addressing themselves to these various reviews. I hope we can make the target. The minute that's made _ the target is made _ and the review comes, then we have a lot of decision-making. But I want to _ I do n't want to be footdragging, and, therefore, I'm going to try to keep the heat on without slippage there. Yes? Q. The head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, is from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Is he a friend of yours? Did he give money to your campaign? And one of his vice presidents is on your staff as head of congressional relations. Is he giving you advice? A. He has recused himself, as I understand it, from the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and he is not giving me advice. I know <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, and in all probability, he gave money to the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign. Q. Does _ A. Now _ a follow-up? Q. Does that influence you in any way? A. No, it does not influence me in any way.

<TEXT>
 When next winter rolls around, no woman need worry that she will be left out in the cold. Italian designers showing their fall-winter 1989-90 collections here this week devote much of their creative talent to coats, from the pratical polo to dramatic capes and elegant dusters. The cut is as generous as it is cozy. Ample sleeves, huge shawl collars, and loosely pleated backs contribute to create a soft flowing effect. Most often belted at the waist, these outer coverings are either cropped at the hip, or so long they can double as street sweepers. The favorite fabric is wool, but leather and shearling also play heavily in the collections, not to mention fur, from fake to extravagant mink. Colors are warm fall shades ranging from forest greens, to vineyard reds and purples, to beiges and browns. The unpractical but dramatically stylish cape, often hooded like a medieval friar's, also makes a comeback. <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genny </PERSON>, who showed Tuesday, midway through the fashion week, count heavily on the coat for winter warmth. <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON> _ the Florentine family known for its town and country chic and its shoes _ presented a chocolate colored duster with super wide sleeves, tied at the waist, and a series of chic car coats with bright gold buttons. On the whole, the <PERSON> Ferragamo </PERSON> collection was very smart and sporty, with trim pants suits in black and white checkered patterns, and patchwork leather blazers and knee-length skirts for daytime, and sophisticated long sleeved silk jersey gowns, buttoned or unbuttoned at the back with gold buttons for evening. <PERSON> Genny </PERSON>, designed by <PERSON> Versace </PERSON> but more subdued than his presentation of micro miniskirts during his own collection Sunday night, presented the most opulent coat wear seen thus far on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway, in his series of lavish mink wraps. These unabashedly expensive creations, made up no doubt of hundreds of skins to create the huge collar, ample sleeve and wide swirling hemline, go against the current conservationist trend for imitation furs in elegant styles, favored among others by <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Moschino </LOCATION>. The Genny collection was snappy and young with a wide variety of pants ranging from man-tailored to tight-fitting jodhpurs, and short-cropped jackets. Skirts were a mere four inches above the knee, a conservative length for flamboyant <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, but still had his trademark tight derriere. Evening at <ORGANIZATION> Genny </ORGANIZATION>'s is basically black, enriched by traditional pearl accessories, or an enticing rhinestone embroidered bustier peering out of a slinky chiffon gown.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will replace <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an administration source said Tuesday. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who recently received a department audit that criticized management and operations of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, is searching for someone to take over the agency, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source confirmed a report in Tuesday's editions of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> would be not be kept as <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. It has been long presumed by department watchers that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, along with most other political officeholders in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, would be replaced. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer close to former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, became INS commissioner in 1982. He was criticized by immigrant rights advocates for being slow to implement the provisions of the 1986 immigration reform law, which provided for massive amnesty for illegal aliens. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> became embroiled in a number of lawsuits charging that it was improperly making it difficult for illegal aliens to obtain legal status under the new law. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> audit, completed two weeks ago, cited <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> for its failure to conduct background checks on many applicants for citizenship and found that 23,000 valuable naturalization certificates had been lost by the agency's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> regional office. The special audit, conducted at <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s request by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s management division, raised `` serious questions which are being reviewed now at the highest levels of the department,'' spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said last week. Besides losing naturalization certifications, which had a street value of up to $ 115 million, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> was cited in the audit for failing to take action two years after investigators had discovered that 61,500 naturalized citizens had not surrendered their permanent resident alien cards.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today urged pilots threatening a sympathy slowdown in support of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike not to `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute,'' and stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the walkout. He said that if striking machinists try to shut down rail service he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban such secondary boycotts. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> responded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to halt the strike by appointing an investigative panel `` would be unprecedented,'' noting that over the past half-century 33 such boards have been named in transportation disputes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said once again that he is determined to press his nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense to a showdown vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because `` I want him and I believe he is the best man for the job.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reminded a White House press conference that Tower has pledged not to touch a drop of liquor if he gets the defense job, and `` you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true. The president said that his backing of Tower against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` is n't iron-willed stubbornness, it's a question of fundamental principle here.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly added the news conference to his schedule this morning after an ice and snow storm forced cancellation of a presidential trip to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. The president gave a preliminary welcome to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal, made Monday at an <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, for a reduction in conventional weapons and military personnel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The proposal was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` It looks to me he is moving toward the oft-stated public position of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in this regard, and that is good,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, but cautioned he had not yet seen Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s cabled report on the conference of foreign ministers from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he would pursue `` linkage'' in his relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said issues are related, and if the Soviets cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in one area, it will respond in another area. `` So there is linkage,'' he said. For example, the president said he would welcome any reduction in Soviet military aid to pro-communist forces in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or an increase in the number of Soviet Jews permitted to emigrate to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, he will welcome that. `` When something good happens, give them credit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There clearly has got to be some linkage.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Tower debate has not immobilized his administration, as some critics are saying, countering simply that they are wrong. He said the administration is not adrift, `` we're on track.'' `` I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up with bold, new foreign policy proposals in 45 days,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president also defended his chief of staff, saying <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor, knows his way around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is doing his job well. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has total confidence in <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. On other issues, he said: _ There is not much question that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will need additional humanitarian aid `` We simply can not and I will not leave the Contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all,'' he said. _ He is willing to be flexible on action to limit sales of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, but the issue is a complicated one `` It is n't as easy as it seems for those who are understandably crying out to do something,,' he said. _ He did raise the issue of human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during his visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but did so privately <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized because the topic was not on his announced agenda. But he said it was better handled quietly and `` I confidently expect <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will continue to raise it.''

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife waved at reporters and held her husband tightly when she arrived home today after spending a month in an alcohol treatment program. Emerging from a car driven by her father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled broadly. `` Does n't she look terrific,'' said the governor, his arm around her. Asked what was the best part of returning home, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` Being with my husband.'' Without missing a beat, her husband added, `` Being with my wife.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52, had been in <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, an intensive residential facility in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, since Feb. 5. She entered the facility after several bouts of excessive drinking at home following her husband's failed presidential bid. Following the family's wishes, the governor's staff was publicly silent about Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' condition and her treatment. The governor's press office has been bombarded with inquiries and interview requests, but no plans have been made for Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to discuss her experience. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was driven home by the governor and by her father. On the way home, she visited with her 5-week-old granddaughter. `` Kitty and I will never be able to thank personally the thousands of people in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and from throughout the country who have written or called with kind words of encouragement and love and support for her during her treatment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. A statement by his office said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expects `` soon to resume a full and active schedule'' but provided no details. One senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration official said he had no reason to believe the treatment was not a success. `` Every indication from the governor's attitude and what he has had to say is that it has been successful and that <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> is going to resume an active, independently fulfilling schedule, following up all the plans she had been making before,'' said the source who refused to be identified. `` Our feeling is it is a private matter,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, the governor's press secretary, said. But he added, `` There may come a time when the governor and his wife decide to make it not a private matter.''

 A rush-hour power failure struck large areas of the capital on Tuesday, causing huge traffic jams, police said. It was not clear what caused the break in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s electric power supply, but it occurred shortly after a nitrogen tank in a subway station started leaking at 5 p.m., according to a police spokesman who declined to be identified. The nitrogen was used as a coolant in an electrical switching box, the spokesman said. The outage affected about half of this city of 650,000, according to a radio report. The city's main thoroughfares became clogged when hundreds of traffic lights failed, and cable television sytems went out. Less than an hour after the failure, several areas were on line again, the police spokesman said.

 Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, this is supposed to be _ the theme of the week is drugs this week, and you mentioned again this morning your commitment to ridding the country of drugs. But your designate for drug czar, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, has said that, as part of what _ the way that he would like to help end drug violence would be to consider a ban on semiautomatic weapons, which is opposed to your own viewpoint. And we're getting more and more evidence from doctors and police that there's gunfire in the streets and wounds that they have n't seen since the Vietnam War, because of these weapons. What do you say to people whose families have _ family members have been maimed by these kinds of weapons? A. I say the same thing I say to a person whose family has maimed by a pistol or a explosive charge or whatever else it might be _ a fire _ this is bad, and we have got to stop the scourge of drugs. And I talked to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> about that, because I said, `` Bill, what can be worked out with finality on AK-47s? What can be done and still, you know, do what's right by the legitimate sportsman?'' I'd love to find an answer to that, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, because I do think that there has to be some assurance that these automated attack weapons are not used in the manner they're being used. So I'd like to _ and I told <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>. I said, `` Look, I _ do n't worry about what you said up there.'' I said, `` I can identify with what was behind your thinking on that very, very easily.'' I'd like to find some accommodation. The problem, as you know, is that automated AK-47s are banned, and semiautomated are not. So in they come; and then they get turned over to automated weapons by _ through some filing down. It is n't as easy as it seems to those who are understandably crying out, `` Do something. Do something.'' But I've tasked Bill; I've said, `` Bill, work the problem. Find out. And I'm not so rigid that I ca n't, if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns I've felt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it and I'll work with you to that end.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, do you support the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to make <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> its No. 1 target next year?

Let the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do its thing, and I'll just stay right where I am plugging away on a matter of principle for a battle that's going on in the _ I'll let you know if I want to take on any more. Yeah? Q. Mr. President, on foreign policy, there's some confusion over how you feel about linkage, about linking Soviet good behavior, particularly in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to granting them technological transfers and economic credits. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> helps you in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, specifically <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, are you willing to help him economically?

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has concluded that attacks by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas against Israelis in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were not acts of terrorism requiring a break-off of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, aboard <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plane on the way home from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said Tuesday concerning what should be labeled terrorism, `` We make a mistake if we define that too closely.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked at his news conference whether <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in refusing to criticize the raids, was backing down on his condemnation of terrorism. `` I hope not, and I'd like to see him forthrightly condemn any terror that might be perpetrated by the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered. `` I stop short of saying he's condoning it or that he is furthering it; I'm not saying that. But I'd like to see him speak out. It would do wonders, it would be very good for a future dialogue.'' When the questioner asked if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was jeopardizing the current dialogue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` To the degree terroristic acts are condoned, it does n't help the dialogue.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last December to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Since then <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have conducted at least three raids against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces _ raids the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government contends were aimed at infiltrating <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including then-Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, had said at the onset of the dialogue that it would be suspended if terrorism recurred. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> subsequently warned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the attacks could hurt the talks and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to resolve the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Last Friday the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> questioned <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s commitment and whether he wanted to control <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions that carried out the raids. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership can not or will not exercise such control, it raises questions regarding the commitments undertaken in the name of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, indeed questions about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to carry out their commitment,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The strong statement appeared to suggest the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was reconsidering the dialogue. But as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flew home from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where he had met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, that impression dissolved. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s view `` is that the dialogue should continue,'' the official said. `` It is important.'' For <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, he said, `` the real test is terrorism.'' We make a mistake if we define that too closely.'' The official recalled the late <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s observation that he could not define pornography but would know it when he saw it. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s view on terrorism was described to reporters as similar to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s on pornography. For instance, the official said, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> considers the attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine headquarters near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in October 1983, in which 241 Marines and sailors were killed, as an act of terrorism.

 A. Look, the more cooperation we can get on regional objectives, our regional objectives _ in this instance, the democratization of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ the more help we can get towards that end by the Soviets with pulling back their large amount of military support, the better it would be between relations. So, there is linkage. But when it gets to the specifics of what I'll be willing to do, that'll come out under this whole policy review. But we are not going to back away from agenda items, including regional tensions. And when something good happens, give some credit. When the Soviets come out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which happened here not so long ago, give them credit for that. When you get lightening up a little bit on the question of Soviet Jews or something of that nature, give some credit. So, there is _ I do n't know exactly how to help you in terms of how much linkage there is, but there's clearly got to be some linkage. Q. Sir, have you been getting the cables back from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> from Secretary of State <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>? He's been meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Is <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> saying anything encouraging along this line? A. Well, I have n't gotten _ I had n't seen the overnight cable from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reporting on that meeting so I ca n't comment. I read some reports of what <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in terms of conventional forces, and it looks to me like he's moving towards the oft-stated public position of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in this regard, and that is good _ where it's not a question of numbers you take out, it's a question of numbers that are left when you finish taking troops out. So, I think there's been some encouraging _ but I have not yet seen the Baker report, and I have n't talked to him since his visit. Yes? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, non-military aid to the Contras will run out at the end of the month. Do you plan to propose new aid to the Contras and some package of carrots and sticks for the Sandinistas? A. Well, I hope there are some _ I hope there is some understanding on the hill that these people must not be left without humanitarian aid. And we have already, through the secretary of state before he left, pointed out that that was my inclination, was to strongly support the appeal for humanitarian aid. We simply can not, and I will not, leave the Contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all _ ability to stay alive at this juncture. Q. But will you _ would a package include some promise of renewed military aid, depending on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' behavior at this point? A. We are talking, as I think the secretary said the other day, about how best to move the process of democratization forward. Had a very interesting talk with Mr. <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> on that. And I'm hopeful that before the 90-day period is up, you know, on the presidents coming out, that we can get some very clear statements.

 Engineers Tuesday replaced a failed electronic part on Discovery with one borrowed from sister ship <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to launch the space shuttle and its five astronauts on Monday. `` We're still pressing ahead toward a Monday launch at 8:07 a.m.,'' said space agency spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. But he said a firm date might not be set until Wednesday, after the replacement part had been thoroughly checked out. The launch, which will deploy a $ 100 million communications satellite, had been set for Saturday after three earlier postponements. But it received another setback on Monday with the failure of a system that commands separation of the two booster rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight. Engineers replaced the unit with one from space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and began the testing of it on the launch pad Tuesday. The unit detonates explosives in flight to separate such things as the spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and fuel tank from the ship. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has said if Discovery is not launched by March 18, it might have to yield the pad to space shuttle Atlantis, which is set for liftoff April 28 on a high-priority mission in which it will propel the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> must be launched between that date and May 23 because the planet will not be in proper position again until 1991. Discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years ago. During five days in orbit, the astronauts are scheduled to deploy a communciations satelllite and conduct medical and scientific experiments.

 <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON> may be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. He cited a fan from the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city on Tuesday in defending the beginning of his administration, which some critics contend is getting off to a slow start. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House news conference that he had `` talked to a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the other day. ... And he said: ` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.''' The reference to populatiry in a smaller city in the nation's midsection evoked memories of the phrase `` Will it play in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>? which became popular in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. If <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> is to replace <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> as the standard for middle <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> acceptance, let's see how the two compare, based on statistics reported in the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s `` County and City Data Book: 1988.'' <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> is physically bigger, with 106.3 square miles of land compared to just 42.2 square miles in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> has more people too, outnumbering its <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> companion 186,400 to 110,290. But <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> is a bit more crowded, at 2,614 people per square mile compared to 1,754 in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. The two cities are diverging in size. From 1980 to 1986, the Sun Belt city of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> saw its population grow 7.2 percent. Over the same time, <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> lost 11.2 percent of its residents. In racial breakdown, the cities are somewhat similar. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> has a population that is 81 percent white and 17 percent black, while <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> is 81 percent white and nearly 19 percent black. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> has about 1 percent Asians to help make up the discrepancy. On the other hand, 19 percent of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'s residents are Hispanic, while this group makes up only 1.4 percent of the people in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. Hispanics can be of any race. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> is older, with 12.3 percent of its people aged 65 and over, compared to 7.8 percent in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'s birth rate is 20.1 births per 1,000 people, compared to 16.5 for <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, while the death rate is 9.8 per 1,000 in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and 6.6 for <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> has a narrow lead in high school graduates, 69.6 percent of its residents compared to 69.3 percent in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. On the other hand, <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> counts 22.4 percent of its people with four years of college, compared to 16.5 percent in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. Per capita income in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> in 1985 was $ 11,140, compared to $ 10,452 for <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, with 12.4 percent of the people in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> metropolis below the poverty level compared to 14.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, in the midwestern farm belt, is twice as wet as the semiarid high plains city in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Rain averages nearly 35 inches annually in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> but only 17.7 inches in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> is also colder, with an average January low reading of 13.3 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to a low of 24.3 degrees for <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>.

 But in terms of humanitarian aid, I do n't think there'll be much resistance to that at all. Yeah? Q. Mr. President, on another regional question, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has refused to criticize any of the raids within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that have been carried out. Is he backing down on his promise against terrorism? A. I hope not, and I'd like to see him forthrightly condemn any terror that might be perpetrated by the Palestinians. I stop short of saying he's condoning it or that he is furthering it; I'm not saying that. But I'd like to see him speak out _ it would do wonders. It would be very good for a future dialogue. Yes, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>? Q. Well, is he jeopardizing the dialogue as it sits now? A. To the degree terroristic acts are condoned, it does n't help the dialogue. Yes? Q. There is a school of thought in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mr. President, that perception is often reality, or becomes reality. The perception is that your administration is floundering, that your White House staff is inept. How do you deal with it? How do you turn it around? A. I ask for your forbearance and leadership in this regard, pointing out all the things that I spelled out in the beginning, comparing that in terms of appointments. I've spared you the statistics on appointments which I had prepared, because one of the hits is, `` You have n't sent up any names. You have n't done anything about names.'' And so, I would refer to my notes, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, if that's all right. And I have lost my notes on this _ no, here they are. And in terms of the Reagan-Bush administration, at this juncture, 55 names as of March 6th had been announced. On the Bush-Quayle administration, 67 have been announced. So, it's not bad. We're a little bit ahead in terms of announced names. Now, you've got some different problems here, because one is nomination and the other is intent to nominate. And intent to nominate means there's still some more paperwork to be done. But in terms of who we want in place, we're moving along all right. I'd like to see it faster, of course, but that's one of the allegations _ disarray. First, I have great confidence in my staff, and every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets saluted for his brilliance, and a month later he gets attacked for his something else. And I have total confidence in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. He knows the way this town works. He has a respect level that comes from being a _ and there he is _ -LRB- laughs -RRB- _ a respect level that comes from being a governor. And so, we're all used to this. Hey, this is light compared to what it was like about a year ago in my case, so that's why I still feel relaxed.

<HEAD>Productivity Up Only Barely; Labor Costs Rising Quickly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American workers' productivity rose a barely perceptible 0.1 percent from October through December while unit labor costs, a major inflation measure for business, shot up at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, the government reported Tuesday. The latest news from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed an initial report by the department a month ago which showed that productivity, or output per hour of work, turned sluggish in the final three months of the year while inflationary pressures intensified. The 5.6 percent rise in unit labor costs was almost double the 3.7 percent rate of increase in the third quarter. Unit labor costs reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as changes in productivity. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> last week cited labor costs as one of the factors behind the central bank's recent decision to push interest rates higher in an effort to fight inflation. Analysts said that Tuesday's report, which did not revise the unit labor costs from the initial estimate, would likely add to the central bank's resolve to keep pushing interest rates higher, especially if the report on February unemployment, to be released on Friday, comes in as strong as expected. With demand for workers pushing up against tight labor markets and high factory operating rates, economists are worried that resulting pressures are starting to be seen in rising wage demands by workers and product-price increases on the part of businesses. `` Almost any reasonable person has to be scared about inflation right now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` There is clear evidence that compensation costs are accelerating.'' The fear is that if wage demands begin chasing rising consumer prices, the country could be plunged back into a wage-price spiral similar to the one in the 1970s that then-Federal Reserve Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> fought with the steep 1981-82 recession. The 5.6 percent rate of increase for unit labor costs in the fourth quarter reflected a 5.6 percent rise in hourly compensation, which includes wages and salaries as well as fringe benefits. In the final six months of the year, hourly compensation was rising at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, a sharp acceleration from an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first six months of 1988. Analysts said most of the increase in the final half of the year reflected rising health insurance costs. For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent, matching the average annual gains since the end of the 1981-82 recession. The final quarter's 0.1 percent rise in nonfarm business productivity reflected a 3.7 percent increase in output which was nearly offset by a 3.6 percent rise in the number of hours worked. The weak advance continued a sawtooth pattern in which a strong gain in one quarter has been followed by a poor showing in the next. Productivity rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 1988, dropped at a rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter and then rebounded at a 2 percent rate in the July-September quarter. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said that the 1.4 percent advance for the year, while up from a 0.8 percent increase in 1987, was still a dismal performance compared to the rapid gains of 3.3 percent posted in the two decades following World War II when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a rising standard of living. `` This set of figures reinforces the fact that productivity growth in this country is still very sluggish,'' he said. `` If productivity is hardly growing at all, that means that people's standard of living is not rising either. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is counting on productivity rising about 2 percent a year as a key underpinning of its economic forecast which sees the budget deficit being eliminated by the year 1993. However, many private economists believe this forecast is overly optimistic despite a major push by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry since the last recession to modernize production facilities. Tuesday's productivity report showed that total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity, including the farm sector, fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the continued effects of last summer's severe drought.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in a congressional appearance that in itself signaled a change from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, pledged Tuesday to `` steward <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> into a new era'' and vigorously seek solutions to the nation's housing ills. `` I do n't think there's been a time when there have been more people willing to put aside -LRB- partisan differences -RRB- and try to find solutions to the vexing problems in our society,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in his first testimony as secretary of housing and urban development. `` We'll leave politics until 1992,'' he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who has already toured several public housing projects in an ambitious schedule, outlined a series of sharp turns away from the last eight years and said he's `` willing to be audacious'' in addressing inner city problems. He said his priorities include strong enforcement of last year's fair housing law, the revitalization of what he called the `` Third World economies'' of inner cities and a hope to end homelessness in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` I believe that a dream must be recaptured for our urban cities and for those people, urban and rural, who today live their lives in poverty and despair,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a former nine-term congressman from upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Affairs were as impressed with his appearance as with what <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. His predecessor, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, last testified in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in March 1985 as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> became a battleground over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era spending on social programs. `` Snow, sleet or rain, I think it's very symbolic that I am here today,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, adding, `` We're all in the process of putting aside partisan difference to see what works.'' He pledged to `` implement vigorously'' the law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed last year strengthening federal regulations against housing discrimination. `` I am going to steward <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> into a new era of fair housing enforcement,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` We will try to end, to the extent possible, discrimination in housing.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also promised that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fully fund the McKinney Act, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed last year over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration objections, to provide housing for the homeless. `` This, from a historical standpoint, is something that can no longer be neglected,'' he said. `` I'm not going to approach this from some 18th century laissez faire attitude ... I believe our priority should be to end -LRB- homelessness -RRB-.'' A booster of enterprise zones, in which businesses would get tax breaks for locating in certain areas, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he will push the pet project but bowed to opponents by saying, `` I do n't think of enterprise zones as a panacea.'' `` My mind is open,'' he told the committee. `` My door is open. I want you to know my heart will be open to solutions as well.'' Although most members of the committee lauded <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> warmly, several urged him to seek more money for housing programs and said they'll judge his commitment by the bottom line in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget `` Hope is no substitute for a positive program,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I will hold you to your rhetoric and your claim to do something about homelessness.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> requested help from the Army as fears mounted that three Japanese climbers trying to make a winter ascent of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> were near death somewhere near the summit. The Park Service on Tuesday said little can be done until hurricane-force winds buffeting the 20,320-foot peak abate. The climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are believed to have run out of food six days ago, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON>, a park service spokesman. The men have a radio but have made no contact, he said. The Army has Chinook helicopters specially equipped for high-altitude rescues, but they are not expected to be able to fly until Thursday or Friday because of the wind, <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON> said. An Army plane circled the mountain repeatedly on Monday, broadcasting messages, but received no response from the climbers, <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON> said park rangers believe the climbers could be holed up in a snow cave somewhere between 17,000 feet and the summit of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s highest peak. He said there is also concern that the men have run out of fuel needed to melt snow. Without water, they could quickly succumb to dehydration and hypothermia. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, because of its location near the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, is judged to be one of the most difficult winter climbs. `` Based on what they took, they're six days out of food,'' <PERSON> Quinley </PERSON> said. `` But the park service has a cache at 17,200, apparently fairly close to where they would be camped, and there's food and fuel there. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported sustained winds of 60 mph to 100 mph in the area. Climbing ranger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Seibert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION> estimated those winds reach 90 mph to 200 mph as they funnel through passes in the mountains. He identified the missing climbers as 39-year-old <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON>, the group leader, 31-year-old <PERSON> Teruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Saegusa </PERSON> and 34-year-old <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Komatsu </PERSON>, all of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 A smiling <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came home Tuesday from a month-long stay in an alcohol treatment program, escorted by her father and her husband. With his arm around her waist, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, `` Does n't she look terrific?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 52, entered the <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> treatment center in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Feb. 5 after developing a drinking problem that her husband blamed on exhaustion and the letdown following his failed presidential bid. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was driven home by her husband and her father, conductor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. On the way, she visited her 5-week-old granddaughter, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Emerging from a car outside her <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled broadly and waved to reporters and photographers. Asked what was the best part of being home, she said, `` Being with my husband.'' The governor added, `` Being with my wife.'' The governor and his wife quickly disappeared inside their home. `` We and our family are extremely grateful and deeply touched by the love and support she has received from so many people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement. The statement said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expects `` soon to resume a full and active schedule.'' She recently signed a book contract and launched a public speaking career. <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION>, a 160-bed facility founded in 1980, operates an intensive 28-day alcohol program that serves more than 1,000 patients a year.

 A south-to-north `` Freedom Caravan'' will leave <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in late June to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the slayings of three civil right workers in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, officials said today.

They had each been shot in the head. Although no one was ever tried for the murders, eight men were convicted on federal charges of denying the three their constitutional rights. The slayings and the aftermath were the subject of the movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' which received an Academy Award nomination. State Rep. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a black lawmaker and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference that the caravan from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> would be a symbol of a `` new foundation of human rights'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Orleans Symphony Shakes Off Debt And Serves Up Chopin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON> will raise the baton before a sold-out house Wednesday night in a concert that backers hope signals the end of years of debt and discord for the New Orleans Symphony. The symphony suspended operation a year ago, unable to pay its musicians and nearly $ 4 million in debt. It is reopening with the help of volunteers, corporate gifts, donated services and free rent for five years, its president said Tuesday. `` I'm elated,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who assumed the job of bailing out the orchestra in December. `` We have put together a wonderful staff that has been working 24 hours a day doing what everyone said could n't be done.'' The financial crisis had been building for years and was blamed on mismanagement before the symphony got a full-time manager in 1986. Public and corporate financial support eroded and the money problems led to a musicians walkout in 1987. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Coca-Cola Bottling, was picked to head the symphony board and engineer a comeback. `` It really got to people in this city when the symphony was dark. They realized what they were in danger of losing and decided to make sure it would n't happen,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> also helped the city during last summer's Republican National Convention. He took over a faltering private fund drive and helped raise the $ 5 million needed to pay <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' cost of serving as host. Donations of $ 225,000, earmarked for the symphony if it reopened, will pay off the remaining debts and leave the books in the black Thursday morning, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The symphony's home, the Orpheum Theater, is being completely restored and has been sold to seven investors, eliminating $ 2.4 million of the symphony's debts, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The investors, who have asked not to be identified, have agreed to let the symphony use the theater for free for five years. `` The work on the theater has been done by volunteers and contractors who have donated their services for the most part,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. In addition to eliminating the debt, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the symphony had two other goals _ selling out their first performance and 50 percent sales of the subscription tickets. `` Our opening concert has been sold out for over a week and our subscription sales are running at 80 percent,'' he said. <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>, music director of the symphony, will conduct a program of <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> in the reopening concert. It will be the third season for the son of the Russian composer <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>.

<HEAD>No More Frivolous National Security Claims, North Trial Judge Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, irritated by repeated interruptions of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial by claims that national security was about to be violated, warns lawyers in a blistering memo that he will no longer honor claims he considers frivolous. In an order late Monday dismissing a North contention that prosecutors were guilty of misconduct, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> blamed many of the problems in handling secret documents on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The North trial was in recess Tuesday because of snow and freezing rain. It has become clear, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in the written order, that many documents were classified only for purposes of the North trial, now in its fifth week, when they were not deemed secret before. Not that they all should be out in the open, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge added. `` It is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have been classified from the outset were not classified in any way, at certain agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>,'' he wrote. No effort was made to follow rules set down for classification and `` this has resulted in a haphazard process of review of nonclassified materials to determine what can now be released publicly,'' he said. Triggering the judge's ire was an instance last month while <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier to the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government, was being questioned. During questioning about letters <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had written to North, prosecutors used versions of the letters with some names and places censored. But it turned out that uncensored versions of the memos long ago had been turned over by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer to a private group, the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which was involved in a lawsuit, and that the prosecution had known about it for two weeks. The Institute made the uncut documents available to news organizations. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer said he had told prosecutors on Feb. 10 in the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> about the memos becoming public. Informed at the time were office security chief <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON>, prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON> and another attorney in the office. <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer to turn over the memos, but he refused and no one in <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office took any further action until the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> announced its intention to publicize the uncensored text. <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON> `` made only a half-hearted attempt to retrieve copies of the memoranda,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` He made no attempt to retrieve them from the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. ... He became uncertain and confused. His boss at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> was out of town and he simply did not act. ... He proved incompetent for the task assigned to him.'' <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>, too, was to blame, said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, for letting the matter slip his mind but `` he had no purpose to conceal or to mislead.'' The whole brouhaha, said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, illustrates a problem `` which continues to plague the course of the trial'' _ how to apply the law which governs handling of secret material in court. While an interagency group has worked on classifying and declassifying documents for trial, he said, it has at the same time created uncertainty about the status of many papers. `` It leads to the often absurd situation where the press is accurately reporting information in the public domain while the court is confronted with representations that the same facts must never be officially acknowledged,'' he said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> called attention to an appeals court decision in another case this year that district courts can ignore claims of classification that are frivolous. Should the occasion warrant, said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, he will do just that.

<HEAD>Bush Counters Commentaries That He's Moving Too Slowly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reports that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is off to a stumbling start are common in the nation's capital, but the president said they have n't reached <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> yet and he wo n't be upset until they do. `` A lot is happening,'' said the president Tuesday, obviously nettled by commentaries that very little appears to be going on in his administration. `` Not all of it good, but a lot is happening,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an impromptu White House news conference. At the top of the list of the not-so-good things happening for the new administration is the prolonged fight over the nomination of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense. But that was not all. Critics have also said the administration is moving very slowly in filling other posts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that was a bad rap and offered some numbers to make his case. He noted that eight years ago, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was forming his administration, `` at this juncture 55 names, as of March 6th, had been announced. On the Bush-Quayle administration, 67 have been announced. So it's not bad. We're a little bit ahead in terms of announced names.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House aide who now is editor at large of U.S. News and World Report, put the numbers in a different perspective in an article published last weekend in the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> said the president had nominated people for only two of 41 Pentagon slots that require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> used similar figures for other Cabinet departments _ two of 17 at <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, two of 20 at Energy and one of 18 at Interior. Perhaps more telling than the numbers was the perception that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not matching his own rhetoric. The day after his election victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I will, for the most part, bring in a brand new team of people from across the country that will reinvigorate the process.'' So far, the new team has a familiar look about it. To head the 14 Cabinet departments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck with three holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and chose three others who had held Cabinet-level jobs in the preceding eight years. Four appointments went to veteran <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hands who had served in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including Tower and former Reps. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. One outsider nominated was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, very much a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insider from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The other three outsiders were <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. Not an unfriendly critic of the president, <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> startled some Washingtonians with such observations as, `` There is a deepening sense in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that something is badly amiss in his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- administration. `` Some of his most ardent friends furrow their brows and quietly shake their heads. ... So far, despite some excellent appointments at the top, it -LRB- the administration -RRB- has put together only a shell of a government.'' <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> anticipated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention that all was well in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>. He noted that President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a Democrat, learned that when the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Beltway crowd turns against an administration `` those feelings ripple out and can eventually sink a president.'' The first shots often are aimed at the chief of staff, in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s case former Gov <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, a man who is described as bright and abrasive _ in roughly equal proportions. `` Every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets saluted for his brilliance, and a month later he gets attacked for his something else. And I have total confidence in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>,'' said the president. While it was a heartfelt endorsement, the fact that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt he had to express his confidence in his chief of staff was an early sign that the knives are out for the former governor. But it was a phone conversation with a supporter in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> that the president was most eager to talk about. The supporter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, had commented, `` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he learned from the call `` never -LRB- to -RRB- get all too up-tight about _ about stuff that has n't reached <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> yet, and be sure that there's some accomplishments going on,'' he said. That may prove true. But will it play in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>?

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a craggy, jut-jawed character actor who specialized in military roles, has died at the age of 77. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> died in his sleep Monday night at his home in the southern village of <ORGANIZATION> Salehurst </ORGANIZATION>, said his agent, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> made his stage debut at age 21 and had many Shakespearean roles, including <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> in `` Hamlet'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1936. He served as an artilleryman in World War II and made his first movie in 1952, opposite <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> in `` The Red Beret.'' He once said he was offered a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> contract in his younger days, but `` they wanted me to have my ears pinned back like <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and the gap filled in between my front teeth. I would n't have minded that, but then they said the name was too plain and would have to go, and a bit of chin. So I said no.'' Instead, he became a stalwart of postwar <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> cinema, most memorably as the tough warden of a British army prison opposite <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> in the 1965 film `` The Hill.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' towering physique and growling voice made him a natural for the part of a general in `` The Battle of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'' in 1969, but he also showed a comic flair as the campy older man in 1970's `` Entertaining Mr <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>.'' In 1985, he was in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> appearing in a play when he was asked to play a single-episode deathbed scene as <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>'s long-lost father in `` Dynasty. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> he had never been a TV watcher, and `` I was startled when the Americans in my play kept saying to me, ` Gosh, an episode of ` Dynasty.' What an accolade!''' Actress <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Syms </PERSON>, who starred with <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> in the 1958 war movie `` Ice Cold in <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>,'' remembered him as `` the gentle giant.'' `` He was a perfect gentleman and a lovely, soft-spoken man ... I ca n't think of anything nasty to say about him, except that he had bony knees.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> struggled to restore its Northeast shuttle Tuesday, throwing its strike-diminished work force into an intense battle with competitor <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> for the lucrative line. `` Fly Us With No Reservations,'' Eastern declared in full-page newspaper advertisements, pledging routine service between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Our No. 1 priority is to keep the shuttle flying.'' But ridership was low at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, moving aggressively to capture <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> regulars, reported strong shuttle business. Since the strike Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has doubled its rush-hour service, added a bigger airplane and aggressively promoted its frequent-flier program to shuttle passengers. `` We do n't look at this as extra capacity for a few days. We look at it as an opportunity to win long-term allegiance,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>. `` We are trying to take advantage of the special opportunity.'' `` It's fair,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling its shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. If the tables were turned, he said, `` We'd be doing the same thing.'' Eastern, which has operated its shuttle for 27 years, held just over half the business before the strike, for a profit of about $ 30 million last year. The rest _ roughly 5,000 passengers each weekday _ had been gradually wrested away by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> since it opened its shuttle in 1986. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> operated 60 percent of its shuttle flights Monday _ the others canceled by snow, not strikers _ and hoped to fly them all Tuesday, despite continued bad weather. Crews were mainly management employees. Patronage was low. A source at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it had been averaging 15 or 20 passengers per shuttle flight. <PERSON> Ronnet </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a New Yorker on the 9 a.m. shuttle from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said it carried just four passengers. `` A lot of people went over to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> just to avoid the hassle,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> conceded. `` But we're routine today and expect to be routine from here on out.'' The problem may not be <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s for long, with a pending $ 365 million sale to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Some Wall Street analysts suggested the strike, if it led to bankruptcy, could endanger the sale; others said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will be getting a somewhat tarnished property. `` The hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody to try your product,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, airline analyst at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage house <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> indeed is able to provide a good product, there's a good chance they'll be able to keep at least some of the additional traffic they've taken from Eastern.'' But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` not the least bit worried.'' `` I think when we start operating it's going to be big news,'' <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said. `` I think the Trump name is a very powerful name. We are not worried about whether we're starting from one market share or another market share.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> _ which has gone so far as to laminate shuttle travelers' business cards into free luggage tags at its terminals this week _ had another view `` This just gives us a golden opportunity to get those Eastern diehard passengers,'' said <PERSON> Perette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, shuttle marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hopefully they'll become loyalists to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle.''

 A bomb hidden in a car exploded during the Tuesday morning rush hour near the American University hospital in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing two women and wounding 21, police said. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> blamed the bomb on Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, charging its was part of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leader's efforts to neutralize the war-torn nation's private armies. `` I looked out of the window and saw fire blazing in several cars, a corpse in the middle of the street and people running in all directions,'' said a man who watched the blast form a nearby building. He refused to give his name. The fourth car bomb in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year was placed in a yellow <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> that exploded in front of a fruit and vegetable stall off the main <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> commercial thoroughfare. A woman maneuvering to park her car near the yellow <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> was killed when the bomb went off, a police spokesman said. The blast threw her body from the car. He said the second woman, a passer-by, suffered serious head wounds and died later in the hospital. The bomb triggered fires in nine cars parked near the stall and shattered windows in surrounding buildings. Panicking motorists caused several accidents as the tried to flee the scene, said a woman who identified herself only as a telephone operator from the nearby Cavalier Hotel. Ambulances were slowed by rush-hour traffic, the police spokesman said. Accountant <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamoud </PERSON> said he watched as `` gunmen fired their rifles in the air to make way for the ambulances.'' Ambulances evacuated only three of the wounded. `` Civilians carried most of the casualties on their backs to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hospital,'' a few hundred yards away, the police spokesman said. Most of those injured suffered minor cuts from glass shards, he said. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia is allied with the Syrians who police west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the bomb was a warning from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. `` Those who are trying to encircle us, today sent us a booby-trapped message,'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> claimed. He was referring to efforts by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s helicopter gunships and gunboats to prevent merchant ships from docking at illegal port facilities run by his and other militias along <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s coastline. The air-and-sea patrols started Monday, ignoring rocket fire by <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s militia based near <LOCATION> Jiye </LOCATION> port, south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s aim to choke off the main revenues of private armies has provoked objections from Syrian-backed Moslem leaders who consider it an attempt to restrict their operations. Moslems refuse to recognize <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s military Cabinet, appointed by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> in September after parliament failed to elect his successor. They pledge allegiance to the Moslem Cabinet of Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. By police count, 11 people were killed and 47 wounded in three January car bombings. Twenty car bombs exploded in 1988, killing 116 people and wounding 488.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Justices Plead for Budget Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a budget increase of $ 1.4 million to ease what one justice said is such a severe money pinch the court is having trouble paying for typewriter repairs. `` We're hurting,'' Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. `` We have a real strain on our budget. We ca n't keep our typewriters operating.'' The court is asking for $ 17.3 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an increase of a little more than $ 1.4 million over the current budget. Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, D-Mass., gave a mixed reception to <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, who also spoke in support of the budget request `` I'm really not that sympathetic,'' he said. `` We ca n't be all things to all people.'' But later Early expressed support and urged the justices to speak out more forcefully to attract attention to the court's plight. `` It's ludicrous to treat you the same way as anyone else,'' he said. `` We've got to spend more money.'' `` I do n't know waht you should be doing, all threatening to resign or something,'' Early said. Adding that the entire federal court system needs more money, he said, `` There's not one federal judge who could n't leave and increase his salary by 20 to 25 percent.'' Underscoring the point, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she knew of one former clerk to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice who recently left for private law practice and `` is earning more than the justices.'' The annual salary of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice is $ 110,000. Included in the court's budget request are $ 110,000 for library shelves and $ 160,000 to improve its computer system. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said 18 staff positions at the court have not been filled because of a hiring freeze imposed to meet budget restraints. `` Every -LRB- justice's -RRB- chambers and office of the court has been affected by the hiring freeze,'' she said. It `` is having a negative impact on the efficiency and morale of remaining employees who must take on extra work when positions become vacant.'' Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman, said, `` You should n't have to put up with it. We'll see what we can do.''

<HEAD>Actress Joins Campaign Targeting Pesticides</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> joined forces with a public interest group Tuesday in launching a nationwide campaign to focus attention on concerns about the health effects of pesticides on young children. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental group, recently gained widespread attention when it issued a report claiming the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> does not adequately take into account the relativley high consumption of fruits and vegetables by children when setting limits on cancer-causing pesticides. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has denied the allegations and said that children are not exposed to an unusual health risk because of the pesticides. Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> said she hoped the campaign would put pressure on the government to re-examine its methods of setting pesticide standards on fruits and vegetables and promote the shift to organic farming so that such pesticides could be eliminated. `` As parents, we care passionately about our children. We should n't have to worry about the safety of the food we feed them, especially fruits and vegetables that are essential to our children's health,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, who has three children. She is co-chair of `` Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits,'' which was formed to coordinate the campaign. Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> also agreed to take part in a television advertisement cautioning parents about the use of pesticides on fruits and their potential effects on children. The group has bought time on a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station for the ad and plans to distribute it elsewhere around the country as a public service announcement, said a spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asserted Tuesday that he is as committed to human rights as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had been, even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't publicly focus on the issue during his recent trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I think quiet discussion is a good approach to try to effect the human rights objectives that I feel very strongly about,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House news conference. The president defended his conduct in not making a big issue of an incident in which Chinese police prevented dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> from attending a barbecue in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week hosted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> had been on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s invitation list. `` The very invitation to that dissident that they thoroughly disapproved of shows our public commitment to it -LRB- human rights -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised human rights issues in each of his meetings with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and once invited a group of Soviet dissidents to meet with him in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. On a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1984, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> protested angrily when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities censored parts of his nationally televised address, including a portion dealing with religion. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to draw a parallel between his own presentation of human-rights concerns in meetings with foreign leaders and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach. `` You know, there's two schools of how you do the human rights agenda,'' he said. `` I think that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was correct when he raised the human rights agenda with the Soviets privately rather than beating his breast and doing it publicly.'' `` And I think the results have been rather penetrating, still a long way to go with the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. During his <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not raised the issues of human rights with Chinese leaders _ presumably including the key issue of human rights in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, scene of recent clashes between police and rioters seeking independence from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday imposed martial law in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> after three days of anti-Chinese rioting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday said that the press secretary's statement was true up the point that <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> spoke, but that he later raised the general issue in a private meeting with Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaopeng </PERSON>. `` It was raised by me personally,'' he said. On the subject of linking economic concessions to the Soviets to human-rights progress, including an easing of emigration restrictions on Soviet Jews, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` There's clearly got to be some linkage.'' `` When Soviets come out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which happened here not so long ago, give them credit for that. When you get some lightening up a little bit on the question of Soviet Jews or something of that nature, give some credit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholic church official says he expects `` points of difference'' to emerge between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and American bishops but no confrontation in an extraordinary meeting beginning Wednesday. `` There will be probably, in any free-flowing discussion, points of difference _ points of difference that will be discussed and faced,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. He did n't go into specifics, but there have been differences over the right of Catholics to dissent from church teaching to how much weight bishops' conferences should have. Thirty-five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prelates gathered Tuesday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on the eve of the four-day meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops originally had requested the meeting in 1986, when tensions with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> were high over its disciplining of several clergy members considered too permissive on such issues as ministering to homosexual groups and artificial birth control, which the church bans. As tensions eased in recent years, the bishops considered dropping the request. However, the pope wanted the meeting held, according to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. In his speeches to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>, the pontiff has expressed concern about people who disagree with church teaching and practice what <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials call `` cafeteria Catholicism'' _ obeying some doctrines and ignoring others. In this week's meetings, he and other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials are expected to encourage the bishops to be ardent proponents of church teaching in a secular society. Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, the West German who heads the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, will deliver a major address Wednesday that is expected to set the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s tone for the meeting. A <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> source described it as a `` thought-provoking'' talk. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials stress the meeting wo n't be confrontational. May said the bishops hoped to bring to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> a better understanding of the 52 million-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's been a lack of understanding on the part of some people -LRB- in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said in an interview Tuesday. `` Some of these men have not been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or not very much ... some of them have n't been as fully conversant with our ways of doing things in a cultural contest.'' He said he hoped for a `` deeper understanding of separation of church and state, a deeper understanding of the freedom of thought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... a deeper understanding of the democratic process that we're used to, which is not always the way things are done in the church.'' He added that the pope `` seems to have gotten a new vision'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from his trips there and meetings with American bishops last year. `` I think it -LRB- the meeting -RRB- will be significant in the life of the church,'' said May. `` It will probably build a stronger sense of unity between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the bishops, a better understanding and realization of how we're all try to do the same thing in different contexts.'' The pope has held extraordinary meetings with bishops from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, to discuss liberation theology, and bishops from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, where the church was split into conservative and liberal factions over issues such as celibacy and the role of women in the church.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister Tuesday and agreed to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May, where they will discuss prospects for a Bush-Gorbachev summit. His two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> took place the day after they outlined their governments' positions at a 35-nation conference on reducing conventional military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plane made a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> on the flight home. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resisted a Soviet overture to reopen negotiations in April or May on reducing long-range _ or strategic _ nuclear missiles. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to complete parallel reviews of its arms control policy and nuclear force structure before resuming the talks. Reopening the talks on long-range bombers, nuclear submarines and missiles will be discussed during the visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the first half of May, after the parallel studies are completed in April, he said. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after the meeting, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is not ready to set a date'' at this point for a summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The secretary criticized the Soviets about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and military aid to the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was `` posturing'' on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> visited recently, and had helped arm <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in a `` way out of proportions'' manner that threatens its Central American neighbors. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official traveling with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the Soviet offer to mediate the furor over British writer <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' interferes with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign to isolate <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem regime believes the novel blasphemes Islam and its patriarch, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, has ordered his followers to kill the author. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday because it did not condemn the book and prosecute <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Despite clear differences on those and other issues, the get-acquainted session between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> appeared to go well. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it was held `` in a very positive atmosphere, reflecting a determination to cooperate.'' As they parted at the residence of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grunwald </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` told me it was a very good beginning, and I would agree with that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> objected to the Soviet attempt in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to seek reductions in combat aircraft and naval forces and also eliminate short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons. He said the mandate for negotiations that begin Thursday excludes missiles and ships. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal for separate negotiations on the nuclear weapons with ranges of up to 300 miles conflicts with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to keep <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and triple their current range of about 70 miles. On Monday night, a senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official briefing reporters under rules of anonymity said the Soviets were looking for `` fissures'' in the Western alliance. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has proposed delaying the Lance modernization for two or three years. On the trip home, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> suggestions for conventional force reduction were `` remarkably close to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has called for sharp reductions in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers to Western levels, followed by additional cuts of 5-10 percent on both sides. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed a first-phase reduction of 15 percent by 1992 and 40 percent by 1995. U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range arms have been suspended for three months. In mid-February, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> postponed a resumption until the policy review was completed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> he suggested to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the talks resume in April or May but the secretary said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will need more time.'' On the plane, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> it was `` premature to lock in on a date now,'' with the review in process. He added to reporters: `` It is our strong desire to build on the progress that has been made to date.'' When the talks were suspended, negotiators had reached tentative agreement on several weapon ceilings but were having trouble on ways to guard against cheating.

<HEAD>Rare News Conference Reveals Soviet Reformers Began Work in 1983</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet reformers began planning their economic program two years before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in 1985, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Tuesday, and he implied they molded communist ideology to fit. `` We had to find theoretical foundations for all the actions that we wanted to pursue afterward,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. In a rare news conference that offered an unusual glimpse of the personality of a Soviet leader, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> also revealed he is a workaholic who loves to read, misses the smell of newly machined metal from the factory where he spent 20 years, and is frustrated at the slow pace of reform. `` We have to have a lot of patience to implement what we have decided, because the scale of the country is so vast,'' he told 33 women journalists gathered in ornate St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on the eve of International Women's Day. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said planning for perestroika _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and social reforms _ began two years before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was elected head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That would be in 1983, about the time former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> came to power. `` Even at that time, we had forces who understood that everything was not healthy in our economy,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. For the first two years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over in 1985, they worked on theory that would support their ideas, he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has rejected many long-standing Soviet principles in his effort to revive a sickly economy. He is trying to do away with a system in which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bureaucrats decide what is produced throughout the country, and trying to transform the word `` profit'' from the height of capitalist evil to a measurement of socialist success. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> also promised to reveal the long-secret Soviet defense budget in 12 to 18 months, after accountants have arranged it in a form comparable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, apparently for use in arms negotiations. As part of the plan to shift Soviet spending `` from swords to plowshares,'' defense factories that produce 60 percent military hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 50-50 ratio by 1991 and 40-60 by 1995, he said. For example, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Aviation Factory soon will produce pasta, he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, whose popularity soared in December when he was seen nightly on Soviet TV cmmiserating with Armenian earthquake victims, said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most upsetting part of his job. `` I like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state bodies are implemented in the level of real life,'' he said. That's why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the <ORGANIZATION> Ural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine-Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> where his career began, `` to feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured, the smell of real work,'' he said <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> blamed part of the country's problems on corrupt bureaucrats, and he made no promises of quick dividends from perestroika, saying 40 percent of factory equipment must be replaced. `` We have to make certain investments, we have to have know-how, and we have to have time for that,'' he said. The premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap. `` In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily. Now we sell 300 tons daily, and still we have lines for detergent.'' Then he quipped, `` I do n't believe the overall washing has increased all that much.'' He suggested that journalists created a self-fulfilling prophecy by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more. To eliminate shortages, he said, wages must stop rising faster than retail trade and productivity. In an unusual discussion of his personal life, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he answers his own phone in a 13-hour to 14-hour workday, and continues work at home. As a result, he misses the theater and concerts. The 59-year-old premier said his wife, <PERSON> Ludmila </PERSON>, is a mechanical engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose to director. He said she reads extensively on the countries they visit and works on behalf of orphans. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said his daughter is a law professor at the Academy of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and her husband also is a lawyer, in the customs office. They have two children, <PERSON> Ludmila </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON>, 6. In remarks appropriate to the women's holiday, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> promised to reduce the time women waste in food lines and to cut the female workforce in hard-labor jobs. Women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and this should expand under perestroika, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. `` Until now, administrative methods were more suited to a man with a loud voice,'' he said. `` Now we have to control the economy not with a shout but with an intellect, and that will allow women to have their say.''

 The strike by machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is viewed as pivotal for organized labor, which is eager to see how the government handles the dispute and the implications for workers' rights in the 1990s Ironically, the unions are looking for help to a railway labor law, which it once vigorously opposed. The law allows the president, if he chooses, to intervene. It also allows secondary boycotts in strikes involving railroads and airlines. Not since former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ushered in a new hard line against labor when he fired 11,000 federal air traffic controllers in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in a strike been greater than in the dispute at Eastern. Employers in the recession years of 1981 and 1982 did not hesitate to demand wage concessions from workers and get them. Automatic inflation-indexed, cost-of-living adjustments that were a fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many settlements in the'80s. Steel, auto and rubber workers counting on $ 15 to $ 21 hourly wages took wage cuts, as did meatpackers and airline workers paid half as much. Those who balked _ copper miners in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, meatpackers in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or pilots and machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> acquired it _ found themselves on the street, replaced by non-union workers often willing to work for half as much. The return of national economic prosperity after the recession did not reverse the trend. But through it all, two groups of union workers were able to preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to inflation: teachers and other state, county and municipal employees, and railroad workers. The first group did it through a recognition that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educational standards were falling, by using public sector collective bargaining laws enacted under President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services. Rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 National Railway Labor Act, a law governing labor relations in both railroads and airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through government intervention and maintain transportation vital to interstate commerce. Recent uses of the railway labor law have raised union hopes. The president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have broad powers under the railway labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions through Presidential Emergency Boards. They lack those powers in other sectors of the economy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the mechanism several times, blocking threatened railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for concessions. And although the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act forbids striking union members at one company from picketing another company, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at railroads and airlines. Unions are counting on that combination to defeat <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, its principal owner, whom <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> this week called the `` Typhoid Mary of union busters in the transportation industry.'' It was <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> who acquired <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and then declared bankruptcy two years later _ a move that allowed him to cancel all of the company's union contracts. Eventually all of the union workers were replaced. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later upheld <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s right to abrogate <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes, creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be followed by any company. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spearheaded legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 changing the law, but ever since then <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been at the top of the labor organization's enemies list. Bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debt-financed leveraged buyouts exemplified by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labor's legislative agenda. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> acknowledged the `` broad implications'' if Eastern succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by $ 4,000 a year and its ramp workers by $ 8,000 annually as demanded in the company's last offer before the strike Saturday. `` There are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management and certain circles in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who want to see his tactics succeed,'' he said Monday. `` This company is not in trouble because of the wages it pays _ labor costs at Eastern are lower than other airlines operating profitably and efficiently.'' `` This company is in trouble because it's in hock to the banks some $ 2.5 billion,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` The interest cost on that debt ... in excess of $ 800,000 a day ... is virtually equal to the amount this company is losing. `` This is not an atypical situation in American industry with the vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that have been saddled on otherwise good companies.''

<BYLINE>Soviet Pacific Ports Rebuff Attempts by Nuclear-Powered Ship to
Dock ^By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Soviet Far East ports and a nearby region have refused entry to a nuclear-powered Soviet merchant ship for fear it is radioactive, and a newspaper likened the vessel Tuesday to a `` homeless child.'' The 860-foot Sevmorput, launched only months ago, had been anchored off <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> for four days because the city council refused entry, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said. It said city officials decided March 2 not to let the ship dock until they receive additional information about its radiation safeguards. Officials of <LOCATION> Nakhodka </LOCATION> and the nearby <LOCATION> Magadan </LOCATION> region also refused port calls after tens of thousands of residents protested to a radio station, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government daily, reported on opposition to the Sevmorput on March 2. A report in a third newspaper Saturday said said a meltdown in a nuclear reactor on another Soviet ship was narrowly averted. The Sovietskaya Rossiya article indicated residents became fearful of the Sevmorput because they had not been given details about problems with it. Fractures appeared in the $ 260 million barge carrier soon after it began its maiden voyage Dec. 31 from the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> port of Kerch to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Experts rushed in to check whether radiation was released and found the ship clean, confirming its `` atomic heart'' was not damaged, the article said. It did not say how the damage occurred or precisely when the incident occurred. According to the newspaper, the ship has good safeguards and could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a huge icebreaker, but it added: `` A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public indignation.'' Public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion and fire April 26, 1986, at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. At least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed radioactivity that eventually spread around the world. Authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a region prone to earthquakes, and have canceled plans to expand other plants. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON> said the Sevmorput was like a `` sea monster,'' uneconomical because of its size. It said the ship would lose $ 19.3 million this year and $ 22.9 million in 1990. It described the vessel to an `` offended homeless child'' and said every day it is idle costs $ 88,525. On Saturday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said a reactor meltdown nearly occurred Nov. 11 on the icebreaker Rossiya while it was docked at the northern port of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. It said operator error was responsible.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., says the national debt has been reduced by about $ 750 million through sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commemorative coins and related programs but more must be done `` to get this terrible debt under control. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage, says a law earmarking profits from sales of commemorative coins to reduce the national debt has been `` a step in the right direction, but we need to take a lot of steps to pay off this debt,'' which now stands at about $ 2.7 trillion. `` We've got to earmark tax money or even have a surtax. I know some people wo n't like to hear that talk about a surtax, but we've got to get this terrible debt under control It's the biggest, most serious problem facing this country today,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said Monday. A law passed in 1982 authorizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint to sell gold and silver coins and use proceeds for debt retirement and other special purposes `` is my own small way of dealing with the problem,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said. According to the subcomittee, which <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> headed for a decade, profits from the sales are approaching $ 960 million. Of that, it said $ 742 million is money to reduce the debt and $ 214 million is for special programs _ support of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic athletes and restoration of the Statue of Liberty and <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The debt-reduction figure includes $ 409 million from profits on commemorative coins, $ 200 million from sales of gold and silver coins, $ 25 million last year from special collector coin sets and a projected profit of $ 108 million from the 1988 Olympic coin program. `` There was no coin program before I became chairman,'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> said. `` Now, we have this clicking on all cylinders. ... I just hope to God it does n't go down the drain.'' He said private marketers of coins and precious metals opposed the legislation when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first considered it, `` and they'll never give up, especially now that I'm gone. `` I do n't think there's all that much support for private enterprise to take over,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>, a dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in Silver Spring, Md. `` Personally, as both a dealer and a collector, I'm very happy with the way things are now,'' he said Tuesday. `` The government makes a profit. So do we. ... It's been a good for everyone involved.'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> left the coinage panel chairmanship this year to become chairman of the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulations and insurance.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it believes it knows where a young soldier was during an 11-day disappearance near the East German border, but it declined to elaborate. Electronics specialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had been missing from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> since Feb. 21, but returned voluntarily Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said he has been charged with being absent without leave and with violating military regulations by coming within a little more than a half-mile of the East German border. `` We have an idea where he was, but we have no additional information to release pending completion of the investigation surrounding the circumstances of his absense,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkham </PERSON>. In an interview from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's European Command headquarters in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinkham </PERSON> said it was `` routine procedure, not to reveal details about such an investigation until it is completed.'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, who worked in a military intelligence office in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, about 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, had in his possession a portable computer missing from his office when he returned. In addition, a military vehicle <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had signed out was found Feb. 23 abandoned undamaged near the town of <LOCATION> Obersuhl </LOCATION>, in the restricted zone along the East German border, prompting initial speculation that he may have defected. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> has been confined to a military detention center in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Theft charges also filed against <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> applied to the vehicle and other items, including the portable computer <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> took from the office where he worked, <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s disappearance baffled military officials, who said he had been a model soldier. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and was responsible for monitoring radar and other military signals.

 Protesters fighting a high-speed rail link between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> said Tuesday they had won major concessions from British Rail, including slower trains and tunnels over one-third of the route. The council of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Lewisham </LOCATION> said it obtained the information from a leaked copy of a British Rail document. The state-owned rail company declined to comment, saying it would publish its proposals Wednesday. <LOCATION> Lewisham </LOCATION> is campaigning with residents of southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> against plans to cut a new high-speed rail route through <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the countryside to the rail tunnel under the English Channel that will link <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The channel tunnel is to open in 1993. The <LOCATION> London-Folkestone </LOCATION> route is a hot political issue for Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. It is also a serious ecological issue that comes at a time when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> needs to demonstrate concern for the environment. Council spokesman <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that according to the document, 24.6 miles of the 68-mile route would run underground, and maximum rail speeds would be 140 mph instead of the previously suggested 180 mph.

 Riots over police brutality broke out Tuesday during the funeral of a man killed by police last week, witnesses said. Mourners, some of whom carried signs saying `` No to police brutality,'' attacked police trucks following the funeral, according to the witnesses. No injuries were reported. The violence spread quickly as rioters attacked government vehicles trapped in the traffic jam created by the protest, witnesses said. On Friday night, police shot and killed three people after a bus driver, fleeing a traffic police officer, ran over and killed an elderly man. Last month, a court sentenced to death a policemen for the 1987 shooting of two brothers. The court ruled the murder, which started rioting in which eight people died, was not justifiable.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Motorists angered by having to pay both bridge tolls and higher taxes are fighting back, dropping everything from cherry bombs to bras into toll baskets. A couple of the baskets have even been shot at. A year ago, <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> citizens voted to replace the city's many bridge and road tolls with a half-cent sales tax The tax has been in place since Jan. 1. The tolls go on. `` Either tax us or toll us, but not both together at the same time. We're being raped. Financially raped,'' said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, 38, whose weekly driving takes her over some of the four pay bridges spanning the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. City officials say residents got just what the voted for _ if they read the fine print. The tolls remain until state bridge bonds can be refinanced using the tax as a basis of repayment instead of the tolls. Officials say the refinancing could take six months. If the task is n't done by Dec. 31, the law says the tax will be repealed. The mayor has vowed the tolls will be gone by September. Many motorists do n't buy the vows and explanations. The 35-year-old toll machines are being hit by liquid soap, cherry bombs, razor blades and gum. Other items found include chicken dinner leftovers, marijuana, bras, shrimp, beer cans and women's underpants. `` We've got a real mess out there between now and September,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazlett </PERSON>, regional toll manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Motorists, he said, have even opened fire on toll machines. `` We had two of them shot just last week,'' he said. Toll collectors are n't faring much better. `` Drivers are throwing plums at them. One grabbed a collector's arm and then drove off, dragging her out of the booth Others throw their money on the ground. When you confront them, they say the collector did n't reach out far enough,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Belch </PERSON>, supervisor of the Matthews Bridge toll plaza. For a time, about 14 percent of those passing through the unmanned lanes were n't paying the tolls, which translated at one point to $ 115,000 in lost monthly toll revenue. Officials responded to that by hiring more off-duty <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> police to issue $ 52 tickets to those who do n't pay, and officials say that has helped. Mayor <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON> vowed last week, `` If I have to stand on the road and do it myself, those booths will come down in September.'' `` Trust me,'' he said. <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON>, who campaigned in 1987 on a plank of getting rid of the tolls, is being bombarded with satire. A local radio station started playing `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>,'' sung to the tune of `` <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON>.'' `` We voted you mayor of Jax. Remember it was tolls or tax. Just tell us the truth. Take those dern tolls down. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, please do n't let us down,'' the song goes The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION>, the local newspaper, runs a small daily item called `` ... and counting'' featuring the number of days that both the tax and tolls have been in effect. `` We call it double taxation and they call it co-collection,'' said attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, an opponent of the tax.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday there `` clearly has to be some linkage'' between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Soviets' behavior in Central America. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have long complained that the Soviets give military aid to the leftist Nicaraguan government that the administration-backed Contras are trying to oust. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have said they are hopeful the Soviets might change that approach, a change that might be encouraged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to deal in other areas such as trade and technology with economic benefit to the Soviets. The president said Tuesday in a news conference, `` The more help we can get towards that end by the Soviets, with pulling back their large amount of military support, the better it would be between relations. So there is linkage.'' He said of the Soviets that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` give them credit'' when `` something good happens,'' such as their military pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the easing of restrictions on Soviet Jews. `` I do n't know exactly how to help you in terms of how much linkage there is, but there's clearly got to be some linkage,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a reporter who questioned him on the Nicaraguan issue. He declined to give specifics, saying the matter is still under policy review by his young administration. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary estimates are that Soviet weapons deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year totaled $ 515 million, the highest total since 1980 when the Soviets first started aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had been expected to bring up the subject of U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the Central American peace effort during his talks this week with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, sources said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has indicated he might entertain the idea of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concessions to the Soviets in certain areas if they show what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government considers good faith in dealing with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday reiterated his support for keeping the Contras going with non-military aid while the Nicaraguan government is made to prove it will live up to democratization promises it makes in a peace agreement being worked out by the Central American presidents. ` I hope there is some understanding on the -LRB- Capitol -RRB- Hill that these people must not be left without humanitarian aid. ... We simply can not and I will not leave the Contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all,'' the president said. Asked about the possibility of military aid, which would have dim prospects in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We are talking ... about how best to move the process of democratization forward.'' He said he would look for `` clear statements'' on democratization in the agreement being worked out by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s four democracies. The document also would include disbanding the Contras. When <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> last week to consult with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a Contra aid package, he carried proposals that also would offer the Sandinistas economic incentives if they show what the administration considers progress in such areas as press and political freedoms.

Despite the split, the 123 countries at an international conference on the ozone layer agreed pressure is on scientists and industry to find safe alternatives before more damage is done to the fragile atmospheric shield. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the three-day conference that ended Tuesday sparked as much public discussion as any international environmental issue since the 1985 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are all in this together,'' he said. `` We're all going to have to find ways to collaborate in cleaning this mess up. It affects us all.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the conference host, said all countries, including financially strapped Third World nations, must do their part to save the ozone layer. `` It is not a case of some countries asking other countries to act,'' she said. `` It is a case of every country taking action ... No one can opt out.'' Chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in aerosol propellants, refrigerants, air conditioners, fast-food cartons and computer solvents. They are stable and non-toxic when released into the atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20 miles to the stratosphere, their chemical bonds are broken apart. Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, causing more skin cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems Related chemicals known as halons, used primarily in firefighting equipment, cause the same damage, but are 10 times as efficient at it. `` Even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer were banned tomorrow, ozone depletion would continue for more than a decade and it would take our planet something like 100 years to replenish the ozone already lost,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, an Oxford University-educated chemist. Chlorofluorocarbons also trap heat and warm global temperatures, a process known as the `` Greenhouse Effect,'' which already is thought to be responsible for climate changes. More than 1 million tons of the damaging substances are produced annually, mostly by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Several companies are working on substitutes, including the American chemical firm <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, which is the world's largest manufacturer of chlorofluorocarbons, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. Some are working together to complete toxicity tests and environmental assessments required by governments. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> says it has `` candidate alternatives'' for all major markets and hopes to market them by the mid-1990s. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> carmakers told him they plan to use substitutes in air-conditioning systems of their 1994 models. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have promised to try to ban those chemicals by 1999 _ surpassing the goals of the 1987 Montreal Protocol which requires they be halved by the turn of the century. The protocol has been ratified by 33 countries. Another 20 countries told the conference they will sign up, and 14 are thinking seriously about it, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Environment Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it will consent to an international prohibition on producing and using environmentally harmful chemicals, said Japanese Environment Agency Director General <PERSON> Masahisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>. `` If an agreement by each country regarding total abolishment can be reached by the end of this century, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will agree to it,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which have not signed the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION>, urged Western nations to create a new international fund to help them acquire technologies to replace the chemicals. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, long a defender of the environment, backed the Third World countries' call. `` While we simply must eliminate CFCs ... we must not do so by forcing developing nations to forego some of the benefits of industrialization which developed countries have enjoyed for so long,'' said the heir to the British throne.

 The city said Tuesday it is turning one of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s most ambitious building projects into a museum documenting his popularity, horrors of the Holocaust and other aspects of Nazism. The goal is to learn lessons from the past, said a city spokesman. Plans call for the museum to be located in a huge coliseum that was to have been an imperial congress hall. But the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> never finished the construction that began in 1937. `` We want to show how the Germans were actually fascinated by <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON>, a historian in charge of the project. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was at fault, but not the only one. Without the fascination of the Germans for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, all the violence could not have occurred,'' he said in an interview. More than 60 percent of Germans then thought they were better off under <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Nuremberg </ORGANIZATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> city council approved plans for the museum Saturday. Costs have not yet been worked out, <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> said, but he hoped they would include permanent displays and salaried staff. `` We hope to set up an institute supported by the federal government, <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state, and public donations, because this is not just the city's inheritance, it is national,'' the historian said. `` We want to eventually make the museum a full-time center of studies about the phenomena of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, a combination museum and research documentation center on those times.'' He envisoned history experts using the center `` to study and compare the results of totalitarian Nazi politics with other political systems.'' <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>, about 125 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state, was the site of the Nazi party's annual rallies. <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> chose <ORGANIZATION> Nuremberg </ORGANIZATION> because it was a traditional government conference site before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> took over, and `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> wanted to give the impression they had ties with tradition.'' To further cement that impression, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> commissioned his chief architect, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, to construct the coliseum and a stadium to hold 450,000 people at <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>. The large stone facade of the incomplete building is located on the outskirts of the city. The area was to be the site of columned structures, stadiums and parks, inspired by architecture in ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> wanted the complex to reflect the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' interest in architecture and to commemorate the Third Reich, which he boasted would survive a thousand years. It ended in ruins in 1945 after 12 years.

<HEAD>Armenian Refugees Protest at Government Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 70 Armenians who fled the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> because of ethnic violence massed in a government office Tuesday to demand a meeting with Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, a dissident said. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a dissident journalist who is half Armenian and half Russian, said the refugees wanted to talk to <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> about what they see as government attempts to force them to return to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. At least 141,000 Azerbaijanis have fled <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and 159,000 Armenians left <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, most of them since violence erupted in the region in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in November. The violence, sparked by a territorial dispute between Armenians and <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, has claimed 91 lives, the government says. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said the government has been all but forcing the Armenian refugees to return to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> by evicting them from hotels and not giving them permanent places to live or new jobs. The refugees fear they will become targets of the ethnic hatred if they return to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The government contends the refugees would be safe if they returned, and says it is trying to find new jobs and homes for those who wish to stay away. A group of the refugees showed up Friday at the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet Cabinet, to demand a meeting with <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said. An aide promised that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> would meet the refugees in a few days and try to help. On Monday, the refugees received word that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> had refused a meeting because the issue was resolved, so 70 of them returned to the office Tuesday to protest, and seven announced a hunger strike, according to the dissident. The predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian Armenians have been at odds since February 1988 in a dispute over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians, who make up the majority of the district's population, complained of discrimination under Azerbaijani control, and demanded annexation with the Armenian republic. They have staged huge demonstrations and strikes in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> on Tuesday confirmed its last major source of development loans has cut off aid because the nation has fallen more than six months behind in debt payments. One newspaper said the suspension in aid by the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> closes `` the circle of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s international financial isolation'' and accused President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of converting <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> into a `` leper in the world of international finance.'' The suspension follows similar actions by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, a year after <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> announced he would limit debt payments to 10 percent of his nation's exports A spokesman for the Economy and <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the validity of a copy of a telex published in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> newspaper from the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to the Peruvian government. The telex, dated March 1, said the international lending agency was suspending credit to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> because it was more than 180 days behind in debt payments, the maximum period allowed under the bank's regulations <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s foreign public and private debt totals $ 19 billion. A ministry spokesman said <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> was $ 70 million behind in payments. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who has accused the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> of being a `` tool'' of foreign banks, said Sunday his government had stopped paying the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> because the bank's programmed loans to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are less than what <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is scheduled to repay on its old debt He said his government's policy is to `` have a positive cash flow'' from the lending agency. Government sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the bank had rejected recent Peruvian requests for new development loans on the grounds that the projects presented for approval were hastily planned and did not meet technical requirements. Economy and Finance Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> denied the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s suspension had isolated <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> from international financial aid. `` The fact that there is no access for the moment to <ORGANIZATION> IDB </ORGANIZATION>'s resources does not mean that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is isolated from the international financial system,'' he said `` Our operations with the Andean Reserve Fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Andean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> and government agencies, among others, are normal.'' But reports of the suspension brought criticism from the news media and government opponents. `` The circle of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s international financial isolation has been closed,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Ornellas </PERSON>, one of the country's most respected journalists, wrote in Tuesday's edition of Expreso. He accused <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of being responsible for converting <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> into `` leper in the the world of international finance.'' When <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> took office in 1985, he imposed a ceiling on debt payments equal to 10 percent of the nation's export income. His defiant stand was praised by many politicians in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which as a region owes more than $ 400 billion to Western creditors. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> used the money to finance an economic recovery program, but <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> ran out of dollar reserves a year ago and the economy has entered its deepest recession of the century. Inflation reached a record 1,722 percent last year.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that he wants to find a way to prevent criminal use of semiautomatic assault guns but still `` do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.'' The president, a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he directed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, his nominee for drug policy coordinator, to look into what can be done about the proliferation of semiautomatics on city streets. Although he said previously that he opposed banning such weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that he assigned <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to `` work the problem,'' and told him: `` I'm not so rigid that if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he spoke to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> after the nominee was quoted as taking a position opposite the president in saying he would consider outlawing the weapons as a way to cut down on drug-related violence. The semiautomatic AK-47 guns have provoked increasing public outcry with an escalating number of shootings involving gangs and innocent bystanders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to find `` what can be worked out with finality on AK-47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman. I'd love to find an answer to that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has been active in opposing any semiautomatic-ban efforts on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on the grounds that such limits would also affect hunting rifles. Asked what he would tell family members of those who were killed and maimed by such weapons _ which inflict wounds doctors learned to treat in the Vietnam War _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I say the same thing I say to a person whose family has been maimed by a pistol or an explosive charge or whatever else it might be _ a fire _ this is bad, and we have to stop the scourge of drugs.'' But he added in terms of curbing semiautomatics, `` It is n't as easy as it seems to those who are understandably crying out, ` do something. Do something.''' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced concern about the terror waged by semiautomatics, his comments coupled with his association with the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> left gun-control activists skeptical. `` He has n't supported anything,'' such as a waiting period to buy such guns instead of the current over-the-counter purchase, said Stay Onders, public relations spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Ban Handguns. `` I think he got some backlash from his original statement,'' opposing a ban on semiautomatics, she added. `` I think he's just trying to make himself seem a little moderate.'' Efforts to outlaw semiautomatics have taken a higher profile since mid-January when a gunman took a Chinese-made AK-47 into a schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and shot 35 people, including five children who were fatally shot. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held his news conference on short notice after a winter storm caused postponement of a planned trip to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> that was to have focused on an anti-drug message. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience that `` the notion that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a nation at peace is only partly true, as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault our communities.'' He pledged to `` mobilize all our resources'' to combat drug abuse. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.5 billion for the battle against drugs, with much of the money going to law enforcement.

 Police on Tuesday detained more than 30 people protesting a crackdown on an earlier demonstration. Authorities called for punishment for journalists they said are trying to drive a wedge between ethnic Latvians and Russians. The developments were in line with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s growing intolerance toward a growing nationalist movement in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and its two neighboring republics on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. The Russian-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latvia </ORGANIZATION> published a directive of the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accusing the republic's state-run radio, television, newspapers and magazines of `` one-sidedness, bias, and jumping to conclusions that does not weaken but heats up the situation.'' It urged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organizations to punish party members in the media who ignored an order in January to cool the atmosphere. Anticipating the crackdown, <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> actors demonstrated Monday outside <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said 26 were detained. Hundreds of Latvians gathered Tuesday evening at the <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of the police, to protest the detentions, said one of the demonstrators, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that the demonstrators carried posters saying Monday's detentions were illegal Police moved in and ripped down one poster that called <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials `` Today's Stalins,'' said <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, a member of an independent political group called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said he and 33 other demonstrators were detained. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted a government official as defending Monday's detentions `` Interior Minstry officers have nothing against meetings and demonstrations, provided the organizers comply with the law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted Latvian Interior Minister <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrik </PERSON> as saying. But it said he added: `` This time, picketers' unsanctioned actions hampered public transport. They were asked to disperse, but some of the protesters started insulting militiamen.'' Most of the 26 detained Monday were freed without charges, but three will face administrative punishment, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The directive published in <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> did not give specific examples of biased reporting. But journalists and <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists said the party leadership was upset by news coverage that led to the adoption of limits on the immigration of non-Latvians into the small republic, and by reports that some of the immigrants were jumping queues for housing. The journalists also have covered protests on ethnic, environmental and other sensitive issues. The newspaper did not specify how the journalists would be punished. Of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are Latvians, and 33 percent are ethnic Russians. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, like the other Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, was absorbed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940, one year after a pact between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> consigned the area to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s sphere of influence. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON>, expressed alarm over rising tensions in the republic. He said the party itself was feeling the effects of `` ethnic stratification.'' Political ferment has increased markedly in the Baltic states with the liberalized atmosphere fostered by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Some residents now openly say they want to gain their homelands' lost independence.

<HEAD>1988 Receipts Likely Up Slightly from 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Higher prices for last year's drought-reduced vegetable harvests probably boosted growers' receipts slightly from the record level of $ 9.2 billion in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in 1988 because of declines in potato, dry bean and processing vegetable production,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in an outlook report. `` Assuming normal weather, output should rebound in 1989.'' While projecting higher overall income for vegetable farmers last year, the department's report _ a summary of another report, not yet released _ did not have a figure for projected 1988 income. The report released Tuesday also said that per capita use of vegetables, which probably declined in 1988 because of smaller production, is expected to return to pre-drought levels this year. `` Utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general economic conditions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` With real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong, domestic demand for all types of vegetables should continue robust.'' Exports of fresh vegetables, which soared in 1988, are expected to continue rising this year, reflecting the decline in the dollar and growth in the Japanese market, the report said. One reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry shipments to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries. Potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even higher than the department's initial forecast of $ 5.49 per hundredweight, the report said. Last year's average was $ 4.35 per 100 pounds. As a result, potato farmers are expected to expand their 1989 acreage.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to help appoint a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to negotiate peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman said Tuesday. Proposed delegates would be subject to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s approval, and the government would reject any Palestinian affiliated in any way with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. `` With the help of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and with good will, it will be possible to choose a -LRB- <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> -RRB- delegation which will be a temporary representational body until the beginning of autonomy,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal was made public as the issue of peace with Palestinians caused increasing splits in the coalition Cabinet of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Some <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers have proposed talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> under certain conditions.

But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejects both ideas, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said, confirming Tuesday newspaper reports. He said an interim autonomy plan granting Palestinians limited autonomy should be established before elections. Palestinians could then hold elections for an administrative council that would negotiate a long-term solution, he said. Speaking to a visiting <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> delegation, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> raised the possibility of elections Monday as a way to get around the impasse over the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terror organization bent on destroying the Jewish state. `` With these political figures elected in the territories, we will conduct negotiations concerning the interim period ... and following a period of time we shall reach a discussion of the permanent solution with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> representatives of the residents of the territories,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Tuesday. Meanwhile, Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of Labor said he supports negotiations with any Palestinian who agrees to give up terror and the claim that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugees have the right to return to abandoned homes in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within secure borders. A spokesman for <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> said Tuesday that once conditions were met `` the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is no longer the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as we know it today.'' Communications Minister <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacobi </PERSON>, also of Labor, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> could be a negotiating partner if he were elected by Palestinians in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Yaacobi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> added their voices to those of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>, both ministers without portfolio. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> described <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>'s proposal as `` jibberish'' at a news conference Tuesday where he restated his refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is our determination not to talk to this body -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- because they are opposed to peace with us,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Reported Planning Plebiscite to Amend Constitution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> plans to call a plebiscite in the next three months to propose changes in the military-drafted Constitution, a government official and a newspaper said Tuesday. Changes to be ratified by a popular vote in May or June may include one that allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to seek re-election in a December presidential vote, according to the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The newspaper quoted unidentifed government sources as saying <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is expected to announce the plebiscite Saturday as part of his annual state-of-the nation address. When asked at a news conference Saturday about reports of a second referendum, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said only, `` Everything is possible,'' and refused to elaborate. But <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s closest political allies, said Tuesday: `` I have firm indications that the president will announce a plebiscite to amend the constitution.'' In October, voters rejected a proposal to extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s term until 1997 and set the Dec. 14 election date. The Constitution bars Pinochet from running again. However, a number of right-wing groups have repeatedly asked that the Constitution be changed to allow the 73-year-old president and army commander to seek re-election. Last week, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> refused to rule out a new presidential candidacy. `` It's too early to talk about that,'' said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who has ruled since a bloody 1973 coup. The opposition has demanded constitutional changes since the campaign for the October referendum. However, the specific changes they want such as the elimination of one article that bars Marxist parties and another that appoints one-third of the 35-member senate, have been flatly rejected by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Consequently, opposition leaders have shown little enthusiasm for a second plebiscite. `` The only constitutional change we want is the one that restores popular sovereignty,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, who heads a moderate socialist party.

<HEAD>Flag's Use in Artwork: Desecration, Celebration, Cause for Reflection?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American flag is still on the floor at the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> despite a museum-goer's arrest, a lawsuit, threats of economic reprisals and protests from veterans, who vowed Tuesday to step up their opposition. `` I had 2,500 people here -LRB- Sunday -RRB- and I'm going to have 25,000 people here -LRB- protesting -RRB- next Sunday,'' said Republican state Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. School officials have n't been swayed by the furor over a student artwork featuring a flag spread on the ground. `` We feel.. that the First Amendment is at stake in a very big way here,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, vice president of the school of 1,700, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's most respected museums `` You almost have a charge from the public, if you're going to be a great institution to take a very serious look at freedom of expression,'' he said. The work that caused the uproar is `` What is the Proper Way to Display the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' by <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who calls himself `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The exhibit consists of the flag; a photographic montage on the wall with pictures of flag-draped caskets, South Koreans burning the flag and a `` <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> go home'' sign; and a ledger for comments on a shelf below the photos. Veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag as they go to the ledger, and on Saturday, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Willhofft </PERSON>, an art teacher from <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was charged with felony desecration of the flag for stepping on it. Protests began a week after the exhibit opened Feb. 17 for a five-week run. Veterans said they consider the flag's placement a desecration, and they were joined by several politicians, including <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> mayoral candidate <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>. `` I personally shed a lot of blood defending the flag. ... We defended it in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, we're going to defend it here in our city,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolling </PERSON>, who lost a leg in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and was among the throngs demonstrating Sunday. <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> urged a boycott of the school's corporate sponsors and also said they would try to cut off state funds from the institution. The school gets its money from federal, state and corporate sources, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, but she said she did not have exact figures. `` I'm getting phone calls from all over the country. People are asking what they can do,'' <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had no comment on the threat to cut off funds. The school closed the exhibit Feb. 25 after threats to students and the building, but it was reopened on Friday. The same day, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> dismissed a lawsuit from veterans seeking to take the flag off the floor. `` This exhibit is as much an invitation to think about the flag as ... to step on the flag,'' he said. Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Tuesday his group would abide by <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>' ruling. But he said the VFW would petition members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others to complain about the desecration. Ms. <PERSON> Willhofft </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, called her an `` innocent out-of-town tourist who was entrapped,'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has overturned three flag-desecration prosecutions since 1969 and is considering a 1984 flag-burning that occurred during the GOP National Convention. Another work at the school stirred controversy last spring when black aldermen stormed the halls to remove a painting of the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> that depicted the city's first black mayor wearing women's underwear. School officials have refused to disclose <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s whereabouts. The works in the exhibit were selected by faculty members.

<TEXT>
 A group of 57 political prisoners at a high-security prison have gone on a hunger strike to protest an alleged beating by soldiers and demand a government investigation, a lawyer said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ersan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansal </PERSON>, a defense lawyer, said the inmates told him they began the hunger strike March 1 after more than 100 special commando soldiers entered the cell blocks and kicked and beat prisoners. The lawyer said one inmate was hospitalized with broken ribs and that four others suffered concussions and were taken to the prison infirmary. <PERSON> Hilmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baykal </PERSON>, a prosecutor investigating the incident, confirmed the prisoners were on a hunger strike but declined to give any other details. Prison authorities also placed 19 inmates in isolation cells after the incident, the lawyer said. <PERSON> Sansal </PERSON> said fasting inmates want a fair investigation of the incident and the release of prisoners from isolation cells. The inmates are accused of belonging to leftist organizations that were active before the 1980 military takeover. They are being tried under accusations of trying to overthrow the government.

<TEXT>
 Private exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Feb. 27 for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The latest sale boosted to more than 7.8 million tons the amount of wheat sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1988-89 delivery under the EEP. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the latest sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 150,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 250,000 tons. The wheat was sold for shipment in April and May and will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 22.19 per ton, or about 60 cents a bushel, he said. Slightly more than 1.6 million tons are still available under the current authorization. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 400,000 tons would be about 14.7 million bushels and, at recent prices of about $ 4.1 l per bushel, would have a farm value of around $ 60 million

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday dismissed suggestions that the fight to salvage <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has paralyzed his administration. `` I think we're on track,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in answer to a host of recent stories depicting an administration in disarray and without momentum. He ticked off a number of initiatives, such as foreign policy talks with world leaders, saying, `` I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening.'' Several political figures, including some Republicans, have said they believe the long Tower confirmation battle has sapped <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> energy and held up other important business, such as key decisions about national defense strategy and the appointments of top-level government officials. But during a White House news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there were `` plenty of substantive things'' taking place in the seventh full week of his presidency. `` If you would just write down all those wonderful things I told you that are happening, and get it out to that wide readership,'' he told reporters, `` it would be very helpful to me.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to see the pace of nominations and appointments move more quickly, he cited statistics he said show more key nominations made at this juncture than were announced after six weeks by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, a White House communications director during the first two years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and now editor at large of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report, harshly criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an article written for the editorial section of Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` Win or lose on the Tower fight, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now stands perilously close to the edge of a cliff,'' <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> wrote. `` ... There is deepening sense in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that something is badly amiss in his administration.'' Asked about <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>'s criticism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well, I think he's wrong. Questioned about <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s statement that Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should seize the national policy initiative, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>? Enough said.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded, however, that `` that's one of the allegations _ disarray.'' But he said `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people make up their minds on perceptions,'' and he said he has `` total confidence'' in former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, White House chief of staff. `` Every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets saluted for his brilliance and, a month later, gets attacked for his something else,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended time-consuming reviews he has ordered in areas of foreign policy, strategic defense and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget management, saying `` it is a prudent thing to do.'' He acknowledged that not having a secretary of defense in place at the Pentagon was `` an inhibiting factor'' in getting the strategic review completed in 90 days, but said `` I hope there's not going to be any slippage'' in meeting the May 10 deadline. `` I do n't want to be foot-dragging. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> maintained he has provided <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with more details on his budget thinking than had either former presidents <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. He said moved quickly on the savings-and-loan crisis, that he is pushing ahead with a reassessment of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drug problem, with a host of environmental initiatives and with a system of national service for the young. `` Go back and look at history,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged reporters. `` It kind of goes in cycles. But I'm not deterred at all.''

 Israeli troops Tuesday shot and killed a Palestinian who ignored orders to halt. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said baton-wielding troops clubbed 25 people in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> clinic. The incidents occurred during widespread clashes between stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the occupied territories after the deaths of three Palestinians on Monday. In addition to the reported beatings Tuesday, at least 34 Palestinians were shot and wounded, most in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. Ten of the gunshot wounds were reported in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, where the medical clinic was raided. Army spokesmen confirmed the latest death and six of the injuries, adding other reports were being investigated. Also Tuesday, the army blew up the houses in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> of two Palestinians accused of killing a soldier last month. Paratrooper <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> died Feb. 24 when a building block was dropped on his head from the roof of a house. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio carried the sound of the explosions, and jeering and whistling by protesting Palestinians could be heard in the background. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said the two suspects confessed to the killing. In another development, Israeli newspapers reported Tuesday that the army detained five soldiers suspected of extoring tens of thousands of dollars from Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The reports said the soldiers allegedly held Palestinians at gunpoint while they frisked the men and searched their homes, taking tens of thousands of dollars, Israeli shekels and Jordanian dinars. The military command said it was checking the reports. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' market, 18-year-old <PERSON> Hakam </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was fatally shot in the neck and back by soldiers, hospital officials said. An army spokesman, who can not be identified by name under military rules, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> fled from an army patrol, ignoring orders to halt and warning shots fired in the air. He said the man had a record of anti-Israeli activities and was wanted on unspecified charges. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was the 391st Palestinian to be killed since the uprising against Israeli rule in the territories erupted in December 1987. Seventeen Israelis also have died, six of them soldiers. The fatal shooting occurred as the army conducted a major security sweep in the narrow, winding alleys of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' market, which has been a center of unrest. The city of 120,000 people, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest, was put under curfew, which restricts people to their homes. Troops with automatic rifles stood guard atop buildings along the main road into the city. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> doctor said soldiers and border police barged into a medical clinic run by the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in the Jabaliya refugee camp. <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> supervises aid programs for Palestinian refugees. The physician at the clinic, who identified himself only as Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone: `` We treated 45 cases of beatings, regular bullets, rubber bullets, and there were hundreds of relatives gathered in front of the clinic.'' Some of the relatives threw stones at soldiers, who chased Palestinians into the clinic, the doctor said. Inside, the soldiers beat 25 people with nightsticks and broke all the windows, a microscope, a telephone and some syringes, he said. `` They beat some of the injured people we were treating,'' Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said, adding three beating victims suffered factured skulls and were sent to a hospital. An army spokesman said more than 1,000 people had gathered outside the clinic in <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> and that preliminary reports indicated some Palestinians were wounded by soldiers. But he was unable to give a specific number or any details concerning the actions of the soldiers inside the clinic. A radio report said several people were arrested, including one <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> worker. Doctors at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said they treated 37 Palestinians for beating injuries, including some from <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>. Among the wounded was a 2-year-old girl who suffered a broken leg in a clash with soldiers. Among the deaths that spurred Tuesday's unrest was that of <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, 32, who died in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> prison after several days of intensive questioning. An autopsy conducted by the prison authority revealed that <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> died of natural causes and was not physically abused, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. The television said <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> had an ulcer condition and died in the corridor of the prison, not the interrogation room as had been alleged. Justice Minister <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that he had heard no claims of torture in the case, but the death was being investigated.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has made a preliminary determination that steel rails from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are being sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at less than fair-market value. In an investigation that began last September with a petition from <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry, the department found dumping of rails by <ORGANIZATION> Algoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and other unspecified companies in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> The department is expected to make a final ruling by May 22.

<HEAD>Massive Flare from Sun Disrupts Communications, May Affect Satellites</HEAD>

 Another high-intensity flare spewed from the sun Tuesday, but federal officials said it was not as massive as an eruption Monday that interfered with a radio navigation system and some communications. Forecaster <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> said the new flare was classed as an X-1, far weaker than the earlier one but `` still pretty significant.'' Solar flares are massive eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of the sun. The eruptions send waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles out into space. These waves can disrupt communications on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and trigger brilliant displays of the aurora, or polar lights. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said Monday's flare overpowered instruments aboard <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> satellites that are able to measure solar intensity only up to what is called X-12. Initially, experts estimated the flare at an X-20, but that has been revised. `` A more thorough review of the data came up with an estimate of about X-15,'' said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. `` That's still an exceptional flare'' and is the most powerful since April 1984. A powerful burst of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation, which crosses the 92 million miles between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the sun in just eight minutes, was detected about 9:05 a.m. EST Monday. It disrupted a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loran </ORGANIZATION> navigation system and some short wave radio communications, officials said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the Solar Max Satellite for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, officials reported that a stream of radiation from Monday's solar flare briefly overpowered the satellite instruments. `` The satellite -LRB- Solar Max -RRB- was stunned for about a minute and then recovered,'' said <PERSON> Carolynne </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> satellite focuses instruments on the sun to gather data for scientists. Monday's flare may have created a storm of geomagnetic energy that could impact the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> sometime late Tuesday or early Wednesday morning, said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. He said the storm is expected to be `` major to severe'' in the latitudes near both of the Earth's poles, and `` minor'' in the mid-latitudes. The storm could last for two to three days, <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` Major to severe'' geomagnetic storms can block some radio and navigation communications between aircraft and ground stations, and can interfere with some long distance telephone service by generating an electrical charge along cables. The areas of Earth apt to be most affected by the major to severe storm, he said, are those above 65 degrees latitude. This would include much of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, and the far northern parts of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. South of the equator, only <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is above 65 degrees. Geomagnetic storms also create spectacular natural light shows by energizing the Earth's magnetic fields over the north and south poles. This creates the aurora, known north of the equator as the Northern Lights. Radiation from solar flares also can affect orbiting satellites, but Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said there were no reports at Goddard of any instrument problems from solar radiation. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> monitors up to 21 satellites for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. Bursts of solar radiation can affect satellite orbits by causing the Earth's atmosphere to heat and expand slightly. This can put molecules of atmospheric gases into contact with satellites in low orbits and cause the craft to slow slightly and drop lower. More solar flares may occur at any time during the next 10 to 11 days, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> forecasters said. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said the solar flares erupted from a region on the sun that just rotated into view from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Monday. The area, marked by sun spots, will take about 11 more days to move across the face of solar sphere as the sun rotates. `` The probability of there being more solar flares is high,'' said <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>. The fact that two flares occurred in the sun spot region indicates that it is very active and apt to spawn more eruptions, he said. The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in intensity later this year or early in 1990. A flare occurs when energy stored by the sun's magnetic fields suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to geomagnetic radiation within a few minutes. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> said solar telescopes recorded the flare of as a tongue flamelike particles rising some 70,000 miles from the surface of the sun.

<HEAD>Budget-Caused Cutbacks Will Cost Eventually, Patrick Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday that budget-caused cutbacks in staff and computer equipment this year could cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 48 million in future revenues. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> needs additional funds in fiscal 1990 to hire more staff and buy more computers to relieve a backlog of license and telecommunications service applications that increased about 20 percent from 1988 to 1989. `` Delays in licensing caused by staff shortages or lack of automatiion affect not only applicants, but adversely impact the -LRB- gross national product -RRB- and reduce tax revenues,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice and state, the judiciary and related agencies. The subcommittee is considering the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>'s request for $ 109.8 million in funds for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal 1990. That would be an increase of $ 10.2 million over the fiscal 1989 appropriation of $ 99.6 million. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had sought $ 111.9 million. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s appropriation in fiscal 1988 was the same as fiscal 1989 and that the agency began fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1, 1988, with a $ 5 million deficit because of pay raises and health benefit increases. To cover that shortage, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he imposed a hiring freeze and did not replace workers who retired or quit. Other cuts included a 75 percent reduction in automated data processing equipment purchases, he said. He said his staff estimated that a one-year reduction of $ 5 million in its fiscal 1989 appropriation, if continued beyond fiscal 1990, could reduce the present value of federal tax revenues by roughly $ 53 million, producing a net revenue loss of about $ 48 million. Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, D-Mass., criticized the cutback in automated equipment purchases `` I do n't think that's good management,'' he told <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the agency had gotten to the point it could n't cut staff any further He said in the first quarter of fiscal 1988 the agency had a backlog of 10,322 applications for new services in the telephone industry. By the first quarter of fiscal 1989 the backlog had grown to 12,317 applications or a 19 percent increase. The backlog in radio applications was 20 percent, he said.

<TEXT>
 Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST. `` It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said. `` There was a festival atmosphere.'' `` It's kind of neat,'' said map maker <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayne </PERSON>, who was among dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar telescopes at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. As the moon passed between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and sun to cause the partial eclipse, those watching through <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION>'s telescopes could see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a burst of heat and radiation _ since 1984. `` There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said. The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a diagonal line stretching roughly from <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, northeast to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Views were best farther west and north. But because the eclipse was partial most people did n't notice the slight dimming of sunlight. `` You ca n't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a second-stage smog alert,'' joked one observer at <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION>. Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in downtown <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m. AST. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52 a.m., but the event was n't visible because of clouds that were so thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport. A slight dimming was noticed in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where partly cloudy skies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m. PST. The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse at other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. MST in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>; 46 percent at 11:09 a.m. MST in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; 36 percent at 11:10 a.m. MST in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; 35 percent at 9:58 a.m. PST in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>; 25 percent at 11:17 a.m. MST in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; 15 percent at 12:42 p.m. CST in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44 p.m. CST in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse, scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or filters. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRobert </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telescope magazine, said there were 245 known eye injuries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after an eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse. From any single spot on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, a partial eclipse occurs every several years, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbrecht </PERSON>, as assistant professor of astrophysics at <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION>. Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly once every four centuries, though they are visible about every two years from somewhere on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, he said. The next total eclipse will happen July 11, 1991, sweeping across <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, lower <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the west coast of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and finally <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> MacRobert </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the ratings for the 37th week in a row, but which network is second for the season depends on whose compilation of the Nielsen ratings you use. All three networks agree that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> tied for second place for the week ended March 5. But, with the season due to end April 23, the networks disagree on second place for the season-to-date. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s wins go back to last season. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was the unquestioned winner for the week ended March 5 with a 16.1 rating and a share of 26 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> listing. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> tied for the past week with 12.6 and a 20 share. Each ratings point represents 904,000 homes with television. The share is a percentage of the sets in use. The past week offered no surprises in the listings, with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' still in first place <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' was in eighth place after its move to Tuesday night between `` Who's the Boss? in seventh place, and `` Roseanne,'' in third place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which lists the beginning of the season as Sept. 19, put <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in second place after 24 weeks. Its season-to-date ratings are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.9 with a 21 percent share and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> 12.6 with a 20 share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads season-to-date with a rating of 16.0 and a 26 share. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, counting the season from Oct. 24, lists itself in second place with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share. It gives <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 12.8 and a 21 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> listings put <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in a tie with 12.8 each. It also counts the season from Oct. 24. The difference in the season beginning is due to the writers strike last summer, which caused a delay in the premieres of many series. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> set the season opening at the traditional start time because it had the Summer Olympics from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Differences may also result from interpretations by the networks of the raw data from <LOCATION> Nielsen </LOCATION>. It appeared that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> would finish in second place for the second year, but <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> became a contender with the miniseries `` Lonesome Dove.'' The Top 10 this past week was dominated by two nights, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday comedies and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday comedies All four <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Thursday shows were at the top, as were three <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> shows. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new comedy `` Coach,'' which had a special preview following `` Roseanne'' on Tuesday, placed 11th. But for its premiere in its regular Wednesday time slot the show dropped to 46th place. Here are the Top 10: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Who's the Boss?,'' CBS' `` 60 Minutes,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>. The CBS special movie `` Day One'' was 29th in the ratings. The premiere of the CBS series `` Hard Time on Planet Earth'' was in 65th place. `` Married ... With Children,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> comedy that came under attack last week from a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> mother who said the show was `` lewd and anti-family,'' was 54th. The lowest-rated show of the week was <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Beyond Tomorrow.''

<HEAD>GAO Backs Plan to Recover Costs from Estates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal and state governments could save as much as $ 500 million a year if efforts were made to recover some of the costs of nursing home care from the estates of Medicaid recipients and their spouses, a congressional report said Tuesday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> recommends that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> require states to establish asset-recovery programs similar to one run by the state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which recovers about $ 10 for every $ 1 spent on its Medicaid program. `` If implemented carefully, estate recovery programs can achieve savings, while treating the elderly equitably and humanely,'' the report said. However, `` it's a sensitive issue whenever you talk about someone's right to leave an inheritance,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Linz </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid issues for the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Linz </LOCATION> estimated total federal and state Medicaid savings at $ 400 million to $ 500 million if all states had an estate recovery program such as <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s. Medicaid is a more than $ 50 billion federal-state health assistance program for the poor. The federal government sets broad guidelines for the programs and provides the bulk of the money, but the states set eligibilty criteria and administer the programs. Most of the elderly who become eligible for Medicaid's nursing home benefit do so by `` spending down'' their assets to meet the income and asset limits for the program, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the program allows a Medicaid recipient to retain his home _ usually a person's primary asset _ as long as a family member is living there or the recipient expects to return to the home. Unless a state has an estate recovery program, however, it can not recover assets that remain at the time the recipient dies, or if their spouse is living, at the time the spouse dies, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Often, the only remaining asset is the recipient's home. Twenty-one states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have programs allowing recovery of Medicaid benefits from recipients estates, with annual recoveries totaling about $ 42 million, according to a June report by the inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. None of the programs approaches the effectiveness of the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> program, which recovers an average of $ 327 per Medicaid nursing home resident, which totals about $ 4 million annually, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The next highest recovery rates are $ 160 per Medicaid nursing home resident in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and $ 109 in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The key elements of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s program, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, are procedures for identifying a Medicaid applicant's assets, tracking and preserving assets while Medicaid assistance is provided, and recovering from the recipient's estate. The law also allows for recovery from the spouse's estate if the state did n't recover from the recipient's estate. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said advocacy groups for the elderly in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> say that the state's program incorporates enough flexibility so that estate recoveries do n't create undue hardships on the recipient's heirs.

 Twenty-five years after the slayings of three young men drew the nation's attention to the civil rights movement, a new Freedom Summer caravan is being planned to commemorate the deaths, organizers said Tuesday. Civil rights leaders from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and across the nation were joined by Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> at the announcement of the caravan, which will leave <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on June 21 and travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It will be kind of a prayer pilgrimage of reconcilation where the spirit of good will which <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has recaptured will come alive again,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>. Farmer, who played a major role in the original Freedom Summer demonstrations in 1964, said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> has shed its `` ugly image of hatred'' and can be a model for the rest of the nation. He said he realized that when he <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> greeted him in the governor's office once held by the late <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbo </PERSON>, a strident segregationist. `` I knew then that in this great land of ours, all things are possible,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> also spoke of change in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` Today, once more, the officials of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> are standing in the schoolhouse door, but this time we are standing in that door to open it wider and to make sure that everybody gets in,'' he said. The caravan will commemorate the slayings of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, whose bodies were found in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> six weeks after their deaths on June 21, 1964. <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was a 21-year-old black from <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 24, were white New Yorkers who were among the young people from around the nation who flocked to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to protest racial discrimination during Freedom Summer. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, the sister of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, said the caravan would `` recreate that moment in time in 1964 to educate the youth and re-educate those older of us who maybe have become complacent in our lives, and to re-dedicate ourselves to human rights, civil rights and voter registration.'' State Rep. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said the caravan would begin with rallies in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> and then head on to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Later stops are planned in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where a rally will be held on June 24 near where <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> is buried. <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> vanished after being arrested and jailed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on a traffic violation. No one was tried for murder, but eight men were convicted on federal charges of denying the three their civil rights. The incident was fictionalized in the Oscar-nominated movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' which has won critical acclaim but also has been widely accused of minimizing the role of black Mississippians.

 New Warsaw Pact proposals to eliminate short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> drew a split response on Tuesday, indicating <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could face a long battle over modernizing those weapons in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed deep cuts in troops and all kinds of weaponry, including combat aircraft and battlefield nuclear rockets. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also proposed new talks on the tactical nuclear weapons, which have a 300-mile range, preceded by moves to withdraw them from large parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Western officials said his proposals seemed aimed at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where there is increasing reluctance to go along with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> demands for immediate modernization of aging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battlefield nuclear rockets. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, did not mention <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal in his speech Tuesday to a 35-nation foreign ministers' conference that precedes the formal opening of the new talks Thursday. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also failed to mention the need to keep a nuclear deterrence in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> arsenal, ranged against what the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> says are far larger <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact land forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. By contrast, French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> termed nuclear weapons an `` irreplaceable'' deterrent. `` The maintenance of credible defenses, the modernization of this or that weapon is necessary,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> also said a nuclear deterrent is needed when he laid out <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s proposals on Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> held his first talks Tuesday with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, agreeing to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in early May to fix a possible summit and resumption of talks to reduce long-range nuclear missiles. Both men said later their meeting took place in a good atmosphere. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took issue with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposals for talks to eliminate battlefield nuclear missiles, noting that these were specifically excluded from the mandate for the new talks. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official suggested on Monday that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal was meant to see if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could open up fissures in the alliance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made its own appeal to West German opinion Monday by announcing it will explore ways for speeding the withdrawal of chemical weapons due out by 1992. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who has irritated the Americans by asking for a two-year delay on modernizing short-range nuclear missiles, hailed the move and on Tuesday urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to destroy its chemical arms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> lined up behind the alliance proposals for the new talks, but signaled he feels East and West should cooperate on disarmament. He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will act as joint hosts in June to a conference of military experts from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and neutral European nations to work on criteria for turning the military might massed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into purely defensive forces. After meeting <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> noted the differences between his proposals and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s, but added: `` Negotiation is negotiation. It is a complex process and I believe that in this process we will be able to find mutually acceptable decisions.'' West European newspaper commentators welcomed the new efforts to start dismantling military forces on the world's most heavily armed continent. The liberal British newspaper, the Guardian, suggested, however, that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was upstaged by the Soviets and questioned whether alliance nations had yet `` begun to leave behind the Cold War atmosphere.'' `` If the dynamism of the Soviet side is not recognized and _ critically but positively _ matched by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, that is a true failure of imagination,'' it said. The Belgian newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>, said it sees little common ground between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact positions and wondered whether the talks will fail as earlier negotiations to reduce tanks and troops in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> did. But other commentators and Western officials expressed optimism because of new Soviet willingness to disarm.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 on Tuesday to confirm career diplomat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, who will succeed retired Army Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, most recently served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. During his 30-year career as a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer he also has been ambassador to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. No opposition to the nomination was voiced during a brief debate on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, and senators of both parties hailed <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> as an experienced and talented diplomat. Several said that he begins his duties at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> with opportunities for breakthroughs in settling conflicts in many parts of the world. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> will confront anti-American, anti-Israeli and pro-Soviet attitudes from many <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members. `` He is wading into a real quagmire ... of anti-American and pro-communist bias,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. In the roll call, only Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, did not vote. No mention was made in the brief <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate of the controversy that developed when, during his service as ambassador to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> accepted a private document from a Central American official and delivered it to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The document _ apparently later delivered by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to leaders of the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ was an offer to provide $ 1 million in military equipment. During his confirmation hearing <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said that although he delivered the letter to <PERSON> North </PERSON>, he did not believe he had violated a congressional ban in effect at the time which barred direct or indirect aid to the Contras. He said he delivered the letter to North outside of normal <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> channels only because he knew <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's liaison with the Contras.

<TEXT>
 The government and the opposition have overcome barriers to a compromise, and an accord on political and social reforms should be signed April 3, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I am very satisfied,'' the founder of Solidarity said after an eight-hour meeting with the interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, and other government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. Opposition spokesmen said agreement was reached on legalizing the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, known by its initials <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, which had become a sticking point in the month-old `` round table'' negotiations. The news came on the eve of the anniversary of student riots March 8, 1968. On Tuesday, city officials in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> took the unusual step of issuing permits for two commemorative marches by students. `` We are finalizing the round table,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` All basic problems, like -LRB- union -RRB- pluralism ... will be achieved in time, in line with our commitments.'' Authorities proposed negotiations with the opposition, led by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s union, because of strikes in 1988 and fears of further social problems due to shortages, low wages and inflation running at an annual rate of about 60 percent. Among the goals <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other opposition leaders set were restoration of legal status to Solidarity, the independent farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the student association All were formed in the labor turmoil of 1980, when Solidarity became the first free union in the Soviet bloc. They were outlawed after martial law was imposed in December 1981 but have continued to function. Officials indicated soon after the talks began Feb. 6 that Solidarity and Rural Solidarity would be legalized, but the student group's fate remained in doubt. A joint communique carried by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> after Tuesday's meeting said `` there were conditions for a further rapprochement of stances on the key issues of dialogue and directions of proposed political, economic and social reforms, including the registration of the <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> student union.'' <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, a Solicarity spokesman, said: `` It seems that this is an unequivocal decision on registration of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>. This is good news for the students, but it's also good news for us because all the people taking part in the talks on our side have emphasized that registering <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> was one of the key problems.'' No other agreements were mentioned in the joint statement. It also said nothing of such issues as the form for parliamentary elections in which the opposition would participate and an opposition demand that wages be indexed to the cost of living. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> might have to meet again but the working groups on specific topics should finish by March 20. The period between then and April 3 would allow each side to study the tentative agreement, he said. About his meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who leads the government delegation, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` We are removing obstacles that have appeared here and there, but we are only removing them politically and the rest must be worked out at the tables because the experts are there.'' <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, national spokesman for Solidarity, said: `` I imagine the final agreement will be in the form of a resolution including general declarations, maybe accompanied by annexes with details, signed by all the participants at the round table.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to reporters outside the Roman Catholic episcopate in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after returning from the meeting accompanied by advisers. He boarded a train soon afterward for <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port where he works as a shipyard electrician and founded Solidarity during a strike in August 1980. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Walesa-Kiszczak </LOCATION> meeting included `` attempts to separate out subjects on which we can reach agreement in order to leave for the future subjects on which we have n't reached agreement.'' At a news conference, he listed requirements for an accord as `` working out a document about what links Poles, an agreement on non-confrontational elections and practical implementation of trade union pluralism.''

<HEAD>Subcommittee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved legislation Tuesday to impose a uniform closing time for polls across the 48 contiguous states. The elections subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure on a voice vote. Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash. and the subcommittee chairman, said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve the bill this year The measure, similar to ones twice approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, now goes to the full committee. Election officials in the West have complained that voters in their states sometimes decide not to vote when the winner of a presidential election is known before their polls close and that the drop in turnout has affected the outcome of close local races. Under the bill, polls would close simultaneously in the 48 contiguous states at 9 p.m. EST. In the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION>, daylight saving time would be extended for a maxiumum of two weeks in presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> are exempt from the legislation. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said the need for a uniform poll closing time became apparent after the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections when the television networks, using exit polling data, projected the winners before western polls closed. In 1988, however, the problem was different as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rolled up a `` large electoral college majority'' before western polls closed, said <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>. `` Had this legislation been in place, all of the polls would have been closed before a winner was known,'' said <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said that studies have shown voter turnout can drop by up to 2 percent when a winner in the presidential contest is known before the polls close. `` This can be a crucial in tight, local elections,'' said <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Major Deficit Reduction Would Mean Tax Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director on Tuesday that any major reduction in the federal deficit would require a tax increase. `` I do n't want to raise taxes, but I ca n't see how we can achieve a significant amount of deficit reduction on the spending side only,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said as his committee heard testimony from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> that there was little chance of enacting two administration tax-increasing proposals, broadening the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> tax to all state and local employees and blocking an automatic reduction in the airport excise tax. Those `` simply do not have the votes to pass,'' he said. The White House refuses to consider those levies as tax boosts. In response to questions by the committee, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he might consider other revenue-raising measures as something other than tax increases. For example, applying the telephone excise tax to wire services, now exempt, might be considered `` loophole closing,'' he said. Other changes might be considered user fees. But he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown no indication that he was softening his opposition to new taxes. `` If someone were going to change his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- mind, it would take a major effort,'' he said. At a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., complained to Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> that the administration was using rosy economic assumptions and other gimmicks to make its budget proposal fall within the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said the administration had n't offered a realistic plan that could serve as `` a starting point'' for serious negotiations and that the Gramm-Rudman targets might have to be relaxed even if a credible plan were advanced. He said it was doubtful that `` enough taxes and real budget cuts with real economic assumptions'' could be enacted to meet the Gramm-Rudman targets for fiscal 1990. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> defended the administration's economic assumptions as realistic and said that while Gramm-Rudman was imperfect, `` it is a form of sanity'' that has been reassuring to financial markets anxious to see progress toward deficit-reduction. Like <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he would oppose changing the Gramm-Rudman law and its $ 100 billion deficit limit for fiscal 1990. The administration claims it has met the target without increasing taxes. `` I feel very strongly that we should not move the goal lines,'' he said. `` ... I think we do have a starting point. I have optimism that we're going to reach the goal line without moving it.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan to resume discussions this week with congressional budget writers. The administration's goal is full-scale negotiations on the budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Congressional Democrats complained that the administration has been slow to provide information on policies it would favor in a deficit-reduction plan, especially the cuts required in domestic programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a news conference Tuesday, repeated his assertion that he has provided <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> with more detail than other presidents did at the beginning of their administrations. `` More detail has been sent to the hill at this time in our administration _ let me clarify that _ than at any time for either the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, 1981, or the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration in'77,'' he said. `` They had n't gone up with near this amount of detail to the hill.''

 <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> tried to put her past as an abused wife behind her by working at a women's shelter but always feared her ex-husband would return from prison to kill her. `` She said her choice at that time would be to run, change her identity and hope he would n't identify her, or stay and fight,'' said <PERSON> Michalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Elkhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>'s Shelter `` She was n't quite sure what was going to happen.'' On Saturday, her ex-husband, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, did return and bludgeoned the 29-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> to death outside her home with the butt of a shotgun, police said. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> had been freed hours earlier on an eight-hour furlough from an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> prison, where he was serving time for beating his wife and confining the couple's two children, authorities said. Within hours of the woman's death, <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> surrendered to police and was taken into custody. Murder charges were filed Tuesday. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>'s arrest `` did n't faze him in the least,'' said South Bend police Sgt. <PERSON> Norval </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` He had, you might say, completed a mission he set out to achieve,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` and now that he had done what he wanted to do he was ready turn himself in, and more or less ready to pay his dues.'' Protests mounted over the decision to grant <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> a furlough from the Correctional Industrial Complex near the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Reformatory at <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, and Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> over the weekend suspended the program. `` There are a lot of women who are very, very angry, and angry at the system,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mishawaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Status of Women. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> did everything she could to legally get into the system and get her husband locked up and the system failed,'' she said Tuesday after an emotional commission meeting. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> had become a counselor at the women's shelter in August and rose quickly into the $ 14,000-a-year job as program director, said Ms. <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>. `` We chose her mainly because she had been an abused woman and knew what it felt like,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>. `` She could look at them and say, ` Yeah, I was at the bottom of the pit, too, and I climbed out.''' In December, she asked for and received a volunteer appointment to the <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION> women's commission. `` That was her way of trying to get her life back together and possibly contributing, helping others,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. Two state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> employees were suspended without pay Monday for issuing the pass and failing to notify Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> that <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> had been granted the furlough, said department spokesman <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The government on Tuesday urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to remove its chemical weapons from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and destroy them. The appeal followed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to speed the removal of chemical weapons from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, in a news release, said the Soviets and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have a unique opportunity to make significant progress in ending the threat of chemical warfare. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken a step that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies should now follow without delay,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Referring to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, he said, `` I call on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in turn to pull out its chemical weapons stationed in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to destroy them.'' West German opposition leaders have said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal was vague and disappointing. On Monday, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to explore ways to accelerate the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to lead in dealing with this problem,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, but the early removal of the chemical weapons will require `` safe storage and the development of practical plans to destroy them.'' He also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has enormous stocks of such weapons threatening <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europeand </LOCATION> he urged Soviet leaders to join in the mutual destruction of `` these frightening weapons.'' In <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> will be the host of an international conference to halt the proliferation of chemical weapons. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for the latter half of the year but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> did not say how many countries might attend. A government spokesman said `` all the major players are expected.'' `` The momentum is there in terms of the will to get these horrifying weapons out of ... business once and for all,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. He said the conference initiative followed talks with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> about how to build on the momentum generated by the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> attended by 149 countries in January. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he was hopeful chemical weapons could be withdrawn from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ahead of a 1992 deadline agreed upon by both sides in 1986. He said he assumed that only technical matters had to be dealt with in securing the early removal of chemical weapons from West German soil. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehmke </PERSON>, a leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, questioned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan. He said the removal of aging chemical weapons meant nothing if they might someday be replaced by a new generation of binary chemical weapons. `` The only event to celebrate will be an agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the world-wide destruction of chemical weapons,'' <PERSON> Ehmke </PERSON> said. Binary chemical weapons use two chemicals that when combined produce a deadly gas. Government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to deploy the new binary chemical weapons if there should be a threat of war. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, in a television interview, said he would oppose replacing the aging weapons in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in an era of declining tensions. `` We will do everything in our power to ensure that these weapons disappear,'' he said. `` We do n't need them.''

<HEAD>Top Mushers Battle for Lead in Dog Sled Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, who won the last two Iditarod dog-sled races with <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> on her heels, chased <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> on Tuesday as the two winningest mushers in race history fought for the early lead in the 1,100-mile trek. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nenana </LOCATION> actually was farthest along the trail early Tuesday. But he had not yet taken his mandatory 24-hour rest stop, while <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, Butcher and five others declared theirs at <LOCATION> Rohn </LOCATION>, which is 266 miles from the start in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and 902 miles from the finish line in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, Butcher and <PERSON> DeeDee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonrowe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> were expected to start racing about noon AST Tuesday. Historically, Iditarod front-runners have faded badly by the time they reached <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, more than 1,100 miles from the start. In past years, <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, who has won the last three races, and <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, the only four-time winner, have been content to bide their time, making their moves much later in the race. But this year <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> and Butcher went straight to the front. He led Butcher into <PERSON> Rohn </PERSON> by 13 minutes. `` It just worked out that way,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said of their quick start. `` The thing is there was no one else that was going to go.'' The two intense, outspoken competitors used to be neighbors in <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> has moved to Two Rivers. Their rivalry has grown to epic proportions throughout the state. `` I think I can beat her ... but she's got a good team, and she might beat us all,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said. He said his team this year is better than the one that was runner-up to Butcher last year.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be given more time to organize his administration and put together his policies and programs, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said he was pleased and surprised to hear that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a news conference earlier in the day, had cited `` a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>'' as `` an objective spokesman'' on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. When asked at the outset of the news conference about commentaries that his administration is in disarray in part because of the protracted fight with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` My response is that it's not adrift and there is n't malaise.'' `` And I talked to a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the other day, which is the best phone call I've made,'' the president said. `` And he said all the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who is involved in the oil and gas industry, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called Sunday. `` He's only had 45 days,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said Tuesday, saying he has known <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since 1951 and came to know him better during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ill-fated 1964 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign against Democrat <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> `` All they do is criticize him,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. `` But he's upbeat.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official on Tuesday called for a month of peace in the war-torn south to enable the transport of 100,000 tons of food and medicine to about 2 million people facing starvation this summer. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund and personal representative of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, said the international community was in a race against time to position and distribute the supplies in the south before the rainy season starts in May. The operation will cost an estimated $ 20 million for food that has not yet arrived in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, $ 48 million for transportation and about $ 12 million for other expenses in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, executive director for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. He said this amount does not include the worth of the bulk of the food already in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, nor money for medication or immunization programs or vital structures like digging wells. `` This is a race against time _ a race to avoid the repetition of the disaster which happened when the rains blocked the transportation of foodstuff,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. He said more than 250,000 people died last year when food was blocked, up to one-half of them children. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said 2.25 million southerners in government - and rebel-held areas needed food and medication in varying degrees this summer and that 100,000 people could die if the operation failed He spoke on the eve of a U.N.-organized conference in which Western donor governments, non-governmental relief agencies and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> governments are participating to organize the ambitious rescue operation. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is not representated. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> described the operation as `` very very daunting'' and stressed there was an `` absolute need'' for a month of peace. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said he had indications the rebels might agree to such a proposal. `` We are in some consultation with them. I believe the prospects of developing a month of tranquillity is something which can emerge in the next few day,'' he said. Sources close to the conference said the donors, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would strongly pressure the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government to enter peace talks with the rebels. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> urged Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government to talk peace. The Sudanese government and the rebels both have used food as a weapon in the 6-year-old war in the south. Western relief officials estimate that in 1988 alone, about 560,000 southerners died of starvation or while fleeing the war. The rainy season starts in May and lasts until the end of September. It turns roads into swamps and makes airstrips unusable. Referring to previous international efforts to bring relief to the south, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said they were `` far too short to carry people through, once the rains start in the spring.'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said that starting Wednesday, a six-week program would begin to transport 3,000 tons of food and supplies to the south in <LOCATION> Hercules </LOCATION> C-130s.

 <PERSON> Roger-Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, a longtime friend of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, died Tuesday in a hospital three weeks after he was charged in an insider trading scandal that has embarrassed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Socialist government. He was 70. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> was admitted to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Neuilly </LOCATION> on Feb. 27 suffering a pulmonary embolism and died of a heart attack Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with hospital policy. The French news agency Agence France-Presse said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> went to the hospital after hearing of <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> met in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1940 and later fought together in the French Resistance. Over national television on Feb. 12, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> as a man of courage and integrity, but said if <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> were found guilty of an offense, `` then in my role as president I would not be able to maintain the same kind of friendship I have had with him for so long.'' Four days later, <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> was charged with receiving insider information that allowed him to buy shares of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shortly before the French state-owned aluminum manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Picheney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> offered a much higher price last year in a successful takeover. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> and his family sold their shares after the price soared, making a profit of about $ 350,000. Five others also were charged by an investigating magsitrate with receiving insider information or with insider trading. Either charge carries the same maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount of illegal profits.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Wednesday to abolish its death penalty and allow its 200 prisoners on death row to live, saying many may not have had a fair trial. The London-based human rights group, which opposes the death penalty unconditionally, said many of the prisoners are poor and illiterate and were not well represented in court. Some have been convicted by a single witness's testimony and have difficulties making appeals, it said in its 85-page report. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s death row population is one of the highest per capita in the world. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> island nation has about 2.3 million people. The death penalty, which was halted for four years ending in 1981, is mandatory for murder in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, said Amnesty. It said authorities hanged 59 people between August 1980 and February 1988. Amnesty's report covered conditions from 1984 to 1988. It said nearly half of those sentenced to death have spent more than five years on death row, and some have been there for 12 years. They are kept in the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> outside the capital <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, where they live in unsanitary conditions, without opportunities to exercise or work, the report said.

<HEAD>Administration Still Weighing Third World Debt Moves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has completed a review of Third World debt strategy but is still deciding what approaches to take to the problem, officials said Tuesday. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> refused to answer specific questions about a published report detailing elements of the plan the administration has under review. He told reporters after congressional testimony on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget that questions about Third World debt would be answered at an upcoming hearing. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had completed its review and officials were examining possible changes but that no final decisions had been made. <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said he could not comment on a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> story which said the administration's plan would put heavy emphasis on encouraging banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt owed to them by developing nations. The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that the plan under consideration by the administration would emphasize reducing the size of outstanding debt and would tap the resources of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to make it more attractive for banks to forgive a portion of their loans. In a speech last week, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> termed Third World debt `` perhaps the most difficult'' of the major issues facing the new administration. `` Unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loan industry crisis, this is not a problem that we in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> have the power or the resources to solve by ourselves,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The new administration is receiving pressure from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to go beyond the `` <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan,'' formulated by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in 1985 when he was <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Under the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, the international banking community was to provide about $ 30 billion in new loans to Third World debtors who agreed to make economic reforms. However, the amount of new bank lending fell far short of the goals and as a result there has been growing pressure for a new approach that would reduce the debt burden. That pressue intensified last week after riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> which were touched off after the newly elected government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced austerity measures as part of an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to get more loans for the debt-strapped country. In another development Tuesday, the Twentieth Century Fund released a report calling for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to support major new initiatives to resolve the debt crisis. `` The long shadow cast by the debt crisis covers far more than the economies of the debtor countries,'' the report concluded. `` It threatens democratic institutions in debtor countries, strains North-South relations and poses serious political risks for creditors as well as debtors.'' The report, prepared by a 12-member task force of business leaders, politicians and academics, recommended extention and flexible rescheduling of existing interest payments as ways of reducing the $ 1.3 trillion debt burden carried by the Third World. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimann </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> and the head of the task force, said he hoped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would go further than the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan in addressing the debt problem. `` The administration seems to be taking a very pragmatic point of view and I hope that is evidenced in their set of recommendations,'' he said. The Twentieth Century Fund is a non-partisan research group which has conducted a two-year study of Third World debt.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost members and may suffer more defections as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> approaches multiple-party politics, party officials said Tuesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the new constitution to be enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will guarantee independent parties the right to exist, but the first open elections under the charter will not be held until 1995. Party officials also are preparing to sponsor an <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, Socialist and Communist parties to discuss the concept of a `` common <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, secretary for ideology, told reporters after a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting about 3,000 members left the party during the recent debate over the 1956 Hungarian revolt. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a reformer and member of the ruling Politburo, caused controversy by saying the revolt, crushed by the Soviets, was a popular uprising, not a counterrevolution as in the official version. He based his assessment on a report of a party committee reviewing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s postwar history. A subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session issued a statement saying the revolt began as a popular uprising but became a counterrevolution. Tuesday's meeting adopted a manifesto that appears designed to inform and reassure rank-and-file party members who have become confused about widely publicized political and economic reforms at a time of inflation, declining living standards and a rising deficit. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reform was the only course for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` We -LRB- Communists -RRB- have no other alternative because, during the elections, the nation will decide in favor of the party of consistent reforms in their own interests,'' he declared. He said the party's membership might continue to decline but it would gain new meaning for the public by professing the values of freedom, justice and solidarity. `` We should expect that the ... competition of the various political movements will impose an encouraging or even compelling force on us,'' he said of alternative parties and groups organized in recent months. Many of those hope to win seats in Parliament when the multiple-party system becomes reality. <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Kileni </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told journalists the new constitution, to be submitted to a referendum next year, will not mean open politics immediately and that the transition `` could last several years.'' He said the first parliamentary elections based on the new charter would be in 1995, but a multiple-party system would be established before that. Trade unions, interest groups and possibly others will be allowed to enter candidate in next year's elections but the rules have not been determined, he said. Party spokesman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said the conference on a `` common <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' should be held in early summer and that 22 parties from East and West would be represented, including the Liberals and <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said only parties from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> would attend from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

They came down the street, opened up on the garage and brutally did to death these men.'' <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, the local representative for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the province's largest Roman Catholic party, called the killings `` a foul and brutal act.'' Police said the car used by the killers was stolen about 15 minutes before the shootings by two armed men a few miles away in the Catholic stronghold of <LOCATION> Ballinderry </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ardboe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility last month for killing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, a town councilor in the area for <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, taking emergency action in an attempt to curb drug-related violence in the nation's capital, voted Tuesday to require that people who use guns when they commit a crime in the city must be sentenced to five years in prison. It approved a bill also aimed at improving the city's before-trial detention program by allowing judges to refuse to permit bond for people accused of violent crimes even if they have no criminal record `` This is an emergency bill, and requires a lot of debate, but these are emergency times,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathanson </PERSON>, a member of the council. `` The people of this city are telling us we have to do something.'' The emergency measure, which will remain in effect for 90 days before being reviewed, came as the city sought to slow the pace of drug-related killings. Police blame about 60 percent of last year's record 372 killings on drugs So far this year, 98 people have been slain in the district, 43 more than during the matching period in 1988. The legislation also attempts to stem a flow of illegally purchased weapons into the nation's capital. According to police statistics, 3,863 weapons were seized on city streets during 1988, compared with 2,225 the year before. The bill survived a challenge from several council members who complained that it would clog the city's already overcrowded court and prison systems, and objections from others who said it needed more debate. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> proposed the measure almost two weeks ago, saying the city should start `` an all-out assault on weapons.'' Since then, city, police and court officials have twice met to discuss the bill. The emergency measure strengthens the city's handgun law, already considered one of the toughest in the nation. The old law set maximum punishment at one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for anyone caught with unregistered weapons.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imposed martial law on the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> after three days of bloody riots protesting Chinese rule, and an American traveler said thousands of soldiers flooded the city early Wednesday. Tibetan mobs had ransacked Chinese-owned stores and burned their contents, stoned government buildings and attacked Chinese in demonstrations for independence and an end to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rule in the remote mountain area. Official accounts said at least 12 people were killed and more than 100 wounded. Unofficial reports had up to 75 people killed and 300 injured. Police imposed a temporary curfew and cleared the streets Tuesday afternoon, threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square or in the Tibetan section nearby, the traveler said by telephone from <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. At midnight, jeeps carrying loudspeakers sped through the city ordering residents to stay inside and informing them martial law had begun, he said. It was the first time since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that martial law had been publicly announced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> later entered <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the American reported. `` Soldiers were patrolling in the streets,'' said a report by <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency, quoting Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaosong </PERSON>, political commissar of the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> regional military command. `` There's a lot of sirens going and a lot of troop movement outside,'' said the American, who spoke on condition of not being identified for fear of police reprisals. He said he was speaking from a hotel in the center of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and had stopped looking out the window after a soldier came to the window and blocked his view. `` Now I'm here with a blanket over my head in the office hoping that no one will notice,'' he said, speaking in a muffled voice so as not to attract attention. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the whole city and parts of two adjoining counties would be `` cordoned off'' and `` all meetings, parades, strikes, petitions and any other gathering are banned.'' The order also gave security forces vast powers to stop vehicles and pedestrians in the city of 70,000 people No foreigners were allowed to enter <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> without permission, and those in the area without permission were required to leave, the order said. The American, who said he had not been informed of the rule, estimated there were about 80 foreigners in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The nationally televised nightly news announced martial law Tuesday evening, saying the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> city government had been authorized to take `` any measures necessary to restore order.'' `` Any person who defies martial law or who instigates others to do so will be severely punished,'' said the order, approved by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet and signed by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said martial law had been imposed because `` separatists have been constantly causing disturbances in the city over the past few days.'' In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Chinese delegate <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuomin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> the riots were triggered by `` a few separatists -LRB- who -RRB- do not wish to see progress and better living standards in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'' and by terrorists sent from outside. He said the violence `` endangered the security and sovereignty of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' and forced authorities to take `` corresponding measures.'' On Sunday and Monday, clashes between police and Tibetans left 11 Tibetans and one Chinese policeman dead, along with 100 wounded, official reports said. On Tuesday, Westerners quoted Tibetans as saying as many as 75 died and 300 were wounded _ including an instance in which <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> militia burst into homes and killed at least five people. Two groups of about 100 Tibetans marched Tuesday near the main square and on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, the main thoroughfare. Police then cleared the streets, the American said. Sounds of gunfire crackled in the afternoon. `` All the Tibetans just disappeared, everybody just evaporated,'' said the American, who was given shelter in a Tibetan house. But by nightfall, Tibetans began to venture outside again and a bonfire blazed on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> after Tibetans ransacked and burned another Chinese store. Martial law was not imposed in outbreaks of pro-independence violence in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> in the past 18 months that left scores dead and hundreds hurt. The government last imposed martial law during the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution in 1966-76 when bands of Red Guards fought armed battles on the streets of dozens of cities. A form of martial law was declared on all of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> on March 23, 1959, after an aborted uprising against Chinese rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the 13th century. Many Tibetans say <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> should be independent and led by the traditional <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled in exile during the aborted uprising in 1959. On Monday, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> appealed to world leaders to persuade the Chinese to find a peaceful solution to the protests. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> has proposed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> grant <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> autonomy in its internal affairs in exchange for the stationing of Chinese troops on Tibetan soil and the management of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign relations by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has rejected the proposal but is considering the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s proposal of negotiations. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s administration said Tuesday it was not surprised by the imposition of martial law. `` For all practical purposes <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> was already under martial law. The Chinese have only formalized it,'' said <PERSON> Tashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongdi </PERSON>, the Tibetan leader's chief representative in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, when contacted by telephone.

<TEXT>
 This city took some of the wind out of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>'s perennial bluster of being <LOCATION> Everytown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the people of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think he's doing a fine job. When reporters questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday about criticism that his administration was adrift, he replied: `` I talked to a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the other day which was the best phone call I've made. And he said, ` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.''' So what do Lubbockites really think about that Texan in the White House? `` I really have n't been paying that much attention,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, a convenience store clerk. `` They're -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- giving him a hard time about -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- Tower, but I say stick with it,'' said retiree <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Berns </PERSON>. `` He knows what he's doing.'' While the majority of people questioned about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a reporter outside the post office approved of his leadership thus far, most would n't give their names. `` He's a Texan and he understands us,'' said one man. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Malouf </PERSON>, who wrote a letter to the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> Avalanche-Journal last week, defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and blasted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for its handling of Tower's confirmation as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary: `` I would rather be ruled by the first 100 names in the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> phone book than these clowns who now reign in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' In choosing <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON> as his example of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked an easy sell. This city on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> has a population of 186,400 and more than 150 churches, many of them large and conservative. Residents of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket 69 percent of the vote in November. Here, the agrigulture-based economy rises or falls on the strength of the annual cotton crop. Two consecutive strong harvests gave this city the lowest unemployment rate in the state at 5.2 percent. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> is also the home of one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s dearest friends, independent oil investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, who was the caller <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was referring to when he said <PERSON> Lubbockites </PERSON> were behind him. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said Tuesday he was surprised and pleased to hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> citing him as `` an objective spokesman'' on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. The two had spoken on Sunday. `` He's only had 45 days,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said, saying he has known <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since 1951 and got to know him better during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1964 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign against Democrat <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON>. `` All they do is criticize him,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. `` But he's upbeat. You will not find <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he's down. He just called, we talked back and forth, like friends do. I just feel like they ought to give him a year to 18 months to get things done.'' <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> Mayor B.C. `` Peck'' <PERSON> McMinn </PERSON> said people here are `` pretty representative of how the run-of-the-mill people feel across the country. Not the political hype or anything, but the rock-solid thinkers are pretty representative of how the situation is going.''

<HEAD>Sullivan Sees No Reason to Change Catastrophic Care Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that he sees no reason to change the new catastrophic care program financed by a surtax on elderly Americans. `` We're aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed -LRB- about the financing provision -RRB- but ... we are also concerned about the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out financially by the tremendous costs of illness,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` We feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we do n't have much experience with it yet. We'd like to follow this and see if adjustments need to be made,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also have been generally unsympathetic to the complaints from senior citizens who oppose the financing provision of the program, which helps the elderly and disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten their financial stability. For Medicare-eligible Americans _ those who are over 65 or disabled _ whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $ 150 a year in federal income taxes, the surtax is 15 percent of their income tax this year. Next year it is 25 percent and it could rise by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel was his first before a congressional committee since his confirmation to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` We welcome you to the reality of budget deficits,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the committee `` You'll find us as agreeable as the budget permits.'' The secretary was asked many of the same questions he had been asked at his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a subsequent hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. At those hearings, he deferred on many of the budget questions that were raised, saying he had not participated in detailed budget discussions with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending in fiscal 1990 by $ 5 billion is unacceptable and the effects of the deficit-reducing Gramm-Rudman law are preferable. If Gramm-Rudman cuts were made, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending in 1990 would be reduced by about $ 2 billion. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, however, said the across-the-board cuts of the Gramm-Rudman law would `` tie our hands to utilize funds that are available in the most productive way.'' The secretary also assured the panel that the administration's proposed cutbacks _ chiefly freezing and scaling back increases in payments to hospitals and physicians _ were designed not to affect benefit levels

<HEAD>Slovenian Party Leadership Calls For End To Single-Party Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in the republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has issued an unprecedented call for ending single-party rule in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, newspapers said Tuesday. The party leadership in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most westward-looking of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics, has long advocated the necessity of radical reforms in overcoming the country's worst social and economic crisis. This was the first time, however, that the party's ruling presidium has come out openly in favor of ending one-party rule. `` The end must come to socialist -LRB- Communist -RRB- and all other fundamentalisms,'' said a document formally adopted Monday by <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s party presidium. The document, published Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> daily, was intended to serve as a guideline for upcoming political and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. It alluded to traditional beliefs based on a literal interpretation of Marxism-Leninism and regarded as fundamental to Communist faith. `` Instead of ... single-party rule ... political pluralism should be affirmed,'' the document said. The party will support `` freedom, democracy, political pluralism, economic efficiency'' and the creation of an `` affluent society within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' Vjesnik, another daily, quoted the statement as saying. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has been a single-party state since 1946, when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> abolished all forms of opposition. Recently, however, a number of alternative groups, including a full-fledged <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have been set up in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>. The founding of independent alternative groups has met with vehement opposition in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, where thousands of university students demonstrated last week demanding an end to the groups in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s hard-line party leadership is generally believed to have orchestrated the demonstrations. It has repeatedly called for abolition of the independent groups.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday because it refused to suppress `` The Satanic Verses,'' whose author is under a death sentence by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for blaspheming Islam. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem regime, which has put a price of $ 5.2 million on novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head, said it was determined to defend Islam from foreign insults. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said the 88-year-old patriarch's order that his followers kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen, violated the principles of international relations and the diplomatic rupture was `` entirely of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s making.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> decided Feb. 27 to sever diplomatic ties unless <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> met its demands, expressed as follows in a parliamentary resolution: `` If the British government does not declare in a maximum period of one week its opposition to the unprincipled stand against the <ORGANIZATION> world </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, the Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the contents of the anti-Islamic book ` The Satanic Verses,' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is obliged to break all bilateral political ties.'' Moslems object to what they see as <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s portrayal of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and his implication that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from Allah. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> says the novel, published last year, is a secular study of good and evil that is not meant to offend Moslems. More than a dozen countries have banned the book, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Riots it inspired in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have taken at least 19 lives. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, was born in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, to Moslem parents but has said he no longer practices religion. He has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> pronounced the death sentence and Iranian clerics offered the reward. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that British officials had not received formal notification from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and learned but learned of the action through news reports and a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio broadcast. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, the Iranian premier, said on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state radio that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had made `` a big mistake'' and Moslem countries would not permit their beliefs to be insulted. `` We are prepared to employ all our might in order to defend the borders of our beliefs,'' he said. An Iranian statement accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s clerics consider their worst Western enemy after the `` Great Satan'' <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, of `` being in the front line of plots and treachery against Moslems'' for two centuries. `` The world oppressors and the West, which find genuine Islam against their objectives and their plots, have risen against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of the British government is salient,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> killed, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and its 11 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners _ along with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> _ recalled their ambassadors to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The confrontation with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> quashed attempts by more moderate elements in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to open up to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in hopes of trade and economic assistance in rebuilding after the 8-year-old with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A cease-fire in the war was reached last August. A Foreign Office issued Tuesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said: `` The present situation is entirely of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s making. Incitement to murder is a violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that govern relations between sovereign states. `` It is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s actions which have removed the substance from our relations and made it impossible to conduct normal business.'' The dispute arose as relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were returning to normal. In December, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> re-opened its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which had been closed for eight years. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, whose envoy returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> over the weekend, will resume handling British interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Relatives of the three Britons missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> expressed dismay. The three are believed held by Shiites loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and another Briton, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, is imprisoned in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on espionage charges. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> canceled a scheduled visit to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> on Tuesday by a Swedish diplomat. `` We will have to sit back and wait, rather dismayed,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a cousin of Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. `` Nothing can ever be resolved unless there are discussions with the other side; that was the whole basis of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s life.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of two American hostages. Nine Americans are among the 15 foreign captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, her foreign minister, have said they realize the novel offends Moslems. They insist the death threat be dropped, however, and reject demands that the book be banned and its author prosecuted. In other developments: _ <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Sukarton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmosudjono </PERSON>, said the book would soon be banned in that country _ At least 700 schoolchildren marched in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to protest the novel, and President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should be put on trial _ In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, two buildings at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alberta </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> were shut down for several hours Monday because of a bomb threat protesting a scheduled discussion of `` The Satanic Verses,'' officials said No bomb was found.

 From the Cathedral of <LOCATION> Chartres </LOCATION>' soaring Gothic vaults to <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s weightless <PERSON> Desmoiselles </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Avignon </PERSON>, works of art have long been associated with flight. Now, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>' sculpture `` Boundless Aperture'' is scheduled to take off with the space shuttle Discovery and give art a lift, quite literally, out of this world. The 7-pound cubic sculpture, part of the artist's 20-year effort to stretch the human imagination, is the nation's first and possibly last interstellar art offering. `` If any art went up previously it was done without our knowledge and we certainly do n't approve of it,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Maull </PERSON>, who was staff director for the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> committee that approved <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>'s work for flight. `` And there is no intention to send any other objects up at this time.'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> conceived his `` Boundless Aperture'' sculpture more than two decades ago as part of a larger project entitled `` The Quiet Axis,'' that includes one sculpture embedded in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> floor off <LOCATION> Easter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and another placed in the <LOCATION> Hindu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kush </LOCATION> mountains in central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` Boundless Aperture'' consists of a 6-inch cube inside of which floats another cube bearing colorful holographic plates inscribed with poetry. On its return it will be placed inside a rock outcropping on the DeCordova Museum's grounds in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The artist allows that his latest sculpture is fairly esoteric, but insists that anyone can appreciate space art. `` There are more art enthusiasts out there than the people at the museums,'' he said. `` A lot of people are very eager to see a cultural dimension to the space effort. It's humanizing.''

 Big <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> is losing his marbles.

The panels will be replaced with granite during a facelift that begins next month and could cost up to $ 80 million before its completion in three years, said <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, manager of engineering for <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>. `` We decided to bite the bullet rather than continue forever on a maintenance program,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said Monday of the replacement project. `` We decided to get it over with.''

But <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> did n't leave his work outside.'' The used marble is too weak for buildings and too warped for countertops. Until a buyer is found, the marble will be piled up outside the headquarters, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` This granite is very strong and stable,'' he said. `` I wanted to make sure that 15 years from now someone does n't have to go through what I'm going through.''

 A Democratic senator said Tuesday he had seen Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> `` under the influence of alcohol'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, making the dramatic claim shortly after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted that `` not one'' senator has first-hand evidence that Tower had a drinking problem. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, meanwhile, flatly predicted the nomination would be rejected when it comes to a vote. Even so, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> became the second Democrat to support confirmation. `` I owe John Tower the same fairness and careful judgment he used 22 years ago,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said, referring to Tower's 1967 defense of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, then a senator and the father of the current senator. The elder <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> was censured by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for improper use of campaign funds. Despite <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s decision, Democrats showed increasing confidence in their ability to prevail and as Republicans complained bitterly about the tactics of a key Democratic opponent to the nomination, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. In a riveting exchange on the fourth day of increasingly heated debate, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said he saw Tower `` under the influence of alcohol'' while on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Tower was a senator from 1961 to 1984. `` But inebriated to the point that he could not operate?'' interrupted Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` I have not seen him inebriated to the extent he could not perform his duties,'' replied <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who said later he had seen Tower `` under the influence'' several times But Tower, in a statement, denied the charge, saying, `` I have never been inebriated on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a session earlier Tuesday with White House reporters, repeated his oft-stated insistence that no senators had first-hand information that Tower was hampered by a drinking problem. `` I have n't had one single senator _ not one _ -LRB- who -RRB- served with him over the years, say, ` I have seen him. My first-hand evidence is this man is ineligible because of his consumption of spirits,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that despite the decision Monday of Southern Democrat <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to support Tower, the nomination will lose. `` I believe that when the vote occurs the nomination will be rejected and it is obvious if the Republicans had the votes they would now be demanding the vote take place,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters. `` I frankly see no benefit to anyone ... in unnecessarily and needlessly prolonging this matter,'' he said. But Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said, `` This has just barely started.'' He left open the possibility of asking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to let Tower answer the charges against him on the floor itself. But he seemed to concede it would be a last-ditch attempt to stave off defeat, and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> said Tower had ample opportunity to defend himself before <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s committee. `` If we can see 50 votes, we do n't need to make the request,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` But if we need one or two, the answer is yes ... yes, we're going to make the request. I'd like to hear <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> defend his record in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey shows 47 Democrats and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, leaning against or solidly opposed to confirming Tower, and 40 Republicans and two Democrats either leaning for or supporting confirmation. Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A partisan squabble kicked off the day as <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other Republicans complained about a decision by <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to direct staff from a separate subcommittee that he heads to investigate new allegations of excessive drinking against Tower. `` We are disturbed by this partisan unit under the control'' of Nunn, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` ... I did n't send out any strike force, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> did.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> defended his weekend move, saying the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had told him its agents had completed the probe and he had no other choice but to send <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff. But he said he was dropping the investigation after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had assured him the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> will look into any new allegations. But that was merely a prelude to the fireworks later in the day. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, complained bitterly about comments <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made on a network interview program in which he referred to the `` vicious personal attacks'' on Tower, including <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>' use of the words `` crocked,'' `` sloshed,'' and `` comatose'' from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. In turn, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> bristled at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Democrat's use of the term `` Mr. <PERSON> Alcoholic </PERSON> <PERSON> Abuser </PERSON>,'' in reference to Tower. `` Where's the vicious attack? said the Republican leader. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> tried to cut short the debate when he repeated <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules that lawmakers can not cite excerpts from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. But instead he himself got caught up in an angry exchange with Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, over conclusions drawn from the report. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated his support for Tower and termed the nominee's pledge to swear off alcohol if confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as a `` fail-safe guarantee. `` I think he'll measure up to that qualification. Indeed, he has said he'll never touch another drop of liquor and you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an impromptu White House news conference.

<HEAD>Money-Losing Thrift Ordered to Sell $12 Million Rubens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A savings and loan which lost $ 10 million lost quarter has been ordered by the state to sell a $ 12 million painting bought as office `` furniture'' and hung in the chairman's home. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> recently bought `` Portrait of a Man as Mars,'' by Flemish master <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> from <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house, paying a $ 1.2 million commission in addition to the $ 12 million purchase price. In a March 3 letter, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comptroller </ORGANIZATION> expressed its displeasure with the purchase and ordered the Miami-based bank to sell the painting within 30 days. The state has not yet heard what <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> plans to do about the order, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in the thrift supervising office in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. However, she said it was rare for savings institutions to oppose the comptroller because the office supervises all state-chartered thrifts. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said neither he nor his thrift did anything wrong, and called the dispute a `` tempest in a teapot.'' <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, the chief of the thrift supervision office, said that for the bank to hold the masterpiece `` creates the likelihood of an abnormal risk or loss,'' and called the purchase `` inherently speculative.'' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>'s letter said the comptroller's office did not understand how <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost money for the past two quarters, could justify buying the painting. He questioned why <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who is active in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s art circles, was keeping the painting in his home. `` Your letter indicates that the painting, although currently displayed in your personal residence, was acquired as ` furniture and fixtures of <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> and is reflected on the balance sheet as an asset of the institution,''' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> is in his home only because new executive offices in <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> have not yet been completed. He said the purchase was part of a wise pattern of investing, noting that the average painting has appreciated 15 percent a year recently. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, which has assets of $ 10.2 billion and 68 offices around <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, valued its entire art collection at about $ 20 million. The comptroller's office has a higher estimate of $ 30 million. `` We have been very careful to put together, with the help of the curator of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a museum-quality art collection,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` We're no different than the major banks.''

<HEAD>Spokesman Says Evidence `Indicates' Soviets Killed Polish Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has concluded that `` everything indicates'' that more than 4,000 Polish army officers massacred at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> were killed not by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> but by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police, a spokesman said Tuesday. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said, however, the evidence is circumstantial, and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> continues to press for speed in the Soviet review of one of the most emotional blank spots in Soviet-Polish history. It was the strongest government statement yet pointing to Soviet culpability, although an official newspaper last month published a wartime <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> report indicating the officers were killed on Soviet territory well before the 1941 Nazi invasion of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Urban has said the inscription on a monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> will be changed. `` We think that everything indicates that the crime was committed by the Stalinist <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>,'' the secret police force that preceded the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, Urban said. `` The Soviet historians are analyzing this material and are right to state that it's only circumstantial evidence.'' The officers had been deported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s army uncovered their bodies in spring 1943 in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Official Soviet and Polish histories long held the officers were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians blamed the Soviets. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> formed a joint commission in 1987 to consider the evidence on <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and other historical questions. The Polish side has submitted its material and indications have emerged of growing impatience with the Soviet review. Urban said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> understands the Soviets want to review material in their own archives but `` we are for speeding up the process of looking for them.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was attacked first by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> and then from the east by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in September 1939. Many Poles and Western historians say the Soviets killed the Polish officers in the spring of 1940, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were still observing a non-aggression pact.

 Actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON>, honored Tuesday with columnist <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> and country music singer <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>, pledged to continue the fight `` to free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from its chains of drugs and mental illness.'' The three celebrities were honored by mental health groups for their efforts to build public awareness on the issues of mental illness and addictions and remove the social stigma from these disorders. `` I'm not proud of the fact that I once had a drug problem, but I am proud I did something about it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>, who overcame dependency on prescription drugs, said at an awards reception on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON>, a national spokesman for the campaign for `` A Drug Free America,'' said programs must use education to reach parents, school leaders and teachers about how to spot mental illnesses such as depression that can lead to drug abuse. Then, they must reach out with compassion to those afflicted. `` What we have to do is ... open our arms and say we know how what you're feeling and tell them there are people who care,'' <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> urged: `` Let's be sympathetic, let's be kind, let's be caring and let's recognize the burden these people who have mental illness are carrying I ca n't tell you how much pain, how much suffering is out there.'' The `` From Shame to Hope'' awards were co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Problems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> _ Learning and Educating.

<HEAD>Sandinistas and Rebels Accuse Each Other of Cease-Fire Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government and Nicaraguan rebels on Tuesday accused each other of scores of violations since Jan. 1 of the year-old cease-fire. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels, known as Contras, had fired upon Nicaraguan troops and civilians on 140 occasions since Jan. 1. In <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance organization said Sandinista troops fired on its forces 69 times during January and February. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON> denied the Resistance allegations and said the rebel attacks were `` an open violation of the cease-fire.'' `` We completely respect the cease-fire, but if the Contras attack we have to defend ourselves,'' she told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. She said none of the rebel attacks was `` of great scope.'' The leftist Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels reached a provisional cease-fire agreement in March 1988, but talks on a permanent truce to the 8-year-old civil war stalled in September. Since June the government has extended a unilateral cease-fire on a monthly basis that has been tacitly accepted by the rebels. An estimaed 11,000 Contra guerrillas fled to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance expired in February 1988. They have drawn from $ 27 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid that is to expire at the end of this month. Col. <PERSON> Pasos </PERSON> said `` small, dispersed Contra groups that have lost social support and are desperate because of the scant supplies they receive'' were responsibile for the attacks this year. A statement released by the Sandinista army listed what it said were recent cease-fire violations by the rebels. It gave this account: On Sunday rebels fired into the village of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, 190 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, killing three peasants, including two who belonged to a civilian militia. The day before rebels stopped a truck at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinnuela </LOCATION>, 175 miles east of the capital, and robbed the people aboard the vehicle. On March 1, two people were killed when about 40 rebels fired on a small boat carrying passengers on the <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamaca </LOCATION>, 195 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan Resistance report accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of cease-fire violations said that on Feb. 20 <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, a rebel officer known as Commander <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, was killed in an ambush by government troops in <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> province. `` All of these <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> attacks that constitute a frank violation of the cease-fire declared by the Nicaraguan regime have been denounced to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said.

 A 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruit died during training last year because he was intimidated, because the service neglected safety procedures and because higher-ups pressured the facility to turn out more graduates, congressional investigators said Tuesday. And the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the recruit, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was not the only sailor to die from such lapses in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training schools around the country over the last two years. Investigators said safety problems contributed to five of 16 deaths in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training programs 1986 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said some of the flaws have still not been corrected. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, the agency said, had panicked during a swimming-pool drill known as `` sharks and daisies,'' in which swimmers must free themselves from an instructor who simulates a drowning person and grabs the recruit from behind. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was counseled, given a medical examination and found `` not physically qualified'' for the course because of a phobia of being held under water. Despite the findings, he was enrolled in the class a second time and forced into the pool again. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> left the pool and clutched an equipment rack, shouting `` I quit'' and `` please do n't put me back in the water.'' But instructors dragged him back to the pool. He struggled and was eventually pulled out unconscious but could not be revived. An autopsy led authorities to believe <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died of heartbeat irregularity caused by extreme fear, fatigue and insufficient oxygen. The school's lead instructor was found guilty by a general court-martial of negligent homicide, demoted and confined for 90 days. Eight others associated with the class were given administrative punishments, including demotions and reprimands. Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., who requested the investigtion along with other members of the state's congressional delegation, called <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death `` a tragedy waiting to happen. `` This <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report is a catalog of failures by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which led to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death and others,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> told a news conference. He vowed to see that the remaining problems are resolved and asked Vice Admiral <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Disher </PERSON>, head of the service's training system, to contact families of recruits who died in training `` to tell them what really happened.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it had discussed its findings with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and reported that officials `` generally agreed'' and `` were receptive to suggestions on how to improve training safety and death and mishap investigations.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> initially covered up the reason for <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death, thinking `` this would go away like so many other cases in the past.'' But the persistence of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s family and classmates, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said, brought the truth to light. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that some improvements have been made at the school: The `` sharks and daisies'' drill has been dropped; instructors are better trained; safety equipment is kept by the swimming pool, and there is a clearer policy regarding students' rights to drop out of a course. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that there remains great pressure on students not to drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that doing so will adversely affect their careers, and that there still is no system to alert instructors to students with a history of problems. `` The bottom line,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said, `` is that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> instructors still are not trained to conduct high-risk training and that students still are not screened to make sure they can handle the dangers.'' In <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s case, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> pointed to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> findings that he had untrained and unsupervised instructors and was prevented from dropping out because of pressure on the school to increase the number of graduates it turned out. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also faulted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for its investigation of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death and said the service does n't always investigate such deaths as thoroughly as it should In addition, the investigators wrote that `` the ability of these investigations as presently conducted to identify and address safety issues is questionable.''

 An aide to Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> raised hopes Tuesday for a compromise in a 15-year-old federal desegregation lawsuit against <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s colleges and universities. The court-appointed special master overseeing the integration effort had scheduled a morning hearing but called off the session after meeting with lawyers. Attorneys were to meet with him Wednesday in private, a secretary said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, counsel to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, and state Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier Tuesday that lawyers in the case were getting closer to a settlement. But neither would give details or predict that a settlement would be reached. Nor could they be reached later for comment. Calls to their offices and hotels were not returned. Asked about speculation that a proposed settlement had been drawn up, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I would be pretty sure they've gotten pretty far. But not sure they have gotten that far.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> alumni, said the delay did not mean that settlement was imminent. `` There's nothing to be read into this. Negotiations are always continuing. They never stop. But there are a lot of technical things that have got to be done in conjunction with a hearing like this,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. `` One of those is negotiation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed the lawsuit against the <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> system in 1974. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> all have proposals before special master <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, appointed by a three-judge federal panel to supervise desegregation of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 13 state universities and six two-year colleges. <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>, as one of the nine schools run by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, backs the state's plan But its alumni association, like <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>, objects to what it sees as moves that would eliminate traditionally black schools and deprive underprivileged black youngsters of the help they need to adapt to college life and courses. Those moves include a keystone of the state's plan: consolidating the boards that govern Southern, the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> system and nine regional colleges _ and the board that oversees those three boards _ into one `` superboard.'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he would not budge on the superboard issue but might accept the establishment of weaker, advisory boards without the power to hire, fire or set budgets. The state's plan also calls for a statewide community college system, which Southern and the <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> alumni contend would keep many blacks from ever making it into a four-year university. The Justice, Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> alumni plans depend heavily on moving programs from predominantly white schools to schools that are predominantly black, an arrangement <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says failed in other states that tried it. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and a former dean of <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s law school.

<HEAD>Senators Propose Permanent Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pair of senators introduced legislation Tuesday to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all domestic flights, a bill that immediately received the endorsement of Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. The measure would expand the current prohibition against smoking, which covers flights of two hours or less and is due to expire in April 1990. `` The time has come to protect the health and safety of all airline passengers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. At the senators' news conference to announce the proposal, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said such a ban is `` long overdue.'' He cited a recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> which found that passengers in non-smoking sections of airliners had similar levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine to travelers in smoking areas. The bill would leave intact the $ 1,000 fine that can be levied against those violating the smoking ban, and the $ 2,000 penalty for people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms.

 <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, the teen-ager who received a dead admirer's heart when her own failed, died unexpectedly in her sleep Tuesday while awaiting a second transplant. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, 17, died around noon at her home in the central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where the first transplant was performed. `` Her death today comes as a severe shock,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, the girl's pediatric cardiologist. `` <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> was seen by us last week, and was in pretty good shape,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said her condition recently was `` very stable'' and described the girl as being cheerful and in good spirits. Although doctors were n't certain what caused her death, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> suspected cardiac arrhythmia, the irregular beating of the heart. The arrhythmia probably led to cardiac arrest and sudden death just three weeks before the girl's 18th birthday, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, who was taking a nap, probably did not awaken, he added. Her body had repeatedly tried to reject the heart of 15-year-old <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, which she received after <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> died in January 1986. The girl's case drew international attention when it was reported that <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, who had a crush on his high school classmate, had told his parents he wanted to leave her his heart after his death. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>'s death shocked hospital staff members, said <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Presbyterian spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Millhouse </PERSON>. `` We're very saddened by it,'' she said. `` There are many people at this hospital who have gotten close to her over the year. She turned to the hospital as a place to have friends and get out of the limelight.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the son of farm laborers who had been suffering from blackouts and headaches when he talked with his parents about donating his heart, died suddenly on Jan. 4, 1986 after a blood vessel burst in his brain. `` I hope that what Peno -LRB- <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> -RRB- did shows how people can help each other,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said in a statement 12 days after the transplant surgery. `` I was surprised when <PERSON> Dad </PERSON> told me about <PERSON> Peno </PERSON> and what he had done for me. I felt very sad, but thankful for what he did.''

The government condemned the strike late Tuesday in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, saying the walkouts `` constitute illegal actions that are contrary to the public interest.'' `` The damage suffered by students is irreversible and no one has the right to injure youth,'' it added. The government offered to consider teachers' grievances through dialogue. Virtually all public schools in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were closed. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported scattered walkouts at schools nationwide, with dissident teachers from at least 17 states participating in the march in the capital. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has 32 states and the federal district of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Many of the teachers in the march had pay stubs pinned to their clothing. Teachers make an average $ 170 a month, and the dissidents are seeking a 100 per cent pay raise. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s minimum monthly wage is about $ 75. `` We barely earn more than common laborers, those who sweep floors, but we have to have a lot more education'' secondary-school teacher <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Marching were members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolteachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, a faction opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 1.2 million teachers and education workers. The dissidents claim <PERSON> Jongitud </PERSON> has used his 17 years as union leader to gain power and wealth while ignoring the plight of the teachers. `` A E I O U! Out With Jongitud!'' the marchers chanted. One large banner showed <PERSON> Jongitud </PERSON> riding a stick horse labeled `` <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>,'' the initials of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which counts on organized labor as one of it strongest supporters. <PERSON> Jongitud </PERSON> is closely allied with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and is now the senator from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Potosi </LOCATION> state. The dissidents claim leaders of the national union sell teaching jobs for about $ 2,100 each. The government does not recognize the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolteachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Second Government Official Arrested In Recruit Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a former vice labor minister on charges of bribery in connection with a widening stock-profiteering scandal involving top government leaders. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, 58, became the highest-ranking public official to be arrested in the unfolding scandal after <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kano </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s employment service division, who was taken in Feb. 17. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, former executive of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an employment-information conglomerate, was apprehended by prosecutors on charges of bribing <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>. That brought to 11 the total number of scandal-related arrests to date. Two Recruit officials who were arrested Feb. 15 were freed Tuesday by the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> District Prosecutor's Office. The office has yet to decide whether they will be indicted. Recruit is at the center of the scandal in which a select number of individuals, particularly politicians, were offered the opportunity to purchase bargain-priced shares of a real estate subsidiary up until September 1986. When the shares were offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986, their value rose substantially and holders were able to earn hefty profits. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>'s arrest had been expected for weeks. Prosecutors had been questioning him over the past few days over his ties to Recruit. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> allegedly purchased 3,000 unlisted shares in a <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in September 1986 and earned a windfall of about $ 53,000 a month later, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted prosecutors as saying. The former vice labor minister, who retired voluntarily in January 1988, has been accused of providing special favors to Recruit during his 1983-85 tenure as director general of the ministry's <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Higashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, former head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested on charges of accepting bribes from Recruit. The Recruit scandal has severely damaged the reputation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, whose support rating has dwindled to 21.3 percent in the latest poll by the mass circulation daily <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers resigned after reports that they directly or indirectly purchased Recruit stock. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has denied personal involvement in the scandal but has acknowledged his own aide bought 2,000 shares of Recruit stock.

 Road crews plowed and pedestrians trudged through the slushy remains of a snowstorm that canceled a presidential visit Tuesday in the Northeast, disrupted <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> for a second day and caused a 20-mile backup in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It's history now,'' meteorologist <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said of the storm blamed for 29 deaths. `` Fortunately it's March and it will start turning back to warmer weather.'' Before the storm moved from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>, it tangled the morning rush hour in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and knocked out electricity to 40,000 customers at <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and along the Eastern Shore from <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and thousands more in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Utility workers battled ice, strong winds and frigid temperatures to restore power lines. Schools closed in several states. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where up to 16 inches of snow fell, a 61-year-old woman who went outside to get wood for her stove apparently froze to death as temperatures dipped into the teens Tuesday, police said. `` She went out to get the wood in her house coat and socks and she fell and passed out'' 40 yards from her front door, said <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Locust </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, a pregnant woman and her husband had to wade through waist-deep snow when their truck got stuck in snow on the way to the hospital. The baby was delivered by a paramedic in a nearby house. Forecasters in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, however, predicted a sudden rise in temperatures as high as the 80s later this week. In southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where winds of 15 mph made temperatures in the low 30s seem like 5 to 10 degrees, highs were expected to reach the 60s by Saturday. A backup on Interstate 35 in northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prompted about 100 truck drivers to park their rigs in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. About half needed tow trucks to get on their way again Tuesday, he said. At least 450 stranded motorists spent the night in churches, homes and a high school in the tiny town of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where their plight elicited gifts of food, blankets and cots from many of the 514 residents. `` I've never seen an outpouring of kindness like this,'' said one of the motorists, <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrbach </PERSON> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, who spent the night in a pew. Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefaivre </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said the main roads in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area were open, `` but traffic was very heavy. The secondary roads are going to remain covered until it gets a lot warmer.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. The Missouri Legislature, which called off its session the day before, was delayed several hours Tuesday morning. Snowfall since the weekend accumulated to a foot or more along a swath from <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, into <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, with 10 inches in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and up to a foot in northern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where the collapse of 280 poultry houses left up to $ 35 million in damage and dead birds. Snow flurries and freezing drizzle were reported Tuesday morning as far south as Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Because of dangerous driving conditions, some schools closed in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Carbondale </ORGANIZATION> shut its doors for only the third time in a decade Rain caused flooding across southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, closing roads in 14 counties.

<HEAD>Peru Seeks to Overcome Effects of Failed Land Reform</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CANETE, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the ancient <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> thrived on this Andean nation's stingy soil, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> today has farming woes that drain its funds and leave it short of food. Analysts say the major culprit is a land reform program, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest, that has failed to keep modern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s feeble farm production growing at the same pace as the population. `` Agriculture was mortally wounded by the agrarian program,'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent editorial bemoaning the 20th anniversary of the event. Many people think the spreading chaos in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> _ marked by the flight of hundreds of thousands of highland peasants to city slums, a deep economic recession and a leftist guerrilla insurgency _ has been aggravated by the failure of land reform. Politicians and agronomists alike are frantically seeking solutions and they hope recent legislation will help. The issue is reflected by `` The Castle,'' an ornate mansion on a former cotton barron's estate. It sits like a fading symbol on the outskirts of <PERSON> Canete </PERSON>, an oasis town on the desert coast 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the capital. Like hundreds of other large farms, the estate's 1,500 acres were expropriated and organized into a cooperative for the 100 peasant families who had worked the land as virtual serfs. Today The Castle lies abandoned and deteriorating, much like the agrarian reform instituted by the leftist military ruler at the time, Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>. But its surrounding fertile farmlands have begun to reflect their former glory since the government allowed the cooperatives to be divided up among their members. `` Under <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON> we all made good money, but no one wanted to work,'' said <PERSON> Jubilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ensiso </PERSON>, 42, one of The Castle's farmers. `` They'd spend just four or six hours in the fields. `` Now we put in twice that because we are working for ourselves.'' He farms 11 acres of corn, cotton and pumpkins. <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>'s land reform program sought to break the aristocracy's grip over the countryside His aim was to distribute income and increase farm output. About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program outside of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control. Analysts say the program eventually failed in a morass of inefficiency due to poor planning and execution. Fewer than 20 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s landless peasants actually received land, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a private social research center. Since the program began in 1969, farm output has grown slightly more than 1 percent yearly, while the population grew by 2.5 percent a year. As a result successive governments have had to increase imports of food staples. The 1988 foreign grocery bill reached $ 600 million, one-quarter of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s export earnings. The problem was aggravated when the debt-strapped government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> late last year ran low of foreign currency to pay for the imports. Sporadic shortages of wheat, dried milk and other staples have plagued <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> since then, and the government has asked other nations for emergency food. Modern farming woes contrast sharply with the success of the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>, who routinely had a surplus after feeding a population estimated at more than half of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s current 21 million. Though the Spanish destroyed the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>' highly organized society, some of their agricultural expertise, including desert irrigation canals and mountain terraces, is still widely applied by Peruvian peasants today. `` The Incas were probably the best agronomists in the world. They had to be to survive,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Dourojeanni </PERSON>, a professor at <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dourojeanni </PERSON> says just 3 percent of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which is roughly the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> combined, is suitable for cultivation. Five years ago the government drastically modified the failing reform program and began allowing cooperatives to cut their lands into parcels, with equal sections going to members to reap whatever profits they could. Farmer <PERSON> Ensiso </PERSON> says output since then at the former cotton estate here has grown about 20 percent since then, a figure he says is generally true of other cooperatives that divided up their lands. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s total farm production rose 7 percent in 1988, compared with a 9 percent decline in the economy as a whole. Specialists say the agricultural troubles are far from resolved but agree the modifications in land reform are helping.

 Despite 10 years of peace, Israelis living in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> still face resentment and are forced to keep a low profile for reasons of politics and security. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, on a rare trip to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> by a senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, tried to raise <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> visibility recently by visiting this state-owned farm where Israeli experts are involved in an irrigation project. `` This project is a big success,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said, `` and being a big success it will become well known.'' The project was started in 1986 but was kept quiet until the foreign minister came with a busload of journalists. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s agriculture minister, <PERSON> Yussef </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>, noted that while the project had not been publicized in <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> media it is highly visible to Egyptians because it is about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on a main highway to <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` It is seen by thousands of people, and this is real publicity for the project,'' <PERSON> Wali </PERSON> said. The farm, however, has no sign to show that Israeli experts are there watching over such crops as chilis, sweet peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers. A large green-and-white billboard, however, announces Saudi Arabian cooperation in other aspects of the farm. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuk </PERSON>, 38, one of a half-dozen <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agriculture advisers here, said he had no specific instructions to hide his presence. But he added that political events sometimes made the atmosphere tense and he avoids sensitive topics. One such topic is the 15-month Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Israeli soldiers have killed more than 390 Arabs. `` We never talk about political subjects,'' <PERSON> Zuk </PERSON> said. `` They do n't bring it up and neither do I. I feel comfortable with the people I am working with and do n't feel any rejection.'' Thousands of Israeli tourists have visited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signed the peace treaty March 26, 1979, that ended three decades of war. About 100 Israeli Embassy staff members and their families now live in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, but only about a dozen non-official Israelis work in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on a full-time basis. <PERSON> Ovadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON>, 48, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agronomist who lives in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> with his wife and three of his five children, said the relationship between Israelis and Egyptians remains tentative, complex and often emotional. `` The peace agreement is not something that you can switch on and off. You make the peace gradually, breaking through one barrier and then another. I believe that peace will survive the occasional ups and down. What we have to do is understand each other.'' <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, speaks Arabic fluently and has a good knowledge of the country. His family was forced out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> after the 1956 Suez war, and <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON> became a settler in the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> after it was captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He then fought as an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier on the Egyptian front in the war of 1973, was uprooted from his Sinai settlement by the 1979 peace agreement and returned to work in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> five years ago. In the beginning, he said he was afraid for his safety but eventually decided to stay. `` If I could n't start here who could?'' he said <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON> said his battle for acceptance has produced mixed results. He recalled that when his daughter was 5 years old she was excluded from the birthday party of her best friend because her friend's parents did n't want an Israeli in their home `` She was very hurt and sad,'' he said. When his daughter turned 6, <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON> had a birthday party in a restaurant and his daughter's friend attended. `` We met the parents there and became friendly,'' he said. `` One of the parents studied with my cousin.'' The Keidars now visit the Egyptian family in their home. But the Egyptian family, who are related by marriage to Palestinians, have yet to visit the <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON> home. `` There are still some barriers because of the Palestinian problem, but I can understand them,'' said <PERSON> Keidar </PERSON>, adding he believed relations would remain uneasy with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> until there was a negotiated settlement of the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The low point in <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> relations came Oct. 5, 1985, when seven Israeli tourists were killed when an Egyptian policeman opened fire on a beach party at <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bourka </LOCATION> in the Sinai. The policeman, <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatir </PERSON>, was sentenced to life in prison. He died in jail as a result of what authorities said was a suicide. Earlier the same year, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Atrakchi </PERSON>, 30, was assassinated by a gunman in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The only resident Israeli correspondent in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizrachi </PERSON> of the liberal newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, moves frequently to avoid being targeted after the Egyptian weekly <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahali </PERSON> described him as a dangerous man and published his address. Other Israelis, he said, use bodyguards because of resentment among Egyptians. <PERSON> Mizrachi </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> about six months, recalled that <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> journalists once demanded he leave a news conference. `` One of them called out that there was an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> present, and they would not participate if I did. So I left.'' <PERSON> Mizrachi </PERSON> said, however, he was able to move freely to cover the news, visiting neighborhoods throughout <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and even the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Organization </LOCATION>. A former commander of Israeli troops in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mizrachi </PERSON> recently interviewed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, risking censure and possible prosecution at home for dealing with the outlawed group.

 As `` Baby M'' turns 3 this month, the controversy that surrounded her birth to a surrogate mother has diminished little. More than 60 bills have been introduced in state legislatures and three in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban, regulate or study surrogacy since the March 27, 1986, birth to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> of the little girl she was paid $ 10,000 to carry. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, as Baby M now is named, lives with <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tenafly </LOCATION>, with one six-hour visit a week from her biological mother. Her parents wo n't talk about the case, their daughter, or the woman who bore her and is now engaged in a 22-city promotional tour for her book, `` A Mother's Story.'' `` I really thought this was something special,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, now married to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, whose child _ her fifth _ she is expecting in July. `` I really thought it was a way for an empty-armed couple to have a child.'' `` I really was naive,'' she said recently. She criticized the clinic where she was inseminated with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s sperm for inadequately explaining the process and how she might feel, but realizes she should have asked more questions. `` I thought it was something so wonderful. You do n't think of the bad. ... I did n't want to hurt the Sterns. It was very hard to tell them, ` No, you ca n't have the baby''' she named <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> _ the name on the birth certificate. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> returned the $ 10,000 to <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. The case `` alerted the public to in vitro research,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer for Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> who has been working for the past year with the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrogacy </ORGANIZATION>. `` You just ca n't take somebody's baby away from them. All these things had never been addressed in a contract,'' <PERSON> Arenstein </PERSON> said. The coalition sees surrogacy as `` a creation of tragedy,'' said its lawyer, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON>. The group was established partly to provide low-cost legal aid to women involved in surrogacy contracts and as a support network for them. Among supporters of surrogacy is <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` One out of seven married couples in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are infertile,'' <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> said. `` Since medical science has now figured out a way for a couple to have a child through artificial insemination, it ought to be legalized but be well-regulated. `` If adoption can be well-regulated then surrogacy can be well-regulated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, while awarding custody of Baby M to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, last year outlawed surrogacy for pay in the state. State Sen. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> has introduced a bill to regulate arrangements for surrogacy contracts. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> have declared surrogacy contracts void and unenforceable. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> also assesses criminal penalties for paid surrogacy. An <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law prohibits the state from enforcing a surrogacy contract. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> surrogacy-for-hire is illegal, but a woman can voluntarily bear a child for someone else and be reimbursed for medical and some living expenses. At least three bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban surrogacy, to prohibit federal enforcement of the contracts and to bar use of federal money to help veterans get children through surrogacy. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, without endorsing surrogate motherhood, last month offered a blueprint for legalizing surrogacy. It suggested that contracts be limited to married couples and a surrogate mother who would have 180 days to change her mind after conception. A judge would have to approve the pact before conception, and the egg or the sperm would have to come from the couple. <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON> believes surrogacy will be debated until it's legalized in three or four states where all couples will go. `` The whole idea is to protect kids, and having no statute is giving them the least amount of protection,'' he said. `` A Mother's Story,'' written with investigative journalist <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz-Nobel </PERSON> and published by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, begins with the birth and is limited by court order only to Baby M's second birthday The Sterns tried to block the book, arguing it would exploit the child. Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, 31, said she wrote the book so her daughter would know her side of the story, and to help her other children cope with the case. `` It's pretty much over for me,'' she said. `` But I hope if one woman reads this, she will think again about her doing it.''

 It's probably the first time during the course of an interview that the star has been told, `` Get out of the trash!'' No, the star is not <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. She is Cinnamon, a red Doberman pinscher, a rescue dog whose job it is to search through forests, lakes or earthquake rubble to find people. `` The only thing Cinnamon loves more than people is doughnuts,'' notes Cinnamon's owner and trainer, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, explaining why Cinnamon keeps dipping her nose into the conference room trash can seeking the discarded remains of a pastry. Cinnamon is one of the dogs taken to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to help find victims buried beneath the massive 1985 earthquake. And she is among the remarkable working dogs featured in the National Geographic special, `` Those Wonderful Dogs,'' airing tonight on PBS. `` Those Wonderful Dogs'' is a fascinating and lovingly photographed film that will please dog-lovers enormously but does n't get overly sentimental It was written and produced by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jampel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> provides the narration. The special is dedicated to the memory of film editor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON>, who did such an excellent job of putting it all together. Other dogs featured in the special include sheepdogs, combat dogs, dogs who assist the disabled and sled dogs. The special ranged as far as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to observe a team of 10 sheepdogs who help one couple manage a huge, remote sheep farm. `` Without the dogs,'' says farmer <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, `` we'd be broke in 12 months.'' He observes that his dogs are willing to work till they drop, and all they seek in return is approval from their master. There are two different kinds of sheepdogs, the ones who nip at the heels of the sheep and `` headers,'' who control the sheep from in front by staring into their eyes. Once the sheep are in the pens, the dogs run across the backs of the packed herd to move them along. The special moves on to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> takes the filmmakers through the training regimen that has produced her champion sled teams, regular winners of the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled race. One of the most touching segments is set in a more mundane environment, a typical <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> home, where lives 17-year-old <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON>, a victim of spina bifida who uses a wheelchair, and his yellow Labrador retriever, Zest. Zest is a product of California-based Canine Companions for Independence. Similar to a Seeing Eye dog, she helps her owner by pulling his wheelchair, turning off light switches, picking up dropped objects _ and serving as an ice-breaker. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> says he used to be too shy to approach other students at his school, but now they come up to him to pet the dog. If you grew up on `` Lassie,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> will disappoint you when she insists that rescue dogs like Cinnamon are n't aware that they are saving people's lives, but are only playing a hide-and-seek game. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> is a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dogs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose members found dozens of survivors beneath the rubble of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> earthquake. Cinnamon herself was responsible for finding eight people, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> says. Cinnamon also searches for people who have wandered into wilderness areas and become lost. She even locates drowning victims, riding in a boat and detecting the gases emitted by a body beneath the water. Maybe Cinnamon does n't know she's saving lives, but she does have a different signal when she finds a live person _ `` she wags her behind'' _ than the more subdued scratching at the surface when she finds a dead person. Rescue dogs have to be trained to ignore their natural instinct to jump off unstable surfaces. They are taught to walk a horizontal ladder so they become more aware of the position of their hind feet. Rescue dogs are selected for their love of all people. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said many dogs will search all day for their beloved owner, but do n't care about strangers. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said she picked Cinnamon, now 8 -LCB-, out of litter of pups because she was the one most eager for human contact. Sure enough, though she had only just met her `` interviewer,'' she happily administered a face-washing.

 Nobody loves to hate people like people love to hate auto mechanics. If your car is broken, you need it fixed right away. But you sometimes ca n't get it fixed right away and it costs too much when it is fixed _ if it was fixed right. And you ca n't really understand what that mechanic is saying anyway. Is all that gobbledygook just the cover for a rip-off? It's all a matter of communication, according to the head of an award-winning school for auto mechanics, who says communication skills and ethics are just as important in the curriculum as gaskets and spark plugs. `` One of the most difficult things is to be able to communicate in a two-way fashion,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diklich </PERSON>, coordinator of the automobile technology program at <ORGANIZATION> Longview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a basic element of distrust on both sides. I've found that customers often do n't want to have their cars fixed because it is going to be an inconvenience and expensive. So they let it go and the problem gets worse and it becomes more expensive.'' The <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> auto tech student spends about two-thirds of the time working on mechanics and about one-third in liberal arts classes. `` We try to work with the technical student on communication skills, consumer attitudes, work ethic and attitude as a part of what we do,'' <PERSON> Diklich </PERSON> said. Students study, for example, composition and reading or speech or American history along with courses on diagnosis and repair of automotive brake systems. <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> this year won the annual competition of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The school had finished second in the prestigious competition last year. Students enrolled at <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> have the option of following one program that is closely linked with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or Toyota. They get half their training at the school and spend half their time working in the shop at a manufacturer's dealership. They later find jobs working for a dealership. Students can also get a more general training that qualifies them to work in other repair shops such as service stations. On a tour of the school's new 22,000-square-foot building, instructor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> shows off a huge garage with several ports for cars, the latest in diagnostic equipment, well-equipped classrooms and well-stocked parts rooms. `` They wo n't find anything out there -LRB- in equipment -RRB- that we do n't have here,'' said <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> The parking lot at <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> is filled with cars donated to the school for students to work on, including a late model Cadillac with the latest in on-board computer technology. `` The technology of the car has increased,'' said <PERSON> Diklich </PERSON>. `` The amount of material we have to teach has more than doubled since the 1970s. But they come from the high school and now have had experience with computers and with electronics. It is still basically using diagnostic procedures to find out what is wrong.'' Demand for qualified mechanics is high, particularly in rural areas. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> estimates a shortage of 125,000 mechanics qualified to work on its cars. `` Training has become more necessary,'' <PERSON> Diklich </PERSON> said. `` The manufacturers recognize this and they have begun looking to the colleges and universities for help. The manufacturers can train the current model technology. But they ca n't develop the background for the future.''

<HEAD>MLK's Son, President Of King Center, Picks Up Civil Rights Mantle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The younger son of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> became heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's 60th birthday <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> declared that he, `` the son of a son of a movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to demand their share of the American Dream. For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home. But <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is a quiet man with a small circle of friends, lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a degree of reluctance. `` I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was inevitable,'' he said. `` It surprised a lot of people, including myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily prepare for. `` I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's role. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s Jan. 14 appointment as president of The King Center, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone to take up the torch had been heavy. When <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> made the announcement she pointed out that <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led bus boycotts in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, that sparked the civil rights movement. `` Being the son of the civil rights leader makes <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> uniquely qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a member of the center's board of directors and a longtime contemporary of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>'s selection showed `` we are moving forward, carrying on with another generation.'' King says he does n't want to have to fight with his father's image `` I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes. I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain things you just ca n't inherit.'' Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _ that went to younger sister <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> _ but <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> does sound and look like his dad. `` What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self. And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ... but not because people say ` You're going to follow in your father's footsteps.' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, dean of the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. International Chapel at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, sees <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> as a peaceful man who will function well as president of the center `` He seems natural for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very polite, he's very considerate. `` He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON>, but he's capable of passion and has believability. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who has known King for about four years, said he never knew whether the MLK image was a problem for <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>; he never let it show. King, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> _ his father's alma mater _ but has not graduated, is founder and president of <ORGANIZATION> Visionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a business and development consulting firm. He also directs the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced a record marking the first federal King holiday in 1986. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he was first considered for president of The King Center two years ago, when there was `` some talk amongst the board members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children into a leadership role. But <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON>, 33, serves as the center's producing director of cultural affairs and runs a theater group with <PERSON> Attallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON>, daughter of the late <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a retiring, soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioner; and <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON>, 25, is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` At that time, I was not specifically targeted,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` Recently, ... our immediate family more or less talked about the fact that my mother is not getting any younger.'' He explained that the changes, effective April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of his father's assassination _ would `` free my mother up and allow us to work as a team.'' King will manage the center's administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and chief executive officer Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting young people excited about a movement they are too young to remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and non-violent teachings. Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial base, he said, with an endowment `` that allows us to institutionalize our work so that we're not just trying to hang on day by day or donation by donation.'' He hopes it wo n't be too lonely at the top. `` I do n't know a lot of young national and international leaders, but I will be thrust into that role. It is lonely, and it is frustrating because you really want to have people around you who can really understand where you're coming from.''

 Housing discrimination against families with children is illegal starting Sunday, but no-kids communities are fighting to protect their lifestyles even as experts laud the new law for addressing a national crisis. `` There will be resistance -LRB- and -RRB- claims of reverse discrimination, but the fact of the matter is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has decided families with children have a great need for housing and this law is designed to help them,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, staff attorney for the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. A 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> study found that 75 percent of rental units nationwide banned or restricted children. Other surveys found 90 percent of apartment complexes in some communities closed to children. `` We just found an epidemic of discrimination against families with children all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was really tragic,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 signed into law by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in September The act bans discrimination against families with children, with some exemptions, and adds the handicapped to housing law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, national origin, color and race. `` Blatant and legal cases of discrimination against families with children ... -LRB- are -RRB- happening all over the country and in all types of communities,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> of the Washington-based Children's Defense Fund. _ In <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> were forced in January to evict their 14-year-old daughter <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> rather than go to jail for contempt of court in a dispute over deed restrictions She can visit their mobile home in a subdivision of 17 families north of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, but must live with a married brother until she turns 15 next month. Pets are allowed, but not children under 15. `` I'm not surprised. The Constitution is n't made for kids,'' <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> said. _ In <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 9, was threatened with eviction when she moved in with her father and stepmother after her mother died After months of uncertainty, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> got a reprieve in January when the condominium board decided not to take action while the new federal housing act was researched. _ A <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, couple were forced to send their 3-year-old son to live with friends because of a dispute with neighbors at apartments that had been converted into condominiums with a no-children rule `` Of course we could n't just banish him into a black hole'' and he returned for clothes and toys, said his mother, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Benyahich </PERSON>. After neighbors saw him she got a call from the board's lawyer, who said if he came again `` for any reason they were going to send the sheriff out to remove him.'' _ In <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a judge mediated an agreement allowing 46-year-old <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> to be a guest for 60 days in the condo she and her husband <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON>, 60, bought at the <ORGANIZATION> Rossmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Condominiums </ORGANIZATION> The condo association had not allowed the couple, who live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to buy property because Mrs. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> was n't 48. The judge's Sept. 15 agreement allowed them to buy the weekend home The new housing rules allow age restrictions in retirement communities if all residents are over 62, or if at least 80 percent of the households have at least one member over 55 and special services are offered for older people, or in housing sponsored by state and federal programs for the elderly. Under a transition provision, those who are under the minimum age and were living in an elderly development as of Sept. 13, 1988, will not have to give up their residence nor will the community jeapordize its exemption. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> defends the child-free lifestyle he enjoys at a <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION> condominium that is changing its documents to remain exempt. His sentiments are widely shared, especially among mostly elderly developments. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oriole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Condominium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said many of his neighbors are infirm and under nurses' care, and besides, `` No one would like to have a squirrely kid next door crying in the middle of the night. `` This is our lifestyle. I'm satisfied with what we have now.'' While retirement communities are essentially exempted, adults-only developments around the country will be affected by the act. Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poliakoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> contends the act encourages discrimination against the 18 - to 55-year-olds who live in adult communities, and probably wo n't open much existing housing to children <PERSON> Poliakoff </PERSON>, whose firm represents 1,700 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> communities, says most of those affected have smaller units, recreational facilities designed for adults and a surrounding social infrastructure that's not oriented to families Mobile home parks also present a special situation. `` The people who make up our membership are not elderly in the usual sense. They're active retirees, social and do n't want to live next door to children,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conture </PERSON>. Some may have to under the new law. Mobile-home-park owners and apartment managers now face having to make developments kid-friendly with playgrounds and safety fences or figure out if they qualify for exemption as retirement havens. In areas with age restrictions, reaction to the act has been mixed, but some people are clearly upset they may have to give up adult-only living. `` We do n't think that you can just take a whole neighborhood and say we do n't want to live with children,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` Children have rights too.'' Sixteen states have barred housing discrimination on the basis of familial status, but experts say the laws are generally weak and contain huge loopholes. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 prohibited discrimination against families with children in apartment rentals and later extended that to condos. Mobile home parks have been exempt, a provision the federal law will override. But families still face subtler discrimination, such as limits on the number of occupants, complexes with segregated areas for adults and families with children, and other restrictive rules, said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. About a third of the housing complaints received by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Department of Fair Employment and Housing involve children, he said. Enforcement of the 1988 act will rest with the states, if their housing law is substantially equivalent to federal law and enforcement mechanisms already in place are recertified by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The federal housing agency will handle cases in those states that are n't equipped to deal with housing complaints The period to file a complaint has been extended from 180 days to a year, and an administrative law judge will now be able to hear a case and award actual damages, injunctive relief or top civil penalties of $ 50,000. At the federal court level, a $ 100,000 cap on punitive damages has been eliminated. And the federal government, previously only able to seek injunctive relief, will be able to seek civil penalties up to $ 100,000 against violators. `` Everybody needs to be educated about what the law says,'' said <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON>. `` I think we'll begin to see fairly dramatic changes.''

 From feudal <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to hill tribe villages in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> family has offered medicine, fruit trees, primer readers _ and the <LOCATION> Bible </LOCATION> _ to impoverished Asians for nearly seven decades. Members of the Morse missionary clan also rescued downed pilots in World War II, suffered torture at the hands of Chinese revolutionaries and hid for six years in a jungle valley from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military rulers. Along the way they picked up a dozen languages and about that many diseases in a four-generation odyssey across a vast, wild swath of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Today, the <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> family has grown to 75 members and more than half live in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, a tolerant haven for many Western missionaries forced by political upheavals to uproot from other corners of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. While trying to spread Christianity, the <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION> carry out basic development work with groups like the <LOCATION> Lisu </LOCATION> tribe and attempt to help the tribes cope with rapid economic and social changes sweeping the hills. More than 400 hill tribe children _ <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> and animist _ live in a Morse-run hostel when they come down from their villages for schooling in this northern hub. `` Since we grew up like them in very basic conditions, we can act as liaisons between where they have been and where they are going,'' says 40-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>. `` We hope to be a moderating influence. We hope that they do n't jump from the jungle into the 21st century without being ready.'' The work, <PERSON> David </PERSON> adds, is in some ways more complex than the stark, life-or-death situations that faced his grandfather and family patriarch, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, when he and his wife, <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON>, left their native <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. While today's Morses shop in <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> supermarkets, family chronicles say <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> had to take along a five-month supply of candles on the journey to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1921. The trip took four months, with <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> clutching an infant son while being carried along mountain ledges in a sedan chair shouldered by opium-smoking coolies. `` Today a lot of missionaries regard what they do as a job they can quit. They're softies by comparison,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>, another grandchild. `` Papa Morses' generation went out for life.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s sons recalled in interviews that the family put up with the vermin, desolation and banditry of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> but found the medieval, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> world impenetrable to their message. In 1927, they left for the tri-border area of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a region of dank jungles, remote tribes and towns razed by civil war. They also parted with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and have since remained a one-family missionary outfit dependent on support from individual churches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. During World War II, the <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION>, in touch with the Allied command, recommended flight paths through the rugged borderlands, urged tribespeople to aid downed pilots and themselves rescued several airmen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and two of his sons later were decorated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through the 1949 victory of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s Communists but was arrested in 1951, jailed and tortured. Fifteen months later, he was released without explanation and deported to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, arriving with $ 1.70 in his pocket. The family regrouped in <LOCATION> Putao </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, where diseases and famine were ravaging the <LOCATION> Lisu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawang </LOCATION>, with authorities unable to offer much assistance. The <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION> say that besides setting up a clinic, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and family members laid out new, sanitation-conscious villages and planned irrigation canals. A literacy drive was started and son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, now a well-regarded linguist, worked on setting five tribal languages into written form where none had previously existed. A fruit industry, which still thrives today, was initiated, with <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> experimenting with a variety of trees. He trained a corps of grafters, presenting successful ones with pocket knives that became local status symbols. The Morses and some of their colleagues like to describe those days as the golden age of missionaries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> despite the hardships and frequent bouts of everything from dengue fever to the plague. Then, the lack of resources or interest in the hinterlands by governments turned the <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION> into doctors, teachers, builders, farmers and sometimes even de facto government officials. Following a coup in 1962 by strongman Gen. <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, missionaries were ordered to leave <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Instead, the now-extended <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> family and more than 5,000 tribespeople fled into a no-man's land along the Burmese-Indian border. In a <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> Crusoe-type existence, they cleared the jungle floor for fields, built houses with virtually no tools and hunted monkeys and other game for food. <PERSON> David </PERSON> fabricated an electric generator from a downed Allied aircraft, lubricating the machine with bacon rind. Burmese troops finally broke into their `` Hidden Valley,'' as a book about their life described it. Jailed in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the younger <PERSON> Morses </PERSON>, who spoke better <LOCATION> Lisu </LOCATION> than English, struggled with doorknobs and had to be taught how to use bathrooms. Northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> proved a kind of trail's end for the <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION> as it has for other missionaries expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Thai authorities take a live-and-let-live attitude, and the area is populated by half a million ethnic minorities, many belonging to tribes the missionaries had worked with in other countries. In a quiet, old-style compound of teak houses and towering trees, the <ORGANIZATION> Morses </ORGANIZATION> hold informal family councils and <PERSON> David </PERSON> produces hymns from self-designed computer programs. The Morses include nurses, preachers, doctors and housewives-turned-accountants; midwestern American types, Asian spouses and a fourth generation of toddlers growing up in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> has died but <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, now 91 years old, lives in retirement in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> wishes he could still be out here. He has his heart in the work and prays for everybody,'' says <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, a daughter-in-law. `` He likes to remember the fruit trees of Putao.''

 To the untrained eye, the computer-generated aerial map shows only a triangle of red next to a field of blue. But the image produced by heat-sensing scanners developed by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is of a 17th-century Spanish mission. `` It's fantastic,'' said archaeology curator <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Museum of Natural History. `` I never saw anything so magical in my life.'' The scanners picked out what is left of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toloco </ORGANIZATION> in a cow pasture dotted in spring with tiny purple flowers. Researchers have found what they believe are the kitchen, priests' residence, church and cemetery The Daedalus Multispectral Scanner, developed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Space Remote Sensing Center, differentiate soil from clay and other early construction materials by differences in heat absorption. Computers create images showing differences as small as a half-degree. The instruments will revolutionize archaeology, <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON> said, noting they saved $ 10,000 and five years' work. `` If we started digging trenches, it would take forever, and we might destroy an important part of the site,'' he said. The pasture _ near the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> north of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gainesville </ORGANIZATION> campus _ is where missionaries tended crops, celebrated Mass and tried to spread the gospel to six nearby Indian villages.

<TEXT>
 There's a pitcher at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a 200 mph fastball and a batter that can hit anything the pitcher tosses. Not on the baseball diamond. The battery is in the aerospace engineering department, where scientists have been busily researching baseball bats for the past year for three manufacturers, Worth, <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> and Spalding. `` Our purpose is to explore how different materials react with the ball,'' said Professor <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> designed and built most of the machines used to test the bats. They modified some others, like the 200-mph air cannon. <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> sets up most of the experiments and interprets the results, while <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> is responsible for the hardware. But mostly they play ball. `` We shoot the balls out of the air cannon at about 150 miles an hour and measure the ball speed. We can measure _ with computers _ the ball speed into the bat and away from the bat, the bat movement, the bat stresses and the direction the ball goes,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said. They use different materials for bats, such as aluminum, graphite, ceramic and wood, to test reactions. What have they learned? `` Well, some information is proprietary _ we do n't even share among companies,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said. `` But an example would be the big difference in how a ball comes off a bat when hit near the handle.'' Some balls travel farther or are harder to field when hit off a bat handle. However, when a ball strikes the same bat near the head, the ball does n't perform nearly so well. `` This knowledge would help the batter who crowds the plate,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said. `` He would like to know which bat performs well when he hits off the handle. That's something the bat manufacturers would like to know, too.''

<HEAD>Test Planned For `Star Wars' Particle Accelerator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists this spring plan to launch a particle beam accelerator on a 10-minute suborbital flight to help study whether devices that generate neutral particle beams might be useful in space-based weapons. Electrically charged particle beams would be bent by the Earth's magnetic field lines, but neutral beams should fly straight, according to scientists who have been working on such devices for anti-missile defense since 1975 The launch of a 40-foot Aries rocket from White Sands Missile Range carrying a 10-foot-long particle accelerator will be the first test in space by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> scientists. At altitudes above 75 miles, the accelerator will shoot 1,200 pencil-shaped bursts of hydrogen atoms toward the ground. The beams will cause the air along their paths to glow so they can be tracked through the night sky. However, the beams wo n't reach the ground. Below 75 miles, they collide with thicker air, become electrically charged and are deflected by the magnetic fields. Forty scientists, engineers and technicians have been working on the experiment, called Beam Experiment Aboard a Rocket, or BEAR. The team proved accelerators could be made small enough to be boosted by a rocket, at least for a low-energy experiment. The payload, including the accelerator, data-gathering devices and means of controlling the rocket's altitude, is 44 inches in diameter, less than 24 feet long, and weighs 1 -LCB- tons. Critics have said the technology is still immature, that a space-based accelerator would be vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons and that each one might require a billion watts of electrical power.

<HEAD>Team Testing New Laser Technique To Protect Infants At Birth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new technique that bounces laser light off brain cells to monitor the amount of oxygen reaching a fetus could help prevent brain damage and reduce the number of Caesarean sections, a researcher says. The technique has shown good results in tests on 12 patients at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gynecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, who heads the research team. `` Its main advantage is that its a gentle monitoring method which can give continuous readings without touching the fetus. `` We still have a long way to go before we make definite conclusions, but the preliminary results are very promising.'' The relatively cheap technique _ <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s model costs about $ 43,000 _ beams extremely low levels of harmless infrared light into the fetal brain. The light reflected back provides information about the supply of oxygen in brain cells; the information is displayed graphically on a desktop computer. `` It is extremely important to us to be able to gauge the level of oxygen in the tissue cells as often as possible,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. Earlier techniques required blood samples from the fetus, which `` has the disadvantage of being a single-point test and has to be repeated at short intervals. `` A continuous record is far more preferable and less cumbersome.'' In 20 out of 100 cases, he said, heart monitors indicate the possibility of oxygen deficiency, but only five of those 20 have symptoms that would actually require Caesarean delivery, he said. `` With our technique we hope to be able to determine which of those infants do not really require a caesarean section.'' Oxygen deficiency is the most common cause of death before, during and just after birth and is the main contributor to fetal brain damage, he said.

<HEAD>The Key Issues in the Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a look at the key issues in the battle between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAGES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Eastern is seeking $ 150 million in wage and benefit concessions to help stem mounting financial losses. Eastern's last offer called for a top hourly wage of $ 16 for mechanics and $ 11.54 for ramp service workers. Mechanics would get an extra 50 cents an hour in September 1993 under the proposed 4 -LCB- - year contract Eastern mechanics now earn a top wage of $ 18.83 an hour and ramp service workers $ 15.60 an hour. The Machinists want $ 50 million in raises, an 8 percent hike, but last week offered to delay increases for 15 months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENEFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Eastern wants to impose a five-year freeze on all pension benefit increases. Because its union pension funds are underfunded, a freeze would allow the airline to meet federal funding requirements. The Machinists want increases in all benefits.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONFLICT HISTORY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal talks began in October 1987. Eastern pilots and flight attendants a year earlier reached concessionary agreements that slashed pay by 20 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the dispute in January 1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massive layoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last month after Eastern rejected binding arbitration and the mediation board declared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike. More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized a strike. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to intervene to delay the strike. Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13 percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. The Machinists rejected it Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The airline says it has lost more than $ 1 billion this decade and is losing more than $ 1 million a day. It also has $ 2.5 billion in debt. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought Eastern in February 1986 and since then has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restore profitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunk to about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cut profitable routes, closed its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub and taken smaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on some flights. Eastern has about $ 400 million in cash to help it meet its financial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pending sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will bring in about $ 365 million.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LAYING THE BLAME</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands and says it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to make sacrifices. Labor maintains <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is suffering because it did n't react aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in 1978 In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for future profits that never materialized and stock. They do n't want further concessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-term commitment to its financial fitness.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SECONDARY EFFECTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The 1926 National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycotts, known as sympathy strikes, in air and rail travel. The Machinists on Sunday decided not to set up pickets that threatened to disrupt commuting in major cities after a federal judge barred rail workers from honoring picket lines in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. The Machinists planned to appeal. The nation's 12 commuter railroads and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> would be affected by any sympathy strikes. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is asking pilots nationwide to strictly follow aviation rules starting Tuesday in a job action that could delay every flight in the country.

 Media firms basked in limelight borrowed from the $ 18 billion merger planned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as investors _ apparently expecting further consolidations in the industry _ bid up stock in media companies. The biggest winner in Monday's trading was <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose shares soared $ 6 to close at $ 172.12 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gulf and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, rose $ 2.50 to close at $ 45.87 -LCB-, while <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.12 -LCB- to $ 77.62 -LCB- a share. Securities analysts said they expected more consolidations in the media business, although not as big as the deal announced Saturday to create <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest media concern in the world. `` It's a unique opportunity and I ca n't see that you're able to replicate it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said the new company would have projected annual revenues of $ 10 billion _ surpassing the current world communications leader, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bertelsmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, which reported $ 6 billion in 1987 revenue That is exactly what Time Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> had in mind as he and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> discussed a merger over the past two years. `` We believe that by the mid-1990s the media and entertainment industry will be composed of a limited number of global giants,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> told securities analysts last November. `` Time intends to be one of these companies.'' Who are the others? Mainly foreign publishing and broadcasting giants such <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and electronics behemoth <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, that have scooped up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible over the past several years by their own riches and the weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. In his speech to analysts, <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said the spurt of acquisitions, mergers and join ventures among media companies in recent years has given these businesses `` the sheer size required to compete efficiently on a global basis.'' For example, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said in an interview, his company's deal with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> would give <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> better access to foreign markets for its video business. He predicted the greatest impact of the deal would come in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> overseas operations. Analysts said they expected foreigners to continue buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> _ which bought <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> last year _ has expressed interest in owning a motion picture company, including <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bertelsmann </ORGANIZATION> is not as well known in this country as some other big media names, such as <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, but it owns the publisher <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and RCA records. <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> suggested <ORGANIZATION> Bertelsmann </ORGANIZATION> might also move into the film business. <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> owns newspaper, magazine and book publishing operations in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His American holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Row </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has no plans to slow down although <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had $ 4.3 billion in 1988 revenue, has become burdened by debt because of its many acquisitions. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> also plans to raise $ 1 billion or more for buying other communications companies around the world. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had $ 2.6 billion in revenue in 1987. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> _ motivated partly by a rivalry with <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> _ wants to see that figure swell to $ 5 billion to $ 9 billion, and he has said he intends to keep acquiring businesses until he reaches that goal. Last year he won a long battle for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and also agreed to buy <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Official Airline Guides. American companies expect to join the consolidation. <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western and <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> are candidates for consolidations among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms.

<HEAD>Philippine Economy Showing Signs Of Revival After Years Of Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of decline, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> economy shows signs of revival, and business leaders hope that the modest boom heralds desperately needed stability for President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. Serious problems still face the Aquino administration, including a burgeoning population, environmental destruction and the fact that millions of Filipinos have not yet benefited economically from the turnaround. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which had been East Asia's second-most-developed nation after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, now lags far behind other non-Communist Southeast Asian economies after 20 years of misrule under ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Government figures show that more than 60 percent of the 58 million Filipinos live below the poverty line. Millions still leave each year in search of employment abroad. Nonetheless, the economy has grown during each year since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took power in the February 1986 uprising against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Her rise to power followed two straight years of negative growth and soaring inflation. Throughout the capital, construction projects have resumed, and department stores are jammed with shoppers on weekends and holidays. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> abolished the ruinous state monopolies on sugar and coconut export, which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates used to corner those markets, and moved slowly to remove government from private business. Last year, the gross national product grew by 6.7 percent, while inflation remained under 9 percent. According to government figures, unemployment fell from 11.2 percent in 1987 to 9.6 percent, due mostly to a boom in construction that absorbed out-of-work farmers. Agriculture, which provides the livelihood of about 65 percent of Filipinos, grew 3.4 percent despite several destructive typhoons. Economists say most of the economic growth is due to consumer spending _ up 5.1 percent in 1988 _ thanks in large measure to a relaxation of import restrictions and a drop in world petroleum prices. But the favorable figures have led to renewed optimism within the foreign and Filipino business community that the country may at last be on the road to recovery. `` In sharp contrast to the wait-and-see attitude so prevalent just two years ago, businessmen, entrepreneurs and consumers took positive and decisive steps to keep the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> economic recovery on the right track,'' said the influential <ORGANIZATION> Makati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in a report. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 1.47 billion worth of investment projects, up 216 percent over the previous year. About 22 percent of the total came from foreign investors. Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> inaugurated a new auto manufacturing plant in suburban <LOCATION> Paranaque </LOCATION> that will be half-owned by Filipinos. Trade Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> said total exports last year reached $ 7.07 billion. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> broke through that barrier 12 years ago, but nevertheless the figure represented a 24 percent increase in Philippine exports over the previous year. The boom has not been limited to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, which traditionally outpaces the rest of the island nation. Last year, the economy in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and surrounding islands grew by 7.5 percent. In <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, exports of wood and processed foods topped $ 450 million last year. Construction in the southern city tripled from 1987 levels and banks reported a 35 percent increase in business loans. Western diplomats and Filipino commentators believe political stability has been the key to the economic rebound. After a series of failed coups in 1986 and 1987, including the abortive putsch on Aug. 28, 1987, that killed 53 people, there were no serious, armed attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> last year. Rumors of new, right-wing conspiracies periodically sweep <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. But there has been a growing sense here that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will finish her term in 1992. A dramatic upsurge in street killings by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels in the capital tapered off last year because of a police crackdown and a public backlash to the carnage. In addition, the wave of strikes which swept <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> and other industrial areas in the months after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' downfall declined sharply. In October 1987, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on illegal strikes. Barricades that blocked pedestrian and vehicle traffic were torn down and strike leaders were frequently arrested. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, those measures reduced the number of strikes from 484 in 1987 to 296 last year. Government figures show production time lost because of strikes fell by 20 percent in 1988 over the previous year.

<HEAD>Students Like Controversial New TV Program, Commercials And All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The controversy over beaming a commercially sponsored television news show for teen-agers into classrooms does n't seem to bother the students and teachers who watched Channel One's debut at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The students said they liked the idea of seeing the news, something a few of them conceded they do n't watch enough of at home, and enjoyed the features, such as a look at the life of Soviet teens. Teacher <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s only complaint was that the show was `` a litte fast,'' although the pace did n't seem to bother her students. She said those complaining about the commercials are mistaken. `` We ca n't get something for nothing,'' she said. The first show in a test run of the project included paid pitches for <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s 501 jeans, Snickers candy bars and Head & amp; Shoulders shampoo. The program premiered in five high schools Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, the Knoxville-based media concern that produced the program, plans to sell up to two miutes of commercial time on each 12-minute show to pay for the hardware it is giving schools to show it. Ad time already has been sold on the remaining 24 shows in the test for products such as breath mints, acne medications, snack chips, and cosmetics. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has bought time in four product categories to see if the program is `` a viable vehicle'' for reaching teen-agers, while helping helping schools provide a topical educational program, said <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman. The presence of paid advertising on the show has enraged some education groups, who say Big Business should be barred from making sales pitches to students in the classroom. But Central High students said the ads did not bother them. `` It's fine with me,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON>, a 14-year-old freshman. `` You get more pressure from other students than you do from the commercials.'' <PERSON> Toi </PERSON> <PERSON> McCane </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior, said the commercials `` are just the same thing you get on the news at night.'' The show also debuted Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gahr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Billerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The sixth test site, <ORGANIZATION> Withrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, was closed by bad weather Monday, but was expected to join the test today. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> has years of experience in producing ad-filled magazines and posters aimed at the student market. But this is the company's first venture into television. Groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION> have opposed it. `` They are trying to make it a part of every school day, and this medium has a much stronger impact than any other,'' said <PERSON> Tari </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the National PTA. But Whittle chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said that schools could simply not afford the equipment and the level of programming that he is providing. The six test schools each were given about $ 50,000 in television monitors, video recording equipment and a satellite dish to receive the daily news show. They will keep the gear no matter how the test goes. If the test proves successful, Whittle hopes to expand it nationally to as many as 8,000 schools in the fall of 1990. In exchange for the equipment, which may be used for other purposes, the schools agree to run the news show each school day. The first show started off with some flashy graphics, and then two youthful anchors read news headlines. The news coverage included segments on Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s troubled nomination as defense secretary, the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike and threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, as well as a piece on the controversy over the new show. An anti-drug ad was run as a public service. In <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>'s senior home room class at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>, all 20 students appeared to watch the show closely, figeting only for a commercial. At the <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, more than 700 students watched the inaugural program, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinskas </PERSON> said. `` So far, most of the reaction seems to be positive,'' he said. <PERSON> Jasinskas </PERSON> said the program may help improve students' knowledge of world events. As far as the commercials, he said he thought the school would be able to help the students be more analytical in their approach to them. Whittle gave the first show high marks for ontent, but said some work remains to be done on the pacing of the broadcast. He also said his anchors ought to `` loosen up a bit.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> released statistical reports Monday on the performance of major airlines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The reports, some covering only the largest carriers and others including smaller ones, concern such areas as on-time performance, consumer complaints, baggage problems and chronically late flights. The reports are based on information provided by the airlines and do not include delays caused by mechanical problems. The reports included:

 Complaints of lost and mishandled baggage received by airlines in January, shown as the number of complaints per 1,000 passengers on the airline. Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of reporting. For example, some airlines count in their complaint data courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other airlines find lost baggage. In addition, reporting methods vary for problems with carry-on baggage and late arriving passengers.

 Share prices bounced back on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today after a plunge in early trading, while the dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 9.63 points Monday, rose 61.08 points, or 0.19 percent, today to close at 31,937.94. After a drop in early trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> started upward at midmorning. The index's early decline followed news that <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company, and his former secretary were arrested Monday on bribery charges in connection with a major stock scandal involving top politicians, dealers said. `` But the Nikkei started to recover from its setback following Finance Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON>'s comment that the yen's weak performance had nothing to do with the stock scandal,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told reporters today that the yen's decline `` did not have anything to do -LRB- with Shinto's arrest -RRB- ... It's a market after all, and who knows why it moves.'' <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said investors' interest in steel and construction issues contributed to the index's rise. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares. In currency dealings, the dollar finished at 129.03 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's 127.63-yen close. The currency started opened at 129.25 yen and ranged between 128.87 yen and 129.28 yen. After gaining 2.12 yen over four days last week, the dollar had declined by 0.49 yen on Monday. Dealers attributed the dollar's higher opening in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today to its gains on overseas markets overnight. But the rate did not move much once trading started in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Hardly anybody was participating in the afternoon session after failing to lead the market anywhere, because buying and selling were equally mixed,'' she said.

 The dollar rose against all major currencies except the British pound and Japanese yen in cautious European trading today. Gold prices also were higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Dealers said the dollar, which slipped back in profit-taking from early highs, had been buoyed by a drop in West German money market rates and by a Japanese official's remark that the dollar had bottomed out. The dollar has been gaining against the West German mark since the West German central bank, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, decided last week against raising interest rates, dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.40 Japanese yen to a closing 129.03 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it edged down to 128.85 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from 1.8531; 1.5865 Swiss francs, up from 1.5830; 6.3080 French francs, up from 6.2955; 2.0965 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,363.50 Italian lire, up from 1,359.25; 1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1928 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound opened lower against the dollar, then rose to $ 1.7215 from $ 1.7210 late Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 386.90 a troy ounce, up from the $ 386.25 bid late Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 386.30 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the noon bid price was $ 386.40, up from the $ 386.30 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.26 to close at a bid of $ 388.21. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid price of $ 5.80 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.81 late Monday.

<HEAD>Some Repossessed Real Estate May be Used for Social Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering ways to ease concerns in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that its savings and loan plan would permit regulators to dump billions of dollars of repossessed real estate onto fragile <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> markets, according to an industry official. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that `` an element of the administration'' is examining proposals to combine federal and state money to pay for a real estate maintenance program. As part of the program, some of the real estate could be used for day care centers, food programs or in some other way that meets President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kinder, gentler'' social objectives, he said. `` Thought is being given to it, very, very high level thought,'' <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said. In other S & amp; L developments, Monday: _ Rep <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, introduced the administration's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. It was referred to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' committee, defusing a jurisdictional dispute between the banking panel and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that could have delayed congressional action. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION>, had sought joint jurisdiction, arguing that a key element of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan provided for selling $ 50 billion in government bonds and that his panel's turf covered revenue raising _ Six Washington-based think tanks _ ranging from the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> _ issued a statement saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal does n't provide enough money or reform <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and other legislators from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are worried that if regulators try to sell off repossessed real estate too fast, it could collapse the already weak real estate market in the state. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the commercial bank regulator which under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s restructuring plan also would take the lead in resolving S & amp; L problems, has historically sold repossessed property faster than S & amp; L regulators. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> described the possible addition of a property management program to the administration plan as a contingency rather than a Bush initiative. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> moves in this direction, they have to be prepared,'' he said. An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration wants to preserve regulators' discretion to judge the best time to sell. `` I do n't think anyone anticipates that real estate would be dumped,'' the official said. `` But we would prefer the flexibility to sell as market conditions dictate and permit. That's the best way to protect the taxpayers' interest as well as that of local markets.'' Two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republicans _ Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, both members of the banking committees _ said in telephone interviews they agreed it would be unwise to dictate when or how regulators can sell property. Both expressed confidence that <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> would not sell at below-market prices. In a speech last week, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, `` If we ca n't obtain today's fair price, we'll hold on. But he warned that withholding sale of property for too long would create an `` overhang'' on the real estate market and hurt local economies. The six groups offering a critique of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan were the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Competitive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. They said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to raise $ 50 billion for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls over three years does not provide money fast enough. They said the government should spend $ 50 billion by the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept. 30 and then decide how much more it needs. The groups urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fight industry attempts to weaken the stricter capital standards of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan and advised it to add the following reforms: market-based accounting, risk-based deposit insurance premiums and limits on deposit insurance. It said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not attempt to turn back the clock by restricting S & amp; Ls mostly to home mortgage lending.

<HEAD>FAA Says Security Up, But Fines Still Top $1 Million In Weapons Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aviation security has improved, but federal agents still managed to slip 156 weapons through airport security resulting in $ 1.18 million in fines against domestic airlines, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced. The agency said the detection rate for all airlines checked was 93.1 percent, compared to 88.2 percent in July 1988 and 78.9 percent in the first such tests of the system in 1987. In a separate <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Monday, airlines showed improvements in the number of flight delays, baggage problems and passengers with reservations who were `` bumped'' off flights. Fines against airlines in the weapons tests resulted when airport security failed to detect fake guns, knives, explosives or other weapons in hand-carried luggage or in the clothing of federal agents. The largest fines were $ 186,000 against <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for 24 alleged violations, $ 151,000 against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for 20, $ 136,000 against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> for 18 and $ 132,000 against <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> for 15. Other fines ranged from $ 1,000 for single violations to $ 92,000. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fines for security lapses have totalled nearly $ 4 million since the program began two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. About 50 airlines have been cited for 557 detection failures. The agency said it ran more than 6,800 checks of airline security systems during 1988. It said the latest fines resulted from incidents over the past year. Under <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules, airlines are responsible for screening passengers and their carry-on luggage. At airports where security is contracted by several airlines, each carrier is held responsible for any failure. In a monthly report by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the 13 largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers reported that 76.7 percent of their flights operated on time in January, compared with 76.1 percent in December 1988 and 69.2 percent in January 1988. Delays caused by mechanical problems are not counted in the monthly air consumer survey. Mishandled baggage reports filed against the airlines in January declined from an average of 8.58 per 1,000 passengers in December to 7.86 in January. The airlines also reported that in 1988 the number of passengers denied seats for which they had reservations was 2.97 per 100,000. In 1987, airlines reported 3.99 passengers per 100,000 were `` bumped.'' Consumer complaints were up slightly in February, however, to 1,138, compared to 1,086 in January, the department said, adding that this is a 51 percent decline from February 1988 when complaints reached 2,308.

 Although organized labor says it did not pick the fight, the nation's unions are looking to how the government handles the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike as the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> for workers' rights in the 1990s Not since former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired 11,000 federal air traffic controllers in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in a strike been greater. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s action emboldened employers in the recession years of 1981 and 1982 to demand wage concessions from workers and get them. Automatic inflation-indexed, cost-of-living adjustments that were a fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many settlements in the'80s. Steel, auto and rubber workers counting on $ 15 to $ 21 hourly wages took wage cuts, as did meatpackers and airline workers paid half as much. Those who balked _ copper miners in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, meatpackers in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or pilots and machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> acquired it _ found themselves on the street, replaced by non-union workers often willing to work for half as much. The return of national economic prosperity after the recession did not reverse the trend. But through it all, two groups of union workers were able to preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to inflation: teachers and other state, county and municipal employees, and railroad workers. The first group did it through a recognition that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> educational standards were falling, by using public sector collective bargaining laws enacted under President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services. Rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 National Railway Labor Act, a law governing labor relations in both railroads and airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through government intervention and maintain transportation vital to interstate commerce. Now, however, the labor movement is looking to the railway labor law it once vigorously opposed to lead it out of a decade in which it lost more than a fourth of its members. Recent uses of the law have raised those union hopes. The president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have broad powers under the railway labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions through Presidential Emergency Boards. They lack those powers in other sectors of the economy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the mechanism several times, blocking threatened railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for concessions. And although the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act forbids striking union members at one company from picketing another company, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at railroads and airlines. Unions are counting on that combination to defeat <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, its principal owner, whom <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> on Monday called the `` Typhoid <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of union busters in the transportation industry.'' It was <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> who acquired <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and then declared bankruptcy two years later _ a move that allowed him to cancel all of the company's union contracts. Eventually all of the union workers were replaced. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> later upheld <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s right to abrogate <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes, creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be followed by any company. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spearheaded legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 changing the law, but ever since then <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been at the top of the labor organization's enemies list. Bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debt-financed leveraged buyouts exemplified by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labor's legislative agenda. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> acknowledged the `` broad implications'' if Eastern succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by $ 4,000 a year and its ramp workers by $ 8,000 annually as demanded in the company's last offer before the strike Saturday. `` There are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management and certain circles in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who want to see his tactics succeed,'' he said Monday. `` This company is not in trouble because of the wages it pays _ labor costs at Eastern are lower than other airlines operating profitably and efficiently.'' `` This company is in trouble because it's in hock to the banks some $ 2.5 billion,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` The interest cost on that debt ... in excess of $ 800,000 a day ... is virtually equal to the amount this company is losing. `` This is not an atypical situation in American industry with the vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that have been saddled on otherwise good companies.''

<HEAD>A Sinister Motive In ``Taste Treats'' For Fish</HEAD>

 For a fish, getting to spend time in one of <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' aquariums must be about as good as can be. There, in complete safety, a fish gets first-class accommodations for several weeks, his only chore being to perform taste tests for a fellow who appreciates fish. `` It's like taking them to Baskin-Robbins,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` We ask them to tell us which samples they do n't like, which ones they like and which ones they really like. There's no stress, we keep them well fed and the water clean. They do n't live a bad life.'' There's a sinister motive, though, from a fish's point of view. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is a fish biologist for <ORGANIZATION> Berkley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spirit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, which makes fishing lures. His job is to isolate the chemicals that fish identify as food, and then make them into lures. `` I'm somewhat of a unique species,'' he said. `` I do n't know of a single other fishing lure company that has a fish biologist on staff.'' He also has discovered that fish do not necessarily like a repugnant bait. `` There's a mistaken impression that the stinkier the bait, the better. That's a gross error. That's not how it works. The chemicals that catfish rely on as a signal for food has nothing to do with how stinky it is,'' he said. Some stinky baits, like old cheese, do contain elements that are quite appetizing for catfish, `` but it does n't contain very much of them, and the part that does is probably not the stinky part.'' The fish tests are simple. `` You take little cotton pellets, the same as you would find in a dentist's office. By themselves, they're neutral. Fish neither like them nor dislike them. `` If you put one in water, a rainbow trout might attack it. Once inside the mouth, the next thing that happens depends on what the fish perceives it to be. If he's neutral towards it or does n't like it, he spits it out in a split second. If he likes it, he might mull it over, chew it up and then spit it out. The ones they really like, they'll go ahead and swallow. `` The cotton does n't hurt the fish. It's just like a high fiber diet.'' He said he has isolated some tasty chemicals for several species. The substances are marketed either in a liquid that is dropped on the lure or as a putty-like glob that becomes the lure itself. There is still years of work, however, to identify all of the chemicals that fish interpret to be food, but theoretically, the perfect lure would put the beginning fisherman on the same plateau with the pro. `` We have n't quite reached that level yet,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We have a standard joke around here, if you want to improve the fish's odds, try fishing with one arm tied behind your back, or use a barbless hook.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to intervene in an acid rain dispute between the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> leaves the problem of interstate air pollution up to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For nearly a decade, a group of northeastern states has waged a legal campaign to try to get the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to crack down on industrial polluters as far away as <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, claiming pollution from those states is ruining their lakes and forests. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided against considering the case. It let stand a federal appeals court decision agreeing with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> that the states had not shown that their pollution problems stemmed from emissions hundreds of miles away. But some environmentalists and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials suggested Monday that the legal fight may no longer have the importance it once had, anyway. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected this year to enact new federal legislation specifically addressing acid rain pollution. Environmentalists hope the legislation will curb emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxide from coal-burning power plants and factories. These pollutants often travel hundreds of miles and fall to the ground as highly acidic rain destroying freshwater life and forest vegetation in areas where the air otherwise is considered largely free of pollution. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states have been among those complaining about acid rain caused by the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In the early 1980s, petitions to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> claimed that soot, smoke and sulfur dioxide were blowing from the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and making it impossible for them to meet federally required air pollution requirements. They cited pollutants from coal-burning utility plants and factories in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> argued that the complaining states were responsible for maintaining their own air quality and that they had not produced sufficient evidence that the pollution stemmed from smokestakes in the states cited. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also argued that federal law is not specifically designed to cover such long-range pollution. Last July a federal appeals court agreed and, deferring to the agency's expertise, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s position was reasonable. Although <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> did not pursue the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were joined in the petition before the high court by <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. The case has never specifically cited acid rain because there is no federal acid rain legislation. Instead it has focused on the amount of certain pollutants that were found in the air. According to a national acid rain assessment program, the industrial belt stretching from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> accounts for high emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxide. Federal clean air legislation enacted in 1970 directed that industrial and utility smokestakes be heightened, a requirement which improved air quality near such plants, but sent the emissions higher into the air where they traveled farther. Scientists believe that about two-thirds of the sulfur dioxide emissions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> come from coal-burning electric power plants and another 11 percent from industrial fuel combustion. Nearly half of all nitrogen oxides are believe to come from electric power plant and industrial fuel combustion, while nearly 38 percent comes from transportation.

<HEAD>Nature, Policy Both Helped Cut Grain Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No doubt that last year's yield-shriveling drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had much to do with the sharp decline in world grain supplies, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic farm policy also played an important role. <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said last summer's drought `` abruptly changed the world grain situation'' after a decade of surplus and low prices to a period of tight supplies and rising prices. `` Part of the drop in world stocks over the last two years was intentional,'' he said. `` Production consistently exceeded consumption through most of the 1980s. Two years ago, world and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks reached a record, both in total and in relation to use. A major concern at that time was to balance supply and use by stimulating consumption and discouraging production.'' As part of the answer, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took large amounts of cropland from production. Wheat farmers, for example, had to idle 27.5 percent of their base acreage for both the 1987 and 1988 crops in order to qualify for government supports. Larger reductions also applied to corn and other `` coarse'' grains. The Conservation Reserve Program, aimed at idling up to 45 million acres of fragile cropland by the end of 1990, also took huge bites. Mainly as a result of these government actions and lower prices, there was a 14 percent drop in the acreage planted to wheat and coarse grains between 1986 and 1988, <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> said in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` At the same time, low world prices discouraged production in other exporting countries, particularly <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` So competitor production also leveled off, and foreign stocks, which were near a record at the end of 1986-87, began to drop during 1987-88.'' <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> said that at this point there was `` an additional and dramatic role'' by the weather. `` In 1987, a poor monsoon in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> sharply lowered world rice stocks,'' he said. `` Record drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1988 was responsible for a sharp drawdown of wheat and coarse grain stocks.'' But <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> added: `` There were no serious crop setbacks in most of the rest of the world; foreign grain consumption increased despite tighter exporter supplies.'' World grain stocks at the end of the 1988-89 season are expected to be down 30 percent from a year ago to 279 million metric tons, the lowest in more than a decade. Most of the decline is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which held an average of 34 percent of the world's total between 1977 and 1987 Just two years ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' grain inventory was a record 204 million tons, or 45 percent of the world's total. By the end of this year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will hold only 74 million tons, or 27 percent of the total. Foreign stocks are down, too, but their decline has been much smaller. <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> said the current situation in some ways is similar to 1972-73. But that was when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> came into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in a big way, and the drop in stockpiles was due to exports, not production shortfalls. `` The dramatic growth of consumption and depletion of world stocks -LRB- in the early 1970s -RRB- created widespread pessimism about the world's ability to feed itself,'' he said. `` Projections of long-term chronic shortages and higher prices became common.'' But grain production surged back, inventories grew again, and real prices `` resumed their long-term decline,'' <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> said. Attention then returned to the excess capacity of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world agriculture. <PERSON> Surls </PERSON> said it is too early to say a great deal about world crop prospects for 1989-90, but he offered some points to consider: _ The best estimate of world grain yields in 1989-90 is for them to be near the historical trend or close to it, although `` based on weather to date, North American winter wheat yield potential may be reduced. _ Substantial excess production capacity will be brought back into use this year In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, acreage reduction requirements for both wheat and coarse grains have been lowered to 10 percent, and plantings will be up. Overseas, acreage probably will rise in response to higher world market prices. _ Production is likely to rise substantially While the increase may stop the drawing down of world grain inventories, the actual rebuilding of stockpiles probably will be small because consumption will be close to production. _ The rebuilding of world grain stocks probably will stretch over several years Even with yields back on track, the world's grain supply-demand situation will keep prices up relative to those of the mid-1980s. _ If the world experiences short crops this year, particularly for wheat, there will be only limited reserves A significant shortfall would mean sharply higher prices and reduced world consumption. `` Finally, the longer-run concerns of some observers about slowing growth in food production are not likely to be important for 1989-90,'' he said. `` As recently as two years ago, the world situation was one of excess capacity. The underlying longrun tendency is still for production to exceed consumption unless real prices fall.''

<HEAD>Signup Period Set for Conservation Reserve Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers will have another opportunity this summer to put highly erodible land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program, says Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Monday the ninth CRP signup period will be July 17 through Aug. 4 and that farmers who want to offer land under the program should contact local offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are accepted receive annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance to pay half the cost of planting trees, shrubs and grass to guard against erosion. The eighth round of applications was completed on Feb. 24, but <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the final results will not be ready until June. Meanwhile, he said, the `` maximum acceptable rental rates'' for land offered by farmers will be the same as in the seventh signup. Those are the maximum payments under the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> for land put into the program. The rates vary by state and often within single states themselves, from a maximum of $ 30 per acre annually for less-productive land to as much as $ 115 per acre each year for better land. A total of 28.2 million acres was accepted into <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> through the first seven signups, with the annual payment averaging around $ 49 per acre. The goal of the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> as set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law is to have 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland taken from production by the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Aerospace Workers Blame Chemical Exposure for Ailments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One former aerospace worker says she got lost driving on a road she used every day. Another ca n't always remember her children's ages. And a third likens her mood swings to a `` roller coaster, up and down.'' The aerospace employees all told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Monday they suffered chronic physical and mental illness from exposure to hazardous chemicals. An official for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which employed two of the workers, said the company was concerned for the safety of employees exposed to hazardous chemicals, but the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on toxic substances, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, rebuked the aerospace company. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Democrat said he felt <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was `` minimizing'' the effects that hazardous materials can have on workers by pleading ignorance to the danger and emphasizing disagreements in the medical community. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for human resources, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON>, told the subcommittee there was no evidence to link an acidic resin formerly used by the company with workers' health problems. <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON> said the company nonetheless, out of concern for workers' health, discontinued use of the material even though it was `` determined that the material presented no significant health hazard.'' <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> `` not only met, but significantly exceeded'' regulatory standards, and testified that the medical community was divided. `` The fact that we believed the material was safe became irrelevant,'' said <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON>. `` In the highly charged atmosphere that existed, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concerns was to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.'' One witness, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes-Sutherland </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she began working 16 years ago for J.S. <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON>, a company that distributes aerospace chemicals. Telling the panel she almost died a year ago, Ms. <PERSON> Forbes-Sutherland </PERSON> said that when asked by customers if the chemicals were safe, she unwittingly told them, `` Yes, if you do n't eat them on your breakfast cereal. I lied to those people.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said chemical exposure caused her co-workers to pass out, vomit, act as if they were drunk at work and feel like `` their head was going to explode.'' `` We were discouraged from reporting this'' to the company medical department, she testified, and said workers were threatened with dismissal after complaining. `` You either worked with these chemicals or you did not have a job,'' she said. `` I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' she testified. `` I ca n't pump gas. I ca n't go to the grocery store without getting sick. I ca n't sleep at night, I ca n't eat, I have no energy. I do n't know my kids, I do n't know their ages. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said she became disoriented from exposure to chemicals at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, and once got lost while `` driving down a highway I drove every day.'' <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberty </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who appeared at the hearing wearing gloves, said she was `` poisoned'' by chemicals while working at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and has been unable to work for two years. Ms. <PERSON> Liberty </PERSON>, 33, said she has suffered from severe headaches, impaired speech, bleeding fingers, nails that fall off, and moods that were `` like a roller coaster, up and down.'' Afraid to have children because she's worried about birth defects, Ms. <PERSON> Liberty </PERSON> told senators she takes 14 to 20 tablets daily for her various ailments, including medicine for depression, and sees specialists ranging from psychiatrists to a toxicologist. `` I do n't think I can ever go back to the job I enjoyed,'' she said, blaming the company for improper ventilation, failure to warn workers of dangers, a lack of protective devices, and using her as a `` guinea pig'' to try out new chemicals while tubes were attached to her to measure exposure. She contended the company threatened to fire her when she complained. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company `` recognizes that raw materials and processes in the workplace pose potential health threats.'' However, he added, `` When employees are properly trained and utilize the proper protective equipment, together with adequate engineering controls, the employees can work safely.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been fined $ 5.5 million for double-billing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and the punishment will serve as a warning to other defense contractors, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> says. `` We're quite pleased, and we hope that a fine of that magnitude will send out a message to the defense industry that the federal courts are taking defense procurement fraud very seriously,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on Monday fined the aerospace giant for overbilling the Pentagon for a navigation satellite system. The judge also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> to pay restitution of $ 446,248 and placed the company on probation for five years. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> had pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of court but maintained that two high-level employees, not the company, were responsible for the overcharges and a subsequent coverup. The company said it would appeal the fine. The El Segundo-based company was fined for conspiring with some of its managers to overbill the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> by nearly $ 500,000 on the $ 1.2 billion NAVSTAR navigation satellite system between 1982 and 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement reiterating its contention that the overbilling was the responsibility of renegade employees acting in what they perceived to be the company's benefit. `` <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> was sentenced today because of our responsibility under the law for the acts of our employees,'' it said. `` We accept that responsibility but we continue to believe that the company itself should not have been indicted.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> manager, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavodnik </PERSON>, 47, has pleaded guilty to lying to the government and conspiracy in the case. He was sentenced last month to a year of probation. His supervisor, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 60, was acquitted of the charges by a federal jury. The largest fine imposed on a defense contractor was $ 115 million in 1988 against <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, manufacturer of electronic, mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft, was fined for its guilty plea to four counts of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by overbilling on aircraft parts. The company admitted it had billed the department for things like babysitting, country clubs and servants for its executives.

 Biologist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Masteller </PERSON> leaned into a razor-sharp wind and struggled through crusted snow in search of yellow patches that one day may allow scientists to predict nutritional problems in wildlife. Caribou scramble to escape the helicopter ferrying <PERSON> Masteller </PERSON> and wildlife technician <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> onto the frozen tundra in this remote section of Denali National Park. Casting this way and that, <PERSON> Masteller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> checked urine-stained snow that may have been left by the fleeing animals. `` That's too old, I think,'' said <PERSON> Masteller </PERSON>. `` That, too. Here's a good one. He dropped to his knees, pulled out a stainless steel spoon and began stuffing freshly soiled snow into a plastic bag. The two are gathering material for a predator-prey study conducted by <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mech </PERSON>, a wolf researcher, and <PERSON> Layne </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist. The work is aimed at finding some way for researchers to determine the condition of wildlife by measuring the ratio of chemicals normally found in urine, urea nitrogen and creatinine. Increased urea nitrogen would indicate the animal was metabolizing more protein, either from food or from its own muscle mass. For large hoofed animals in winter, metabolic rates decrease and food intake is reduced. Ever-increasing amounts of urea nitrogen in the urine indicate the animal may be in trouble. Using hand signals to direct the helicopter pilot, <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> listens to electronic beeps picked up by antenna to zero in on randomly selected radio-collared caribou. Mostly, the biologists seek out cows. Bulls are too depleted by the rut before winter to give valid samples later. `` Once they deplete their fat reserves, then they start metabolizing protein at a more extensive rate,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist specializing in nutrition and physiology. `` Because they start burning up their body protein, you start seeing high levels of urea nitrogen in the urine _ almost like they become meat-eaters; almost like wolves.'' <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> and biochemist <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON>, both of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> research center in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, are running the study of frozen urine from <ORGANIZATION> Denali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, home of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>. `` We're in the early phases of the research; we would like to get it more quantifiable,'' <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> said. `` One of the things that this will allow increasingly in the future is some forecasting ability for wildlife managers. We've got a ways to go, but it's looking very, very promising `` I think it's going to enable us to detect subtle changes before gross deterioration occurs,'' he said. For <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and other states with free-roaming herds of wildlife, the research could have far-reaching effects, and `` there is no reason it wo n't apply to every large herbivore,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` Practically applied, it would allow for comparisons between herds and track trends of animals' condition over time,'' he said. `` If you can determine changes in winter physical condition, conceivably you could track that and it would allow you to adjust management strategies.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has come up with enough government money to keep the Landsat earth-watching satellites operating at least until a review of the program can be completed, his spokesman says. The earth-sensing satellites were due to be turned off March 31, when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would run out of money to keep them going. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> needed $ 9.4 million to operate the satellites until the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. But emergency funding will come from departments that use Landsat images _ State, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> _ as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. Landsats scan the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> with seven kinds of instruments, giving detailed images of the land and vegetation. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said a review is being made of the satellite system. `` The plug wo n't be pulled before the review is completed,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. `` The review will be completed prior to -LRB- congressional -RRB- oversight of the FY 1990 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> budget.'' A House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee was conducting a hearing this afternoon on the Landsat. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which studies the national space programs. <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said he did not know how much money would be necessary to keep the system operating until the end of the fiscal year, but `` it could be less -LRB- than $ 9.4 million -RRB- if we can implement some cost economies.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposed no money for the current and future fiscal years, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restored enough to keep the satellites operating until the end of the month. The <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, known as EOSAT, currently operates two satellites, <ORGANIZATION> Landsats </ORGANIZATION> 4 and 5, which provide photos for mineral exploration, checking soil conditions and vegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes and tracing ocean currents. Both satellites are well past their expected lifetimes and are not fully operational, but they are providing useful information. An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction. That project will continue because money was provided to complete and launch that satellite.

It should never have started,'' <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> said Monday. `` I think my honesty ranks with that of any officer who has ever served a bank in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. I am guilty of mistakes in judgement, but I am not guilty of dishonesty.'' An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the opinion overturning its ban on <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> would hinder efforts to clean up abuses in banking. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in January 1988 removed <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> from his position as officer and director of the Detroit-area bank-holding company and forbade him from engaging in future banking activities. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, however, had resigned in July 1984 from his position as the head of the bank his father founded. He left the banking company nearly a year before the comptroller of the currency began proceedings to remove him in an investigation of misuse of bank funds. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, in an opinion issued Friday, vacated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s order, saying the board's decision to dismiss <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> after his resignation `` presents a linguistic _ and metaphysical _ impossibility.'' `` One can not remove what is n't there,'' said the opinion written by Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> attorney, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, said from an enforcement standpoint, `` it creates a certain problem when someone can resign and therefore elude jurisdiction.'' The board had argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the removal provision as a way of barring people who engaged in misconduct from returning to the banking business. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, said his client `` seriously wants to get back into the banking business.'' `` In the current climate of troubled institutions all over the country, someone of his enormous experience and talents would be quite useful to any number of institutions,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. The comptroller of the currency, in recommending action against <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, said the bank officer used $ 167,385 of the institution's funds for improper purposes The agency said <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> used the money for renovation of buildings that were or were to become Mormon churches; improvements to his residence, vacation home and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> condominium; payment of bills for a wedding reception for his children and friends; and extensive personal secretarial and errand services.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said today that all countries, including poor Third World nations, must curb ozone-destroying chemicals that she said threaten life on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` Simply to carry on as we are is not an option,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the end of a 120-nation conference on phasing out the use of chlorofluorocarbons. The chemical compounds are used in aerosol products, refrigerators and air conditioners. Her speech came after <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> on Monday called for a complete ban by century's end of the synthetic chemicals. The meeting began Sunday and 20 countries have since joined the 31 that signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol requiring that production of the compounds chemicals be cut in half by the turn of the century. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> acknowledged that action on the compounds was likely to begin in industrial nations. However, she added, `` It is not a case of some countries asking other countries to act. It is a case of every country taking action.'' She said the world's people must `` change their customs and habits in what they buy and what they do'' in order to `` overcome one of the greatest challenges to life on Earth.'' The compounds are stable and non-toxic when released into the atmosphere, but when they rise 15-25 miles to the stratosphere, 10 to 100 years later, they break apart and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays The compounds also trap heat and warm global temperatures, causing potentially major climate changes in a process known as the greenhouse effect. In other remarks today, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told reporters: `` I think we are all in this together. We are all going to have to find ways to collaborate and clear this mess up. It affects us all.'' Delegates from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Monday urged the industrial nations to create a fund to help developing nations replace the compounds with safe substitutes. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet delegation, told the conference Monday that his country needs more scientific evidence that CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it will agree to speed up its phaseout of such chemicals. `` If we take a decision which is not well-grounded, we can interfere and destroy the economies of the developing countries,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have said they will press for a total ban on the compounds by the end of the century. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said Monday that, `` There is surely an overwhelming scientific case to change the -LRB- <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> -RRB- treaty from a reduction to complete elimination.'' The heir to the British throne, who banned aerosols with the compounds from his households last year, urged a consumer boycott of products containing the chemicals.

<HEAD>Apple Unveils Macintosh IIcx And New Monitors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hoping to get back on track after recent pricing blunders and a projected drop in earnings this quarter, is unveiling a more compact but equally powerful Macintosh computer and two large, extra-sharp monitors. The Macintosh IIcx was scheduled to make its debut today in a glitzy teleconference broadcast from a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hotel to customers, resellers, reporters and analysts in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hannover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Macintosh IIcx, the third member of the Macintosh family announced in the last six months, features the <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> 68030 and 68882 microprocessors, takes up less desk space than the earlier II and IIx models and can be serviced and reconfigured more easily. `` I think the IIcx is a product that should have been in the marketplace sooner,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It's probably the most appealing offering in the Mac family and should do well.'' He said sales of the Macintosh IIcx should begin making an impact on <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings in the next quarter, since the company is set to ship the computers immediately. <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> had some reservations about the new computer's price. `` The product is priced a little bit expensively,'' he said. `` But I think it would have sported a much higher price had Apple not had the difficulty it had'' when the company raised prices last fall in response to a memory chip shortage. The result of that price hike was a sharp drop in Mac II sales that is expected to hurt the company this quarter. Apple said in January it expects its second quarter, ending March 30, will see earnings in the range of 35 cents to 45 cents per share, compared with 61 cents per share for the same period last year. In the first quarter, ended Dec. 30, the company earned $ 140.5 million, or $ 1.10 per share. The IIcx, which may eventually make the Mac II obsolete, is just over 12 inches wide, compared with 18 inches for other Mac II computers. It will be available in four configurations: _ With one megabyte of memory and one floppy disk, selling for $ 4,669 _ With one megabyte of internal memory and a 40 megabyte hard disk drive, selling for $ 5,369 _ With four megabytes of memory and an 80 megabyte hard disk, for $ 7,069 _ A similar computer with four megabytes of memory, an 80 megabyte hard disk and A-UX, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T Unix operating system, for $ 7,552 One of the new high-resolution monitors <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> will show off has a 21-inch, two-page monochrome screen that measures 15 inches horizontally by 11.3 inches vertically. It allows user to display two pages side-by-side along with menus and scroll bars. The monitor carries a suggested retail price of $ 2,149. Its companion video card is priced at $ 599. The new Portrait Display, priced at $ 1,099, has a 15-inch diagonal flat screen that can show an entire page of text and graphics, including menus and scroll bars.

 The stock market declined slightly today, giving back some of Monday's gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.96 to 2,292.86 in the first half hour of trading. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 343 up, 394 down and 525 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 29.38 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing of economic growth in February. That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates might ease. But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might get some contradictory evidence later this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its statistics on the employment situation for February.

<HEAD>Productivity Edged Up at Rate of 0.1 Percent From October Through
December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers' productivity edged up at a tiny annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December while unit labor costs, a major inflation measure for business, shot up by 5.6 percent, the government reported today. The 0.1 percent rise in non-farm business productivity, output per hour worked, continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all of last year with a strong gain in one quarter followed by a poor showing in the next quarter. Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 1988 only to plunge at a rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter. It then rose at a 2 percent rate in the July-September quarter only to slow to the miniscule 0.1 percent advance in the final three months of the year. Of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labor markets and high factory operating rates were beginning to show up in inflationary pressures. Unit labor costs, which reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as changes in productivity, rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter, almost double the 3.7 percent rate of increase in the third quarter. It was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 6.8 percent rise in the second quarter last year. The figures released today represented only slight revisions from an initial productivity report issued a month ago. The 5.6 percent rise in unit labor costs was unchanged from the prior report. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> cited the sharp escalation of unit labor costs as one factor behind the central bank's recent anti-inflation moves. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is hoping that by pushing up interest rates it will dampen demand enough to cool an overheated economy and prevent an inflationary wage-price spiral from taking hold. For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent, matching the average annual gain since the end of the 1981-82 recession. While the increase was up slightly from a 0.8 percent rise in 1987, it was still far below the 2 percent annual gains the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is counting on in future years to shrink the $ 170 billion budget deficit to zero by 1993. Meeting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> targets for productivity is considered essential to reaching the administration's optimistic projections for overall growth of the economy without triggering higher inflation rates.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it posted a 13.1 percent gain in third-quarter profit due to higher sales volume, price increases and acquisitions. The Pittsburgh-based food giant said that for the three-month period ended Jan. 25, net income totaled $ 103 million, or 78 cents a share, up from $ 91.1 million, or 69 cents a share, for the year ago period. Third-quarter sales increased 9.1 percent to $ 1.37 billion compared with $ 1.25 billion for 1987. `` Higher volume, particularly in the domestic market, led our sales growth,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J.F </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>. `` In addition, we benefited from the acquisitions we made during the last 12 months and from price increases, mainly in our overseas markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> packs and sells an extensive line of canned foods under <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, Star-Kist, 9-Lives and Ore-Ida labels. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> said its net earnings increased 13.6 percent to $ 323 million, or $ 2.45 a share, from $ 284.3 million, or $ 2.14 a share, in 1987.

Operating income increased 16.5 percent during the first nine months to $ 587.1 million compared with $ 504.1 million in the same 1987 period. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said the increase was attributable to higher sales as well as the company's cost improvement programs. `` We are very pleased with our performance to this point, and we believe that we are well on our way to our 25th consecutive year of uninterrupted financial growth,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said.

 The Fair Trade Commission raided trading companies and their beef trade association Tuesday to investigate an alleged cartel to push up prices of imported beef, officials said. Inspectors went to 29 trading companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON> and Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and to the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mitsuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> All 29 companies belong to the 36-member semi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We have kept our eyes on them for almost four years,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> suspected the traders since 1984 had been fixing the share of imported beef each would sell to the <ORGANIZATION> LIPC </ORGANIZATION> before actual bidding took place. `` By fixing each company's share, the cartel prevents free competition in the market and raises beef prices,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. The illegal practice no longer exists, but investigations under the anti-cartel law can go into past actions, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. A group of 36 beef importers arranges imports, pays tariffs and sells their imported beef to the <ORGANIZATION> LIPC </ORGANIZATION>, which controls some 90 percent of beef imports. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imported 214,000 tons of beef in 1987 and 175,000 tons were sold through the LIPC.

 Grain and soybean futures were trading mostly lower this morning, against expectations, after a mixed opening on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the selling pressure was coming from the soybean complex, where some large speculators were cashing out after bidding soybean meal prices up sharply late in Monday's session. But the soybean market's early losses were limited by buying linked to a trade journal's report that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s imports of soybean meal halfway through the current marketing year were nearly double those of the same period a year ago. Wheat futures were nearly unchanged in early trading following reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, as expected, had accepted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bid for 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.35 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 2.78 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $ 2.09 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.69 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .08 cent lower with April at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .08 cent higher with March at 82.02 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .23 cent higher with April at 43.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .47 cent lower to .75 cent higher with March at 39.05 cents a pound. Cattle futures finished mostly lower on Monday while pork futures were mixed.

 The stock market showed a small loss today, giving back some of Monday's gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20.53 points on Monday, dropped 1.07 to 2,293.75 by noontime today on Wall Street. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 566 up, 675 down and 553 unchanged. Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing of economic growth in February. That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates might ease. But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might get some contradictory evidence later this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its statistics on the employment situation for February. Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise in open-market interest rates today.

 ABOARD DELTA FLIGHT 839 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Passengers and flight attendants on one <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> flight expressed exasperation today over a potentially time-consuming job action implemented by pilots nationwide in support of strikers at rival <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots union covering most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers ordered members to take enhanced safety procedures starting today because of safety concerns it said have arisen out of the 4-day-old strike at the troubled Miami-based Eastern. But if the views of people aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> were any indication, that was n't the pilots' only motive. `` I think they are doing it more out of sympathy,'' said passenger <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Licenzi </PERSON>, an engineer from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, after the cockpit crew delayed takeoff for nearly a half an hour on the three-quarter full flight because of what the captain called `` cargo loading.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant, who did not wish to be quoted by name, said the same cargo loading delay had waylaid the flight for 20 minutes on an earlier Atlanta-to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> run. The pilots declined to talk with an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter aboard and made no announcement to other passengers regarding the job action. `` It's just going to aggravate people all day long,'' said the flight attendant, a 10-year Delta veteran. `` What's the point of it?'' She said `` I think it's solidarity for their union. It's just they're little way of getting even.'' Passenger <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a merchant marine ship captain en route to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, said of the Eastern strike and the pilots' sympathy action: `` I think it's in poor taste Nobody wins.'' The Eastern strike has been a boon to Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, which in ordinary times is a highly profitable carrier that gets good marks from passengers for service. Thousands of erstwhile <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> passengers have been re-booked on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flights since the strike began Saturday. Despite the delay today, at least some passengers appeared not to mind and directed their criticism toward <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been reeling from financial losses and chronic complaints about service. `` I hope Eastern goes out of business and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> can buy their routes,'' said a plastics company sales manager from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who was aboard the <LOCATION> Miami-Atlanta </LOCATION> flight.

 About 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees at the company's huge <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> complex, some laid off since October 1987, are back at work after the automaker cranked up a second shift on an assembly line. The workers, who returned to their night shift jobs Monday, were met at the plant gate by Mayor <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and some <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union officials. `` It makes me feel good that we'll be back for a while,'' said welder <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Deason </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, who had been laid off for about 13 months. `` Everybody seems to be happy to be back. I know I am.'' The plant assembles full-size <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeSabres </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> 88 Royale automobiles. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamp </PERSON> said the employee recall was spurred by improving LeSabre sales. However, LeSabre sales are 13.4 percent lower this model year compared with last and 43.4 percent lower for the calendar year. In January, the factory began assembling <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> 88 <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> automobiles. Production of that car was moved to <LOCATION> Buick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Willow Run assembly plant in <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamp </PERSON> said. LeSabres will make up about two-thirds with 88 Royales making up the rest of the expected 1,040 cars a day produced by both shifts, <PERSON> Hamp </PERSON> said. Production at the plant was idled between Dec. 23 and Jan. 19 to retool for Oldsmobile production. The employee recall will bring to about 4,500 the number of workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant. In October 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> laid off about 2,000 workers because of sagging LeSabre sales, <PERSON> Hamp </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> has temporarily barred unionized <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> workers from staging a walkout in sympathy with machinists striking at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> at 3 p.m. Monday signed the order barring an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> walkout until at least 3 p.m. Wednesday.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today stood by his determination to stay out of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike as his transportation secretary appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to force government intervention. `` It would be inappropriate for the government to intervene and impose a solution,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at a White House briefing, adding that the dispute should be resolved through the `` free collective bargaining'' process. The president vowed to immediately seek legislation prohibiting secondary boycotts should the Eastern dispute spill over to other airlines or railroads. He urged the airline pilots union `` not to make ... the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to force government intervention in the strike by requiring the administration to impose a 60-day cooling-off period. `` It is far superior to allow the economic realities of the dispute to dictate the outcome,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on aviation. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also called on pilots for other carriers not to take any action supporting the Eastern strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had asked its 40,000 members to closely follow rules that could result in slowdowns at major airports. At the Capitol, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to provide national leadership'' by convening an emergency board to help settle the Eastern strike. He said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has recommended such a panel 33 times in the last half-century, and in each case the president has accepted the recommendation. `` For President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summarily to reject the board's recommendation and simply let things drift, as he has indicated his intention to do, would be unprecedented,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a statement he read to reporters He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` can do as previous presidents have done, as President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did in the steel crisis. That's leadership.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said failure to establish an emergency board and set a cooling-off period could at worst be `` a serious blow to the economy, the loss of jobs for thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and the further concentration of monopoly and erosion of competition in the airline industry. The nation can not now afford such a risk.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> testified that government action could neither solve the dispute nor save Eastern from bankruptcy. But he said he hoped the airline and union would reach agreement on their own. The secretary said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flew only 62 of its scheduled 1,057 flights on Monday. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> added 20 flights and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> five to make up for the canceled Eastern routes, but there were 970 fewer flights throughout the nation overall because of the shutdown. The subcommittee is considering a bill that would direct <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to set up an emergency panel to study issues in the strike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could veto the measure, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to override his disapproval. If enacted, the bill would stop the strike for at least 60 days while the panel investigates issues on both sides. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to take that action before the 12:01 a.m. Saturday end of a federally imposed cooling-off period. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said a presidential emergency board would be `` wholly inappropriate.'' `` The plain fact of the matter is that a strike at Eastern alone does not substantially disrupt this nation's transportation system,'' he said. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said if a boycott of other airlines takes place, the administration is prepared to introduce a bill to outlaw such activities. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the administration opposes a measure that would force an end to the strike because it believes in free enterprise and wants to ensure that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries remain `` as competitive as possible to maintain our place in the world.'' He said the economic deregulation of transportation has `` reaped untold benefits.'' The White House has said it might submit a bill that would ban <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees from picketing other airlines. But key Democrats said they would ask the aviation subcommitteeto to give quick approval to legislation directing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to set up an emergency panel to study issues in the strike. The creation of a panel would also compel Eastern for 60 days to continue paying salaries in effect prior to the walkout. The airline, which shut down nearly all its operations on Monday, claims it was losing $ 1 million a day and can not afford to operate without $ 150 million in annual pay cuts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> followed management urgings in refusing to step in. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that as long as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members refrain from picketing other airlines or railways, `` we would n't find it necessary to send up the legislation'' barring such secondary action. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is prepared `` to move rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.'' The spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is receiving `` daily briefings'' on the situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations rather than through government intervention. But Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., suggested that the emergency panel legislation he and committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., drew up `` might give cover to the administration'' for the action <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, aviation subcommittee chairman, did not contend that the strike had reached `` emergency'' proportions. But he called it part of `` a long-term problem with broad implications for the airline industry.'' `` If not an emergency, this is a matter of great public interest,'' he said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Monday that the `` private labor dispute should be allowed to follow its normal course'' without boycotts of other companies. `` Both sides need to get this issue resolved and get on with the business of this country and serving its customers,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. The secretary said he called the heads of other major airlines and asked them to help passengers affected by Eastern cancellations.

De Beers chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said revenue rose strongly, helped by a 13.5 percent price increase in May last year.

De Beers results follow the announcement earlier this year by the group's marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, that sales of rough gem and industrial diamonds by the organization totalled $ 4.17 billion in 1988, up 35.7 percent from 1987's total of $ 3.08 billion.

Last week, stock prices for both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> rose after <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> might be interested in buying the California-based company. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on that report, but some stock analysts discounted the speculation, saying it was unlikely <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would want to take on new challenges when it already faces delays and production problems in its commercial airplane division. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, a major aerospace defense contractor based in <LOCATION> Calabasas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, stopped making commercial jets in the mid-1980s. Its last commercial jet was the L-1011 TriStar, a three-engine widebody jet that went into service in 1972. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has suffered repeated delays in bringing out the 747-400, but started making deliveries earlier this year. With record orders for new business, the company also has had problems finding enough new skilled workers. `` Securing the assistance of the experienced <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> employees is one of the many steps we are taking toward meeting the new 747-400 delivery commitments we have made to our customers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. `` Other <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> organizations also are helping us by reassigning some of their experienced employees to the 747-400 program.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> workers who reported to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> are flight line and assembly mechanics and electricians. They average nine years of service with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> also is to provide electronics installers, quality control inspectors, methods analysts and production planners. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> ranked eighth in defense contracts in fiscal 1988, with $ 3.54 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was 10th at $ 3 billion, according to Pentagon figures.

 The stock market was little changed today, hesitating after Monday's strong gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20.53 points on Monday, inched up another 1.25 to 2,296.07 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 689 up, 667 down and 532 unchanged. Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing of economic growth in February. That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates might ease. But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might get some contradictory evidence later this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its statistics on the employment situation for February. Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise in open-market interest rates today. Advance estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 8 to 115 -LCB-. Analysts cited speculation that the company, in reaching its weekend agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other direction. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 8 -LCB- to 53 -LCB- as the most active issue in the over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to report lower earnings for its fiscal third quarter ending March 31. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .06 to 165.57. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .64 at 328.63.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will launch on April 1 an overnight service that delivers documents and small packages in the afternoon instead of midmorning at a slightly reduced rate, the company said Tuesday. The new FedEx Standard Overnight service promises next-afternoon delivery for packages up to 5 pounds, arriving by 3 p.m. in most areas or 4 p.m. in more remote locations. The current Priority Overnight delivery program promises deliveries by 10:30 a.m. in most locations. `` We saw a niche in the market for those people wanting a lower cost service for next-day delivery, but not necessarily next-morning delivery. We already have a priority overnight service,'' spokesman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said Tuesday. For letter delivery, the company said its door-to-door list price of from $ 8.25 to $ 11.25 would be the lowest in the industry. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, for example, charges at least $ 8.50 for its next-day air service. `` Test marketing of the new product in six cities confirmed that many customers who use our competitors do so when price is the prime factor,'' said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing and communications. The door-to-door list price for packages would range from $ 12.50 for a 1-pound package to $ 16.50 for a 5-pound package, the company said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> today laid off an additional 2,500 employees because it has no work for them in the fourth day of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike that has crippled the airline but failed to disrupt air traffic nationwide. `` We simply do n't have any business on the books today,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said at a news conference. `` Our competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, our traffic since March 4.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the airline was forced to halt nearly all its operations because its pilots had firmly supported the 8,500-member Machinists union, which represents mechanics and ramp service workers. `` If our pilots had come to work, this strike would be over,'' he said. `` We could have easily flown through a machinists strike.'' The nation's airline pilots today began a job action that had threatened to clog air travel on most airlines, but few delays were reported by noon. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Monday sent more than 7,000 non-striking employees home, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said today that just 1,500 employees remain working, down from from 31,200 before the strike. The airline had announced Monday it sent home 5,000 workers, but today <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the figure actually was 7,000. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> reiterated that a move to bankruptcy court was a last resort, and said, `` We do n't have any plans to throw in the towel.'' Flights were slightly delayed at some airports this morning, but officials said it was too early to know whether to blame bad weather, normal delays or a nationwide pilots' effort to strictly adhere to all regulations. `` The reports we have are that there has been no effect on operations,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a national spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The union continues to contend it is not conducting a slowdown, but is adapting to `` highly unusual circumstances'' it says threaten safety. This morning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said pilots should not `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn'' and stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union walkout. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, unions representing workers at three suburban rail lines that serve more than 300,000 commuters appealed a court order barring them from honoring any picket lines the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> set up at railways. A hearing was set for Wednesday. Lawyers for the Machinists and the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signalmen </ORGANIZATION> asked the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to overturn an order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> today extended his order, which had been effective until 3 p.m. EST Wednesday, to midnight Friday. It bars workers at those commuter lines from walking off the job in sympathy with strikers. The Eastern strike, which began Saturday and culminated a 17-month labor dispute, grounded most of the airline's flights, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse The airline wants $ 150 million in concessions; the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> want $ 50 million in raises. `` We can not run an airline with unpredictability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We can not continue to inconvenience passengers. We can not afford the steady financial drain.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would continue only its most profitable routes _ its shuttle between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and three round trips weekly between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Full-page advertisements for Eastern today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> urged `` Fly Us With No Reservations'' and promised that the shuttle is operating every hour. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, asked its 40,000-member pilots nationwide, beginning at 6 a.m. EST today, to adhere to rules `` to ensure the safety of the system,'' which he said had been weakened by the Eastern disruptions. As the workday began, air traffic was not crippled. `` Everything's quiet,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which operates the three major New York-area airports. Asked if pilots were conducting a slowdown, she said, `` No one has given me that indication.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> set up a special control center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to monitor the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> action. By 10:30 a.m. EST, no unusual delays were reported, said spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>, adding, `` We wo n't have anything until this afternoon, probably late afternoon.'' By 8:30 a.m. EST, no delays were posted on flight-status boards at counters of major carriers at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. National Airport flights began as usual at 7 a.m., and some flights took off, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` We wo n't have a handle on this until mid-day,'' he said about any possible disruption. `` If there a slowdown here, we ca n't see it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>, spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have so much excess capacity because <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s not flying we can absorb any such delays anyway.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> inspectors have been monitoring Eastern closely and have found no safety lapses, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> associate director. He said the agency was prepared to deal with the pilots' action. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to order its pilots to cross Machinist union picket lines. A hearing was scheduled today. Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday, although some <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flights left despite a snowstorm in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> doubled its rival hourly shuttle service to take advantage of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees were notified immediately of their `` no-work'' status and would receive lump-sum payments from $ 270 to $ 640, depending on their wages. They include ticket and reservations agents, clerical workers, customer service workers and some managers. `` My father went to work for Eastern in 1949, the year I was born,'' said gate agent <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` This company has raised me from a child. And all I can say is that now I'm ashamed about what the current management has done to Eastern.'' Some of those laid off joined striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> on picket lines. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but the pilots union put the number at 88. `` We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> local. `` This is a strike that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> called.'' The anti-union reputation of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unionized employees Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored the Machinists strike. Before the strike, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> claimed losses of more than $ 1 billion during the last decade, and $ 1 million daily. It also said it had $ 2.5 billion in debts stemming from its acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s only foreign factory soars above the Scottish countryside outside <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, a giant glass-metal structure that looks unique. It is n't. The <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> plant is modeled on the company's <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters. Its parent company is one of 275 American businesses operating in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The Scots historically have been highly successful in attracting foreign businesses, although the pace of overseas investment has slackened in the past few years. They hope the pace will accelerate again ahead of 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is to become one barrier-free marketplace. Investment has meant a great deal to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s hard-hit economy in the 1980s, creating jobs where the unemployment rate is 10.3 percent. But foreign owners of Scottish factories have been criticized for creating a segment of the economy that thrives on low-skilled assembly jobs. `` For the large companies 1992 will not come as a big surprise. They were already here. What we are talking about here are the small - to medium-sized companies for whom expansion in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would be the next logical step,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official Many companies are establishing a presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, by setting up manufacturing operations or arranging joint ventures and licensing agreements to ensure they're not shut out of the single European market of 320 million consumers when 1992 arrives. The largest share of investment in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, much of it in electronics, which has created a `` Silicon <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>.'' It is the largest such concentration in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, stretching from <LOCATION> Prestwick </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> in the central part of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where most of the 5.1 million population lives. Investment in 1987-88 totaled $ 580 million and created more than 6,700 jobs, vs. a $ 1.2 billion invesmtment credited with creating nearly 8,200 jobs in 1984-85, government statistics show. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share in the latest year totaled $ 194 million, which created or safeguarded about 3,600 jobs. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> tries to attract companies in electronics and health care, where it already has a substantial infrastructure that gives investors easy access to components and research. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> also sells the experience of existing American companies. `` We're very, very comfortable with the decision that took <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> to establish in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> manager. He said the company already has expanded operations at the 10-month-old plant. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s promoters also boast that the work force is cheap compared with those of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other European countries. Moreover, they say Scots are highly educated and readily available because of the high jobless rate. The English language also is a big factor in attracting American investors, experts said. `` It's not just language. It's language and culture. The Americans find the work force very similar to the work force in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Nonetheless, many overseas entrepreneurs remain skeptical of doing business here. For one thing, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> is remote, separated from the European continent by water. Critics also contend the Scottish workforce is not as cheap, flexible and well educated as the government officially proclaims. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION>, said large Japanese companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have preferred to establish factories in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Another problem is what business executives call a history of union stubbornness in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, abandoned plans to build an electronics plant in <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION> last year because of labor opposition to a single union there. `` We certainly have lost a lot of economic opportunity because of union intransigence,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, Scottish director of the Confederation of British Industry. In addition, some critics worry that foreign companies are n't transplanting their decision-making and research work to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Others say only a narrow range of overseas-based industries are setting up here, leaving the Scots vulnerable if those industries suffer downturns. `` There's been a high mortality rate of plants that came here in the 1960s and 1970s that did n't survive the'80s when the electronics industry slowed down,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday virtually ruled out intervening in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, saying `` man-to-man negotiation'' is preferable to a government-imposed settlement. While he did n't flatly rule out stepping in to end the walkout, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his policy `` will hold firm'' despite pressure in some congressional quarters to force him to act. The president had spare time in his schedule Tuesday because inclement weather forced him to cancel a planned trip to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, for speeches on his plans to attack drug abuse. As he stepped to the White House podium, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transportation secretary, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, was on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers not to pass legislation that would force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand on the Eastern strike. Under a provision of the Railway Labor Act, he could stop the walkout for 60 days while a presidentially-appointed panel investigated the dispute. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> responded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to halt the strike by appointing an investigative panel `` would be unprecedented,'' noting that over the last half-century 33 such boards have been named in transportation disputes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, used his opening news conference statement to `` restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best means of resolving'' the strike. He exhorted Eastern management, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and other unions to conduct `` head-on-head, man-to-man negotiation'' and said he thought that would be `` better and more lasting ... than an imposed government settlement, which could cause the airline to totally shut down.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged pilots threatening a sympathy slowdown in support of the strike not to `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.'' He reiterated that if the machinists try to shut down rail service he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban such secondary boycotts. `` It is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> that you're going to be caught up and victimized by a strike affecting an airline,'' he said. `` Simply is n't fair.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall On Brazilian Supply Prospects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting concerns about the imminent arrival of new supplies from the record-large Brazilian soybean crop. Grain futures finished narrowly mixed as spillover selling from the soybean complex was offset by bullish forecasts for relatively dry weather in the Plains and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. The soybean harvest in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest producer after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is expected to be the largest ever, despite a spate of unusually hot, dry weather early in the growing season. Analysts said the first soybeans from the new Brazilian crop could move into processing channels this week, partially alleviating the tight-supply situation caused by last summer's drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that cool temperatures in portions of the central and southern Plains last week had slowed winter wheat growth, which added to the bullish outlook for the wheat market. At the close, wheat was 2 -RCB- cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.34 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with March at $ 2.78 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.10 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.64 -LCB- a

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it would form two major exploration and producing regional organizations and streamline its operations in an effort to boost sagging production profits. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, president of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, said the new regions to be headquartered in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> are part of a major restructuring announced by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year and reflect a `` refocused business strategy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recently completed the sale of more than $ 7 billion in assets following its emergence from bankruptcy protection last year. The restructuring has reduced the size of the nation's third largest oil concern and focused its attention on exploration and production rather than refining and marketing. The two new regions and 12 divisions will replace the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary's existing 26 offices that currently employ about 7,300 people nationwide, company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeditz </PERSON> said. He said some employee relocations and reductions were expected, but, `` We're uncertain at this point as to the ultimate impact on employment.'' Specific plans for the restructuring are expected to be completed by the end of the year. `` The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead as possible, so that each division operates as would a successful independent company, making its own operating decisions with minimum review at other management levels while being accountable for its own performance,'' <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said. The New Orleans-based region, or the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Region </LOCATION>, will be responsible for the company's onshore and offshore exploration and production in the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard areas. The Denver-based region, or the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Region </LOCATION>, will be responsible for those activities in the Mid-Continent, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and other areas. Vice President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> will head the New Orleans-based region, while Vice President <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> will head the western region. Both will report to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rome </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, the executive vice president of exploration, producing and gas. The East Region's five units will include two exploration and exploitation divisions based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and two producing divisions, with one in <LOCATION> Harvey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and the other in <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The fifth division, also based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, will be responsible for producing properties owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> but operated by others. The West Region's seven units will include producing divisions in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; two exploration and exploitation divisions in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; a division in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that will be responsible for Texaco-owned properties operated by others; and an exploitation unit in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>'s other major `` upstream,'' or exploration and production, business, may be in for some restructuring in the future

 The stock market pulled back a bit today after the Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run past the 2,300 level. The market's advance Monday was prompted in part by a monthly report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing of economic growth in February. That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates could ease. But analysts said some traders were fearful that they might get some contradictory evidence later this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its statistics on the employment situation for February. Advance estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday reported a 7 percent gain in first-quarter profit compared with the previous year, although earnings would have fallen except for unusual items For the three-month period ended Jan. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> said its net earnings totaled $ 69.2 million, or 58 cents a share, up from $ 64.7 million, or 54 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue totaled $ 1.35 billion, up 14 percent from $ 1.18 billion in the year-earlier period. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western's three operating segments are publishing, consumer and commercial lending, and entertainment, including <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, Madison Square Garden and theater circuits. The company said first-quarter results included $ 5.1 million stemming from an accounting change related to the recognition of finance income and a one-time gain of $ 5.6 million from the sale of a 50 percent interest in the company's domestic theater operations. The accounting change related to finance income should continue to add about $ 5 million a quarter to earnings over the next two to three years, the company said. Without that gain and the gain on the sale, earnings would have dropped. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western said total receivables in its consumer-commercial finance unit exceeded $ 13 billion for the first time, led by healthy advances in consumer real estate lending. Motion picture operating income was strong but television operations posted the largest percentage gains due in part to the popularity of `` Webster'' and `` Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western said. However, the company's <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster publishing unit recorded a loss in consumer operations despite strong sales of some hardcover bestsellers. The losses reflected higher product support expenses, the company said.

 This airport bedroom community, founded by aviation pioneer <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON>, was hit especially hard when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> idled 9,500 employees in last two days. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> has owned the <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION> jewelry shop for eight years in the corner of the central drug store in this city of 12,000 on the edge of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Now he wonders if he'll be looking for a new job soon. Open for 2 -LCB- hours Tuesday, <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON> went to his desk to locate his only receipt for the day _ a $ 2 repair. `` By this time of day, I was usually crowded and people were waiting outside,'' said <PERSON> Hidalgo </PERSON>. `` My survival amount to cover everything is $ 100 a day. Yesterday I made $ 62.'' He feels the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union against money-losing Eastern is to blame. Shopkeepers around the downtown traffic circle estimate 40 percent to 60 percent of their business comes from the airline industry and a significant segment of that from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, whose headquarters is just outside the city. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a newsstand employee at the airport for 17 years, was wondering how much longer the airport concession would keep her shop open in the nearly deserted Eastern terminal. `` I live in the Springs, and practically all the people that live in the Springs work for Eastern,'' she said. At one point, she called the strike by the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union `` very foolish'' but, no matter what happens, she concluded, `` Nobody's going to win.'' Her employer already has closed stores on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttered boarding ramps and is pushing its workers to take vacations or shift to a four-day work week. `` I've been here 17 years and I make $ 5 an hour. I always say half a loaf is better than nothing,'' she said. `` It's going to be a sad thing down here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. It's bad.'' Ticket agents and skycaps who on Monday were placed on what <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> calls `` no-work status'' were called in Tuesday morning for a meeting with management. A supervisor told them they could apply for unemployment benefits but could be called back at any time. Their medical insurance expired at midnight Monday, no vacation pay would be considered, and questions about early retirement went unanswered. The `` no-work status'' means `` we hope it's a shorter term, in other words, that we hope we'll be able to call them back to work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>. `` We're hoping that they'll be coming back, so that's where that stands. <PERSON> Iza </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON>, a 24-year Eastern veteran who had been working in international passenger services, hugged co-workers and wiped away tears as she headed to pick up a paycheck. `` We do n't get vacation pay, we do n't get severance pay, we do n't get anything,'' she said `` They're upset, very upset, because they want to know what's happening in the future,'' said ramp service manager <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazeau </PERSON>, a 23-year Eastern veteran Skycap Red <PERSON> Bloise </PERSON> resents both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and President `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> ` Ostrich' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, because he has his head in the ground.'' `` They're giving us this no-work status garbage because this way they do n't have to give us the stuff we've earned,'' the 10-year veteran said as he left for home and his children. `` Now that we're out of a job, we wo n't even get to Disney World. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said the workers were laid off, but workers were told they had been placed on `` no-work status,'' eligible for unemployment benefits but without severance pay, vacation pay, medical insurance or answers to questions about early retirement. `` The difference is that we hope it's a shorter term, in other words, that we hope we'll be able to call them back to work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>. `` We're hoping that they'll be coming back, so that's where that stands.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marilynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoss </PERSON>, whose grandmother worked for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said she could n't be anything but optimistic. `` I think that's the only attitude you can take is be positive,'' she said while filling orders at a gift shop filled with Easter baskets, colorful balloons and St. Patrick's Day fare. Others were n't so enthusiastic. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, operator of Circle Barber Shop and a real estate agent, recalls airline workers mowing lawns and taking jobs pumping gas in previous strikes.

<HEAD>Agency Says Confusion Between Pedals Is Likely Cause of Sudden Acceleration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The most likely cause of cases of sudden acceleration involving the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 and other cars is drivers stepping on the wrong pedal, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The agency, however, said drivers may not be to blame for confusion between accelerator and brake. The difficulty in selecting the right pedal may be `` aggravated by vehicle design,'' the agency said. A yearlong study of sudden acceleration, conducted by the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, found that a car can suddenly speed up to full power only if the throttle is opened almost completely to provide oxygen to the engine. Other proposed theories of sudden acceleration, such as problems with the cruise control or electronic idle speed control systems, failed to meet the test of an open throttle while the brakes are applied, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has conducted more than 100 investigations of unwanted acceleration involving 20 manufacturers since the late 1970s. The agency's investigations of the problem have resulted in 26 recalls and manufacturers have conducted another 75 recalls. A major sudden acceleration case involved the West German-made <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. In late 1986 the company recalled about 250,000 of its 5000-series automobiles for installation of a `` shift-lock'' device, which prevents the transmission from being put into forward or reverse without the brake pedal being depressed. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that the report `` is a breath of fresh air as far as we're concerned.'' `` While the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> chose to use the term ` pedal misapplication,' we feel that it is fundamentally what we've been saying,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. He was skeptical that design factors in the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> could have contributed to confusion among pedals. `` Our pedals are optimized for braking efficiency, for driver control,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` These cars are designed to be driven on autobahns at 100 mph plus.'' The Center for Auto Safety, a critic of the auto industry, declined comment until it could see a copy of the report. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> rejected the conclusion of a Canadian study and some automakers that sudden acceleration was due to driver error. `` ` Driver error' may imply carelessness or willfulness in failing to operate a car properly,'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` ` Pedal misapplication' is more descriptive of what occurs. It could happen to even the most attentive driver who inadvertently selects the wrong pedal and continues to do so unwittingly.'' A report by <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, issued in January, concluded that sudden acceleration `` occurs as a result of driver error.'' Pedal placement, shape and feel may be factors that lead drivers to press the wrong pedal, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the agency said proposals for any design changes must await further research. Complaints of sudden acceleration are based on instances when cars allegedly go to full power from a standstill or slow speed, usually after the driver has moved the automatic transmission from park into drive or reverse, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency excluded from its definition of sudden acceleration instances of high idle speed or throttle sticking.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Rise On Platinum's Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A resurgence of commercial and speculative buying pushed platinum futures prices to a 3-month high Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and boosted gold and silver futures as well. On other markets, crude-oil futures tumbled; soybeans retreated; grains were mixed; cattle futures advanced; and pork futures fell. Platinum settled $ 4.80 to $ 5.30 higher with the contract for delivery in April at $ 551.50 a troy ounce, the highest close since the market's mid-December collapse from levels near $ 600. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 5.20 to $ 5.80 higher with April at $ 395.70 a troy ounce; silver finished 6.5 cents to 6.8 cents higher with May at $ 5.965 a troy ounce. Platinum's slow climb back from less than $ 520 an ounce reflects both renewed commercial demand from the Far East and the gradual return of bullish speculators who bailed out of the market following the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Dec. 14 announcement that it had developed a catalytic converter that did not use platinum as a primary ingredient. The use of platinum as a chemical catalyst in the automobile pollution-control devices accounts for about a third of global platinum consumption. With <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> still testing its new converters, the platinum market's attention has gradually returned to the existing tight-supply situation, which is expected to persist into the 1990s Yet platinum traders remain cautious, an attitude underscored by Tuesday's activity. The April contract traded as high as $ 559 during the session, then dropped back as traders lost their nerve and took profits. `` Still, you've got to give the market some credit just for getting up there,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metal-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In contrast, the gold and silver markets closed near their highs, indicating a greater willingness among traders to gamble that prices of those metals will continue to rise. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodity trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said gold's performance on Tuesday `` tells me we're in for a short-term pop to the $ 400 area,'' a level the gold market has not seen since late January. Tuesday's sharp drop in energy futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was attributed to technical factors rather than to a change in the bullish fundamentals that have recently driven crude-oil futures to prices approaching $ 19 a barrel. Those positive factors include agreements by non-OPEC oil-producing countries to reduce their crude-oil output in a concerted effort to boost prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents lower with April at $ 18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .57 cent lower with April at 51.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .18 cent to .54 cent lower with April at 51.41 cents a gallon. Soybean futures prices fell moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting concerns about the imminent arrival of new supplies from the record-large Brazilian soybean crop. Grain futures finished narrowly mixed as spillover selling from the soybean complex was offset by bullish forecasts for a week of relatively dry weather in the Plains and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 4.34 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with March at $ 2.78 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.10 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6 \ cents lower with March at $ 7.64 \ Cattle futures moved moderately lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in technically inspired selling while pork futures rose on expectations for lighter marketings and higher cash prices. Live cattle settled .05 cent .42 cent lower with April at 77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent lower with March at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .37 cent higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .55 cent higher with March at 39.10 cents a pound.

 The stock market posted a small loss Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run past the 2,300 level. Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, up 20.53 points on Monday, slipped 4.11 to 2,290.71. Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 708 stocks rising, 730 falling and 524 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 172.50 million shares, up from 168.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 204.94 million shares. The market's advance Monday was prompted in part by a monthly report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing of economic growth in February. That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates could ease. But analysts said some traders were fearful that they might get some contradictory evidence later this week when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its statistics on the employment situation for February. Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise in open-market interest rates Tuesday. Street estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 9 \ to 116 -RCB- Analysts cited speculation that the company, in reaching its weekend agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other direction. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares rose | to 48 ~ Some other entertainment issues gained ground for the second straight session in reaction to the plans for Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western, which reported higher quarterly earnings, climbed 1 \ to 47 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to Oil-service stocks, which have benefited from recent strength in oil prices, were broadly higher today.

 Even with its planes idled and thousands of its employees on furlough because of a strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was interviewing applicants for jobs as flight attendants Tuesday. Union members, picketing outside the hotel where the interviews were held, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was trying to line up non-union attendants to replace <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members. The company denied it and said it was simply going ahead with the interviews because of help-wanted ads it placed before the strike. Several of the 15 to 20 young men and women who showed up for interviews said they were not aware that the airline was in difficulty. Similar interviews were held in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Sunday and Monday and also were picketed by unionized attendants. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of Local 533 of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the flight attendants, said Eastern was also interviewing in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Tuesday and was planning interviews in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We are meeting these people at every hotel,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. `` We have had great success in convincing people to turn away. We handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money, and we said please come back some day when things are better at Eastern.'' Flight attendants have joined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots in honoring picket lines thrown up Saturday by the airline's 8,500-member Machinists union. Eastern announced Monday it was sending more than 5,000 workers home. And most planes were grounded by the crippled airline, the nation's seventh largest. This did n't deter a young woman who would identify herself only as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> as she emerged from the room where she had filled out a form and talked with an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> representative about future employment. `` I want a job,'' she said. `` I really didnt know about the controversy that was going on.'' The airline's ad, which appeared Sunday, said, `` Tired of the nine to five grind? See more of the world in a month than most people see in a lifetime. Eastern is currently recruiting flight attendants and would like to consider you a candidate.'' The ad said the jobs would pay $ 1,000 to $ 1,200 per month in base salary plus expenses. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, who was conducting the interviews, said they were `` basically informational.'' Asked in a telephone interview whether the interviewing session had anything to do with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s current difficulties, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, `` Yes, it does. I think at present we need to make sure that we can get this operation back on its feet.'' `` We are not passing out applications,'' he said. `` We are just trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be interested in working for Eastern in the event that we had to do some replacement of flight attendants.'' When a reporter arrived at the hotel, however, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, `` What we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in the newspaper ads, rather than lock the door. We had no idea we would be faced with this situation.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said he believed the ads were placed last Wednesday. Outside the hotel, <PERSON> Teal </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a stewardess with Eastern for five years and a member of the union, said, `` They're hiring scab flight attendants to replace us.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an official of a union that represents workers at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> where the interviews took place, said he telephoned <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, general manager of the hotel, Monday night and `` asked him to throw Eastern out of there.'' `` His response was that they had already rented the place, and they could n't legally get out of it,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who is executive secretary-treasurer of Local 25 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said of the company, `` It was a situation that they could have avoided. I do n't foresee it happening again.'' The airline has 7,000 flight attendants. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashelford </PERSON>, a picket who said he had been with Eastern for 23 years, suggested new attendants would be hired at much lower pay. He said an experienced flight attendant makes about $ 1,800 a month plus $ 25 an hour for flying time in excess of 75 hours a month. <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, told that the pickets did not believe his account of the purpose of the interviews, said, `` They probably would n't, as a result of the climate that we have now at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. But I can assure you there has been no plan made as a result of what has happened.'' The woman named <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> said company interviewers did not talk to her about the union or tell her that people were being laid off. She also said she was not given encouragement that she would get a job. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Folefac </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said he was aware of the strike, but that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> representatives told him `` they were just trying to honor the ad in the paper.'' He, too, said they did not give him any encouragement.

 A divided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel approved a union-sought bill Tuesday that would compel President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, despite administration insistence that such involvement would not settle the bitter dispute. The legislation, passed 21-12 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, would require <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board to study the impasse that has grounded most of the carrier's flights and to recommend a solution. During this process, there would be a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which the striking employees would return to work. The bill is not expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor until sometime next week. Although many lawmakers concede that there are not enough votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override an expected presidential veto, Democrats say the exercise is worthwhile because of the pressure it places on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to find a solution to the work stoppage. `` When we send the bill to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk, we're passing a hot potato back to him,'' Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, D-Ore., said after the panel's vote `` What's his solution?'' The legislation would require the emergency board to study the dispute between not only <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its striking machinists, but between the airline and two other unions whose contracts have expired: the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents flight attendants. `` We want to stick it all into the same bag, settle it all at once,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bsh </PERSON>, in a session with White House reporters, repeated his belief that the `` free collective bargaining'' process should resolve the standoff. He said it would be `` inappropriate'' for the government to impose a solution. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the panel that he would recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto the legislation, arguing that the `` frustrations and animosity'' between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management and its striking workers was building and would fester despite a board's appointment `` You ca n't run an airline where you have the kind of animosity over a period of time building up,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. Democrats, however, argued that a board could produce a solution to the dispute, which began Saturday and has pitted Eastern against its 8,500 machinists and ramp workers represented by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the carrier's pilots and flight attendants have also walked off their jobs in support of the machinists, in a dispute focusing on wages and benefits `` The emergency board gives cover to both parties to reach agreement,'' said subcommittee chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also sought to pressure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a board, telling reporters that presidential leadership was needed. `` He can do as previous presidents have done, as President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did in the steel crisis,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` That's leadership. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> sounded a similar theme to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, blaming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to appoint a board for the strike. `` It is time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fill the leadership void the president has created,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told the lawmakers. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the subcommittee that administration remains poised to introduce legislation that would prohibit secondary boycotts of railroads and other airlines that labor has threatened to support the Eastern strikers. `` A strike at Eastern alone does not substantially disrupt this nation's transportation system,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` It is only the specter of secondary activity that threatens to hold hostage this nation's economy and our global competitive position.'' In his session with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated that secondary boycotts `` are not in the public interest and I will send legislation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forbid them, if that is necessary.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> drew occasionally testy questions from the panel's Democrats, who kept demanding to know why the administration has so far adopted a passive role in the dispute `` There has n't been any rolling up of sleeves and getting in there,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I'm not afraid to go anywhere, anyplace, and put anybody in a room'' to find a settlement to the strike, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> responded Even some Republicans were critical of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, and said they had not decided whether they would support the Democrats' call for an emergency board. But other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` To convene an emergency board and return to the wages and working conditions of last week will only further bleed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and endanger its survival.'' Democrats said they expected the administration to have little chance of getting its bill through the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. All 19 Democrats on the subcommittee who voted supported the legislation. All but two of the panel's Republicans opposed the measure: Reps. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, both from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On a related issue, <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON> introduced a bill Tuesday that would require air carriers to submit plans to protect their ticketholders in case of bankruptcy. <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON> said `` tens of thousands'' of travelers have already purchased tickets for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights, some of which might not be redeemed if the airline reorganizes under the bankruptcy laws.

 <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, is negotiating with lenders to stretch out payments on $ 135 million in bank debt, the parent company said. The steel unit, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, faces a $ 44 million payment on the debt March 31. The holding company is not responsible for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' debt. <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> met Friday with a group of its bank lenders, led by <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, to discuss restructuring the debt, officials said Monday. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said auditor <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may include an `` explanatory paragraph'' in its report on the company's financial results for the year The paragraph, described as slightly less severe than a qualified report, would reflect uncertainties about Lone Star's ability to complete the proposed debt restructuring, the company told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Buoyed by overly optimistic projections of demand for its oilfield products, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> borrowed heavily last year to purchase high-quality slab steel used to manufacture pipe. Bank debt in the year soared to $ 144.1 million from $ 108.3 million. But the steep downturn in world oil prices dried up the market for oilfield products, and Lone Star in 1988 posted a $ 24.8 million loss. Despite two profitable quarters early in the year, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> steel operations contributed more than half of the loss. As a result of the latest downturn, the company in August laid off 300 workers at its steel mill in Lone Star, which in its heyday employed more than 6,000. In January, the company eliminated 150 additional jobs as part of its reorganization of its steel operations. Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said it has tried without success to find other sources of financing. To raise cash, the company said, it sought possible joint-venture partners or buyers for selected assets.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earnings jumped 63 percent in its first quarter compared with the same quarter of 1988, spurred by a $ 55.7 million gain from the sale of its stock in <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Net earnings were $ 44.4 milion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $ 28 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same period last year, the company said Tuesday General <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON> said revenues from its beverage bottling division and ticket sales at its movie theaters increased, but operating profits declined due to higher soft drink promotional spending and higher operating costs for new and larger theaters. Revenues for the three months ended Jan. 31 totaled $ 607.5 million, up 9.8 percent from the first quarter of 1988, but operating earnings fell to $ 40 million from $ 46 a year earlier, the company said. During the first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Genera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell its soft drink bottling business to <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.75 billion in cash, but the transaction is subject to approval under antitrust laws by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said the deal was expected to close by late March or early April The soft drink bottling business contibuted $ 167.8 million in revenue and $ 12.2 million in operating earnings to first-quarter results, the company said.

 A federal judge Tuesday refused to order <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots back to work, even though <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> warned it could n't otherwise survive the 4-day-old Machinists strike A spin-off job action by pilots nationwide failed to clog airports as feared. Eastern earlier sent 2,500 more non-union workers home, blaming pilots for leaving it with `` no business on the books.'' `` If the pilots do not come back to work, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is gone,'' company attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. He warned during a court hearing that Eastern was faced with bankruptcy without its 3,600 pilots, who have firmly refused to cross picket lines the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union set up Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a temporary restraining order less than a half hour after the three-hour hearing. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> called the ruling `` a victory of principle; a victory of ethics.'' Later, the pilots union reported that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management called its negotiators to try to set up new talks. No details were immediately available. `` Basically, we're extremely cautious,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said, adding that no talks had yet been scheduled. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company would appeal <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' ruling immediately to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the company could n't operate more than 48 to 72 hours more without the pilots, and could have to file for federal bankruptcy protection. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said bankruptcy would be `` a course of last resort.'' He declined to speculate on how long it would be before Eastern would make such a move. Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, already has nearly shut down, saying it was forced to lay off a total of 9,500 workers this week because of the pilots' adherence to the strike in a 17-month-old contract dispute. The airline wants $ 150 million in concessions; the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> want $ 50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $ 1 billion this decade and $ 1 million a day before the strike. The national pilots union had asked its 40,000 members at all airlines to follow rule books stringently starting Tuesday, and there were fears of havoc as delays piggy-backed around the country. But while the union said 60 percent of its members followed the directive, delays were few. `` The reports we have are that there has been no effect on operations,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the job action would continue, but he did not know for how long. The union contended its action was not a slowdown but an effort to ensure safety during the strike. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> at a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called the effects `` sporadic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` the system so far has operated in a close to normal manner.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said there had been sporadic requests for more-than-usual handling by air traffic controllers `` but the system has been able to accommodate those requests.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said pilots should not `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn,'' and stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the walkout by the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents mechanics and ramp service workers. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to force the administration to impose a 60-day cooling-off period. But a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved a union-sought bill Tuesday that would compel <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene by appointing an emergency board to study the impasse between the airline and union and recommend a solution. It would include a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which the striking employees would return to work. The bill is not expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor until sometime next week, and many lawmakers concede there are not enough votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override an expected presidential veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if the Machinists try to shut down rail service later this week he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban such secondary boycotts. He said the strike should be settled through bargaining, but no talks are scheduled. Secondary boycotts, particularly in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people. Unions representing workers at three suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rail lines Tuesday appealed a judge's order issued over the weekend barring them from honoring any Machinists picket lines set up at railways. An appeals court hearing was set Wednesday, but the lower-court judge extended his order, originally set to expire Wednesday afternoon, through Friday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has just 1,500 employees still working, down from 31,200 before the strike, according to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president and chief operating officer, who announced another 2,500 layoffs Tuesday. `` We simply do n't have any business on the books today,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` Our competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, our traffic, since March 4.'' Some union members have speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and its chairman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, are trying to tear the carrier apart. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s anti-union reputation has galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unionized employees. `` One of the problems in this situation and the reason it's gone on for 17 months is Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s credibility with his unions is about as low as you can get,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` He thought the pilots would cross. It's pretty clear to me the pilots had no intention of crossing the picket lines.'' Nearly 3,000 Eastern employees jammed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Knight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> downtown Tuesday night for a teleconference being carried by satellite television to 11 other groups across the country. `` Lorenzo makes <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON> look like <PERSON> Gomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the cheering union members. Eastern has contended the pilots, who along with its 5,900 flight attendants have honored the picket lines, are conducting an illegal strike. But pilots attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Linsey </PERSON> said the pilots can honor the strike under the Railway Labor Act. Flights were slightly delayed at some airports Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s action, which was to take advantage of the discretion pilots have in deciding preflight and prelanding checks, such as reading flight plans to controllers `` Everything's quiet,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which operates the three major New York-area airports. `` If there a slowdown here, we ca n't see it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>, spokesman at <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had accounted for 26 percent of the traffic before the strike. Airports in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, reported few or no delays. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> officials said fog delayed some flights. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> said the pilots' action delayed some <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flights, while <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flights by non-union pilots flew on schedule. `` It certainly is n't by accident,'' commented <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airport. Eastern has said it would continue only its most profitable routes _ the shuttle between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and three round trips weekly between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040 flights daily. On Tuesday, the shuttle was `` running at full throttle,'' with all 62 flights, but not with full loads.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched up against the Japanese yen after opening lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and share prices also rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar, which opened at 128.68 yen, down 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close, inched up to 128.78 yen by late morning. The currency moved in a range between 128.65 yen and 128.90 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 61.08 points Tuesday, added another 135.30 points, or 0.42 percent, to finish the morning session at 32,073.24. Dealers said the index rose after investors regained confidence in the market after a favorable showing in Tuesday's session. Stability in the foreign exchange market also contributed to the Nikkei's rise Wednesday, said <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He added, however, `` There are still some uncertainties over how the stock scandal will affect the government.'' The Nikkei index declined upon the start of trading Tuesday following the arrest of a leading executive on charges of bribery in a major stock-profiteering scandal with links to leading politicians. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, former vice labor minister, was arrested on bribery charges in the same stock scandal but morning trading closed before reports of the arrest surfaced. In currency dealings, the dollar slumped from the previous day mainly due to selling for profit-taking, traders said. Market participants were reluctant to make major moves before Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures for February, said one trader.

 Strike-crippled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shut down nearly all operations and idled at least 5,000 workers Monday, saying it could not afford to maintain the 60-year-old business while pilots honored a 3-day-old Machinists walkout. `` We can can not run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We can not continue to inconvenience passengers. We can not afford the steady financial drain.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would continue to run only its most profitable routes _ its <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and three round trips weekly between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The dramatic action in the 17-month labor dispute came after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to order the financially ailing carrier's 3,600 pilots to stop honoring the Machinists' walkout and return to work `` The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the company,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` We believe that it is an illegal weapon to gain -LRB- the Air Line Pilots Association's -RRB- economic objectives.'' He said 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees were notified immediately of their `` no-work'' status and would receive lump-sum payments ranging from $ 270 to $ 640, depending upon their normal wages. With more than 17,000 workers on strike, honoring picket lines or laid off, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has about 7,000 active employees, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` I just ca n't believe that they got away with this,'' said a weeping <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, 24, a ticket agent at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. She was one of a group of non-union employees going into a hastily called evening meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> managers at the terminal. The laid-off employees were told to report back at 9 a.m. Tuesday to turn in their identification badges. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would file for bankruptcy only as a last resort but indicated the pilots' walkout may force the airline to consider the option. `` We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union head <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>. `` This is a strike that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> called,'' he said, referring to parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose anti-union reputation has galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s union The injunction request filed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> came as pilots nationwide planned a sympathy job-action starting Tuesday morning that threatened to delay every flight on every airline. Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday but had supervisors haul baggage and de-ice planes to keep its top-priority <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flying some scheduled trips between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> despite a snowstorm. As of 8 p.m. EST Monday, 69 flights had taken off, 25 of them on the Northeast shuttle, the airline said. Four or five more shuttle flights were expected by the end of the day. Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> averaged 1,040 flights carrying 100,000 people daily. Eastern pilots are honoring a strike by 8,500 mechanics and ramp service workers that began Saturday. The strike has grounded most flights, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse `` You ca n't fly without pilots,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s future was under `` hour-to-hour evaluation.'' Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> claimed losses of more than $ 1 billion in the last decade, $ 1 million a day and said it had $ 2.5 billion in debts stemming from its acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986. A top credit-rating agency said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly $ 400 million in cash will drain fast because the airline must pay competitors to fly waylaid passengers and is facing a $ 70 million debt repayment within weeks. `` The strike poses a serious threat to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s survival, and management may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection if more pilots do n't return to work soon,'' <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but the pilots union put the number at 88. Eastern had 85 flights Saturday and 93 Sunday, the company said, including three shuttle flights with 14 or fewer passengers. Eastern averaged 1,040 flights daily before the strike. The pilots union advised members Monday to ignore an order and personal plea from Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> to return to work, alleging `` threats and intimidation'' by management. The company said the pilots would be classified as strikers if they did not return to work by noon Tuesday. Eastern implied they could risk their seniority, pensions and jobs. Eastern asked the federal judge for a preliminary injunction against the pilots union, ordering them back to work and requesting damages. A Tuesday afternoon hearing was scheduled. `` I think it's time to face this for what it is _ a pilots strike,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said. `` We waited to see whether this was an initial demonstration and whether they would come on back, but now it's time.'' Eastern said under the 1926 Railway Labor Act the pilots must continue negotiating a new contract and may not strike. The law says unions may strike only after federal mediation, which the Machinists underwent before striking. `` We knew that was coming,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, adding that association attorneys would study the motion. Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored the strike by mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew. Eastern is seeking $ 150 million in concessions while the Machinists are demanding $ 50 million in pay raises. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants and pilots to continue honoring Machinist picket lines. `` Those three unions have stood shoulder to shoulder in an admirable display of solidarity,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` All of us stand ready to give you the support you need to see this mission completed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Associate Director <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> said inspectors are monitoring Eastern closely and there had been no safety lapses. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to respond to the planned pilots action but did n't elaborate. The national pilots union planned a teleconference for all members to explain the action set to begin at 6 a.m. Tuesday. Pilots would strictly follow aviation safety rules, which could dramatically slow air traffic. `` It's an individual thing, obviously,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots' union spokesman. `` The captain of the plane decides what he wants to do. But we are encouraging our pilots to observe the fly-safe.'' The international <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union planned to appeal a federal judge's order barring sympathy strikes on three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> railroads that threatened to disrupt the morning commute for more than 300,000 people. No strike-related transit problems were reported in any cities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> on Monday also temporarily barred unionized <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> workers from honoring any picket lines by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't push for a bill banning secondary picketing unless the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spreads The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee scheduled a hearing for Tuesday and said he hoped for quick action on legislation to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board and halt the strike for 60 days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had refused to intervene. The sharp cuts in operations have affected thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 100,000 daily passengers Eastern said many stranded <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> vacationers were back on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland Monday. A morning snowfall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other problems forced cancellation of 10 of the first 16 Eastern flights on the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> was doubling service on the same routes. Eastern officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said employees were asked to wear warm clothing and boots and supervisors handled baggage, de-iced planes on the runway and worked as flight attendants to keep the shuttle flying. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> donned an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot's cap and led chanting strikers in a prayer session at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ticket counter. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> broke a 1983 strike at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> by filing for bankruptcy. `` If <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> ca n't fly it, let the workers buy it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said.
