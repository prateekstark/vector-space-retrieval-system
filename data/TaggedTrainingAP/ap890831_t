 <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>'s aging stockpile of nerve and mustard gas, 42 percent of the nation's chemical arsenal, will be destroyed on-site in a new $ 138 million incineration plant, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Office of the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said none of the chemical munitions at the remote western <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> desert installation would be moved elsewhere for destruction. While the decision did not address other sites where chemical weaponry is stored, it was considered a victory for advocates on-site disposal at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and seven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. The Army had considered disposing of the weapons at regional plants or one national site, which would have required potentially risky transport by air, rail, truck and barge. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Proving Ground, the program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical demilitarization effort, said similar announcements are expected for the other sites where chemical weapons are stored, once environmental studies are completed. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision followed recommendations contained in an environmental impact statement released in July. The new plant will employ a construction work force of about 350, and once operational in December 1992, will have 400 employees. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said site-specific <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION> studies, such as the one conducted at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>, also are planned for <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Anniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lexington-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark; Pueblo Depot Activity, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Umatilla </LOCATION> Depot Activity, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Further on-site disposal decisions are expected to be made `` down the line,'' as each <ORGANIZATION> EIS </ORGANIZATION> is finished, she said None of the studies has been completed. Tooele's stockpile, some of which dates back to World War II, includes nerve, mustard and other blistering agents contained in rockets, artillery projectiles, mortar rounds and bombs. In all, the depot has nearly 800 such munitions, some of which are leaking, stored in earth-covered igloos. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said the new plant will use disassembly and incineration technology studied at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>'s Chemical Agent Munitions Disposal System pilot plant and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johnston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> Agent Disposal System facility. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the old chemical arsenal destroyed by 1997.

<HEAD>Four Children Die in Early Morning Fire at Foster Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A predawn arson fire in a foster home killed four children and injured 12 other people, with two adults and four children hospitalized in critical condition, fire officials said. The fire was the work of an arsonist, said fire Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Christmas </PERSON>, who added that smoke detectors were found in the house but nothing indicated they had been installed. He would not elaborate. Neighbors said they woke up shortly before 3 a.m. smelling smoke and hearing the cries of children. `` I heard the kids and they were screaming, ` Help me! Help me!' It was horrible,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, who lives next door. When firefighters arrived at the three-story, stone-and-frame house, they found heavy fire in the first floor and people trapped upstairs. Neighbor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he woke up hearing a car in the street honking its horn. `` Then I looked out the window and I saw all this fire raging in the front of the house,'' he said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he ran behind the house and found three or four children who had jumped from second - and third-story windows He said he looked up and saw `` five or six more'' standing at the windows. `` They were crying and shaking and screaming,'' he said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he tried to build a platform out of wood so the children could have a shorter distance to jump. `` They would n't jump on it, so I told them to jump and I'd catch them. So they jumped and I tried to catch them or break their fall,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The fire was under control by 3:20 a.m., firefighters said. Seventeen people lived in the house, firefighters said. The children who died were found on the second floor. Police identified the dead children as <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON>, 7, and his brother, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON>, 5; <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavenhouse </PERSON>, 15. The house belonged to <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Artis </PERSON>, a couple who took in foster children and had lived on tree-lined Park Avenue for about 13 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Artis </PERSON>, 65, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with multiple fractures and smoke inhalation. Also in critical condition at <LOCATION> Einstein </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, 20, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 15, and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 3, all suffering burns and smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 17, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with burns, and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 12, was in critical condition at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christopher </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for Children. In addition, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 28, was in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a fractured wrist and smoke inhalation. Three others, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Artis </PERSON>, 65; <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 20; and <PERSON> Latasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 18, were being evaluated at Temple for burns and smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 2, was treated at Temple for smoke inhalation. Neighbor <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> described the Artises as a good-hearted couple who took in so many children because they had plenty of room in their spacious house. The Artises had been foster parents since 1972, according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olanoff </PERSON> of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. State law prohibits more than six children in a foster home, but police counted 11 children living among the 17 residents of the house when the fire broke out. <PERSON> Olanoff </PERSON> said the department granted the Artises a waiver to care for eight children about a year ago.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Five in Insurance Office</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with silencers apparently used, claim
Medellin cartel sympathizers behind shooting; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three gunmen apparently using silencers opened fire in a medical insurance office Thursday, killing five people and wounding a sixth before fleeing, police said. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said the gunmen opened fire without warning in the third-story Medical Collection Services office in suburban <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedras </LOCATION>. She said police suspected robbery was the motive. The office was ransacked, but it was not immediately known if any money was taken. An anonymous caller, saying he represented the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, telephoned the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday and claimed the shooting was retribution for `` the decision taken by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his allies'' to help the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's war against drug lords. It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the caller's claims Police Superintendent <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said he never heard of the group, and did not speculate on whether it could be responsible for the shooting. <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said police were investigating. The five killed were <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, both 36, the couple who owned <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and three employees, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON>, who manages the building where the agency is located. A fourth employee, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerra </PERSON>, in his 50s, was seriously injured by a gunshot wound in the back of the head. <PERSON> Cerra </PERSON> told police and reporters that the gunman knocked at the office door and immediately began shooting when he opened it. He said he was hit and then fell to the ground unconscious. He was hospitalized at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. No other people were in the office at the time, police said. Since no one else in the building heard the shots, police said they believed the gunmen used silencers. Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the police spokeswoman, said officials did not know whether the gunmen stole any money from the agency, which mailed clients' claims forms to insurance companies and received payment through checks. The anonymous caller said six people jailed in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and allegedly linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel `` are not alone and we are ready to fight to the end because the money we obtain -LRB- from drugs -RRB- is used exclusively for the proletariat.'' The anonymous caller said the shooting `` constitutes a clear, precise and final message that we know the government will wisely understand.'' Several weeks ago the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, on the east side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, began hearings for six peopel allegedly linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. Prosecutors claim the six dealt in $ 10 million worth of cocaine every week and were responsible for the March 7 shooting death of a man in <LOCATION> Trujillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, in northeast <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Their trial is expected to begin in September.

<DATELINE>LEWISVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twenty years after a pop festival took over this <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb, a beer company is sponsoring a rock fest that shows the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> era is long past. Organizers put together the 1969 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lewisville </LOCATION> in seven weeks with a shoestring budget, but <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has pushed this weekend's concert series for more than a year with television ads and other promotions. At the shows, the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way to drinking arrangements for designated drivers. `` The whole tone of the two shows 20 years apart is remarkably different,'' <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, who promoted the <LOCATION> Lewisville </LOCATION> festival, said Tuesday. Just three weeks after the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> rock festival in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, about 120,000 people spent three days on a field outside <LOCATION> Lewisville </LOCATION> to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King, Grand Funk Railway, Led Zeppelin and others. This weekend, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> hopes to draw 500,000 people to concerts in six <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities, including performances by the Who in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The concerts culminate a 16-month campaign by the company. In addition to the Who, performances by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> and the Gang, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and many others are planned in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midland-Odessa </LOCATION>. It took <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> seven weeks and $ 120,000 to line up all 30 acts. Promoters of the <LOCATION> Lewisville </LOCATION> festival said they lost $ 100,000. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has n't disclosed its budget, but the Who grossed $ 1.04 million at a concert before 47,000 fans in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> three weeks ago. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has pledged to give at least $ 1 million in proceeds to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Special Olympics. The company and promoters have made elaborate security arrangements. People will need wristbands to gain access to the concerts. Designated drivers will receive different colored bands entitling them to free soft drinks and baring them from buying beer. Twenty years ago, drugs were common, but the crowd behaved. There were only 36 arrests, most for public intoxication. `` Psychedelics and pot, I believe, were the prevalent stimulants of choice,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION> judge who was mayor of <LOCATION> Lewisville </LOCATION> from 1969 to 1973. When it was over, residents were surprised by the long-haired, easygoing rock fans. Some concertgoers mowed lawns and babysat for residents during their stay. `` That was part of the mind-blow thing that went on here,'' <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> said. `` People expected all these folks to be real nasty, and here they were handing them flowers, just as polite as they could be. It disarmed them totally.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Fish Defects Down but Pollution Still a Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A recent study of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> found fewer fish with bent fins, dwarfism or liver abnormalities associated with pollution, but researchers say the inlet is far from environmentally sound. `` We do n't conclude from the study that in fact things are getting better,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, senior scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Edgerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>.

However, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Wednesday, defects were markedly higher than the numbers found in cleaner environments further out in the sea. `` No changes have gone on in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> yet,'' he said, adding that partially treated sewage still is being dumped there.

<TEXT>
 A man who sued his ex-girlfriend to prevent her from having an abortion dropped his lawsuit Wednesday, saying he believed she was n't pregnant. <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> dropped his lawsuit after learning through a variety of sources, though not from a medical examination, that the 23-year-old woman known as `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' was not pregnant, said his attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>. However, the woman's attorney said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> knew no more about her client's condition Wednesday than when he began his court fight last week. `` They've dropped the case. ... We take the position that that is a victory,'' said attorney <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON>. The withdrawal nullified a court order barring the woman from seeking an abortion, canceled a <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the lawsuit scheduled for Thursday and left Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON>'s client free to do what she wished. Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said the woman `` was extremely relieved'' by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s decision. The woman still refuses to say whether she is pregnant or not, her attorney said. <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> asked the woman to take a pregnancy test, but she refused. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and the woman had a three-month relationship that ended a month ago, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had wanted her to carry the fetus to term if she was pregnant, Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said. On Aug. 23, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> won the temporary restraining order, which had been set to expire next Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said the withdrawal of the lawsuit vindicated her belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did not have jurisdiction in the case and affirmed what she said was a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy in the first three months. <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> countered that the case did not need to proceed once <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> became convinced the woman was not pregnant. `` I do n't think this particular case ended up being a test on any issue because it was stopped,'' he said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the lawsuit appeared to be part of a concerted effort by anti-abortion activists to alter the law. `` This is guerilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.'' <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s motives were sincere. `` This case was not brought for publicity reasons,'' he said, predicting the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July decision expanding the states' right to limit abortion could spark similar cases.

<HEAD>Inside-Out Knot Adds New Twist on Men's Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For men who think fumbling with a tie each morning is a pain in the neck, here comes a new wrinkle in the quest for a firm, symmetrical knot. It's an inside-out style called the Shelby. Touted as the `` first new knot for men in over 50 years'' by a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> clothier, the knot was introduced to a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> TV anchorman by a viewer who chafed at his lumpy, twisted neckwear. `` I got sick and tired of looking at his tie every night. He always had a big knot in it,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, 92, a retired manager for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> who lives in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. So in 1986, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> collared <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> in the lobby of <ORGANIZATION> WCCO </ORGANIZATION> and, quick as you can say clip-on, shared a formula he had used for at least 40 years. The secret is to start with the seams out. With a bit of sartorial sleight-of-hand, the knot forms securely and the broad part flows down the shirt, finished side out. The shorter blade underneath still has the seams and the label facing out, although it can be clasped with a pin or twisted so the seams will turn in. It's simple to tie and works best with wider collars. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, as humble as he is meticulous, said he stumbled across the knot by accident and never thought of it giving it a name through decades of secure wear. `` One morning I put my tie on inside out, I tied it and it worked. That was it,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. `` The beauty of it is the knot wo n't twist to one side or the other. A tie sets the whole theme of dress. If it's twisted, that's the first thing people notice.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M </PERSON>, a custom men's clothier in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, learned of the knot, refined it and established the tie-in with <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>. It printed a five-step diagram for customers seeking alternatives to the bulbous Windsor knot or the tightly tapered four-in-hand, the most common knot among American men. `` You're getting a balanced knot, but it's small and precise, not big and bulky like the <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kingford </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavender </PERSON>, an executive with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` I made up the cards because I had so many customers ask me, ` Why does your tie hang so much better than mine?''' But because the knotting begins with wrongside out, purists may not like it. `` It's not for everybody. You'll never see one of the Kennedys wearing it,'' <PERSON> Bavender </PERSON> said. The knot's newness apparently is legitimate. The method of creating the Shelby does n't appear in `` Getting Knotted _ 188 Knots for Necks,'' a reference guide for ties, scarves, ascots and cravats distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Ratti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Como </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and used by the <ORGANIZATION> Neckwear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. However, it does resemble a knot called the <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>, invented by a Milanese restaurateur and said to have been the favorite knot of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Krushchev </PERSON>. `` It's a variation of the <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON>, but it was not documented anywhere I've seen,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Neckwear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who notes that 100 million ties are sold each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and American men own an average of 20 ties. `` Personally, it leaves a little too soft a knot for my taste. I prefer a knot that has more body to it,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. For his part, <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> is a bit red-faced at all the fuss. `` I really think people notice the knot in your tie about as much as the knot in your shoes,'' <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> said. `` I do it because it's easy to tie, you can do it in your sleep, and it puts that little dimple in the tie automatically `` Now I'm known for the knot. People come up to me and say, ` Hi, <PERSON> Don </PERSON>. How are you? Nice knot you got there.'''

 Here are five steps involved in tying the Shelby knot. 1. Start with the tie seamside out, with the wide end under the narrow end. 2. Loop the wide end over and under the narrow end. 3. Tighten to take up slack. 4. Take wide end across to the right and under the neck loop. 5. Thread wide end down through the knot and tighten.

 In days past, weddings in <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>'s family called for the slaughter of 20 sheep. But when a brother got married three months ago, two were sacrifice enough. The wedding was a victim of the 20-month intefadeh, or uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, which has squeezed livelihoods and altered lives for Palestinians throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Repeated strikes by Palestinian workers, curfews imposed by the Israeli army and a drop in tourism have slashed incomes. As the economy has declined, the Jordanian dinar _ the key currency in the occupied lands _ has plunged in value by 50 percent, further ravaging savings and paychecks. Badr, whose family has owned a four-table restaurant in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for 25 years, said his business has been devastated. `` Before, if you wanted to get food, you'd have to wait outside for half an hour,'' said <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>, who now closes for the day at noon to comply with the orders of clandestine uprising leaders. `` Today you see: in a half an hour, we sold only two Coca-Colas.'' Nearly all Palestinians insist that the struggle for daily bread has not weakened their will to resist Israeli occupation. But the dinar's recent plunge coincided with a seeming drop of intensity in the uprising and an increase in factional squabbling in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks. `` If you are angry and hungry, you have to satisfy your hunger first,'' explained <PERSON> Tarik </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, who owns a photo shop near <LOCATION> Badr </LOCATION>'s restaurant But he said that rather than forcing an end to resistance, more violence is the likely result. An official of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military government in the occupied lands said economic hardship was beginning to be felt in a widespread way for the first time but that it was too early to say it would mean an end to the uprising. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Palestinian incomes have fallen and buying power is probably half what it was when the uprising began in December 1987. Average incomes per capita declined by 25 percent from a pre-uprising level of $ 1,000 a month. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said the falling value of the dinar `` has disastrous effects.'' The currency has been a major means of payment and savings for Palestinians since <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> lost the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967. `` Here people only believed in God and the dinar,'' said <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Feidy </PERSON>, a money changer on <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Din </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The dinar was worth $ 3 early last year, but fell to less than $ 1 in July before recovering recently to about $ 1.50. Hospital workers, college teachers, Islamic preachers and tens of thousands of private employees still earn wages in dinars, and most paychecks have not risen as the dinar's purchasing power declined. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, an Islamic preacher who dropped by to visit <PERSON> Badr </PERSON>, said he was forced to move his wife and two children out of their apartment and into a single room of his father's house. `` My salary is 160 dinars,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, noting that it used to be worth about $ 480 but now is worth $ 200. `` The impact on people here is devastating,'' said <PERSON> Feidy </PERSON>, the money changer. `` The worst part is that people have their dinars in Jordanian banks and they ca n't bring them.'' In an effort to stem the flow of orders and money from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sharply curtailed travel and financial transfers across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Palestinians can now bring in only 200 dinars a person per month. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has countered a tax boycott by Palestinians with increased fees on vehicles. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafaar </PERSON>, a teacher who has seen his salary cut in half because of the frequent strikes and school closures, said fees on his car have risen to the equivalent of about $ 700 a year from $ 80. He has opened a small grocery store in his home. `` The shop is not a way of living but it helps.'' he said.

 <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yugui </PERSON> and her seven `` old aunties'' preside over Shady Willow Street like boarding school headmistresses, poking their noses into everyone's business with government blessing. Did someone park their winter coal supply in front of someone else's door? Is a mother-in-law quarrelling with her daughter-in-law? Is a student playing hookey? Is anyone marrying, pregnant or getting divorced? All this and more the 72-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> regards as her business. Her eight-member committee of retired women _ and committees just like it in every neighborhood of every city in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ are the very backbone of the Communist government's public control system, the grassroots link in the chain of supervision. The committees, appointed by local authorities, are unpaid. `` Everyone knows me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> said of her 1,085-family neighborhood, made up of one main street and seven small alleys. `` When people hear ` old aunty' has come, it's ` Please come in.''' Many urban Chinese are less warm in their descriptions of the `` lao dama'' _ `` old aunties'' _ of the neighborhood committees, regarding them as nuisances at best, and dangerous snoops at worst. During the spring democracy movement, when hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students and ordinary citizens poured into the streets to march for reform, the committees came into their own. On many streets, the old aunties went door to door urging residents not to join the protests. Their armies of political activists in red armbands, also all retired, stepped up patrols of the neighborhoods for unusual activity. After the army used force to clear away the protesters on June 3-4, the committees helped search homes for any weapons stolen from the army and reported on residents suspected of `` counterrevolutionary'' activities. Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> kept such good order in her domain that <LOCATION> Shady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> has been named a model `` People-Army Cooperation Street.'' A circular issued by the party <ORGANIZATION> Propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declared the neighborhood an example of building `` socialist spiritual civilization'' and said Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON>'s committee showed `` a firm political stand, a high degree of socialist consciousness and a lofty patriotism.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> said she had no sympathy for the protesters, not even for the students whose weeklong hunger strike brought 1 million concerned residents into the streets. `` It's hard to get into college and the government spends money to train them,'' she said. `` If their health is ruined how can they make contributions to the country?'' Not one of the neighborhood's 3,750 residents, not even its 34 college students, took part in the protests, she vowed. Two students went to have a look _ but just once, to see the excitement, she said. Then they went back to their books, checked on daily by her and the other old aunties. Some older residents also went to look, she conceded, but `` very few, very few.'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> has lived here many years and all the students know her ... and love her,'' said <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuyun </PERSON>, an official from the local subdistrict office. `` So they listen to what she says.'' If they do n't love her, they might well fear her and her fellow aunties. Each day after getting together to read the official newspapers and study the latest government order, the eight graying women split into pairs and divide up the neighborhood, visiting stay-at-homes, inquring about their health and other news. Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> said it would be impossible for any fugitive student leaders to hide in her domain. As soon as a stranger hits the neighborhood, she said, `` we will know right away.'' Questions are raised: `` Is he a friend? Where is he from? Did he register with police?'' Chinese law requires travelers to notify the local police station when staying away from home. The houses on Shady Willow Street are ancient one-story buildings built around small courtyards, sometimes with a dozen families per unit. Each courtyard has a chief who knows what the families in his unit do, where they go and who their friends and relatives are, Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> said. During the spring turmoil, she said, the chiefs checked up: Was so-and-so at home today? Where did he go? When did he get back? `` If someone took part in the protests the courtyard chief would know right away,'' she said. `` We ca n't guarantee everyone tells what they do,'' said district official <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaomin </PERSON>, gently correcting Mrs. Gao. `` It's possible someone went out for a stroll and did n't say anything.'' `` But nothing happened or they would have been arrested,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gao </PERSON> shot back.

 `` Manny'' looks a bit the worse for wear, suspended in an Army warehouse with his stainless steel joints and plastic sensors exposed and a dusty black rubber mask on his head. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers will someday have the mechanical man to thank for the effectiveness of their protective clothing. `` What we are hoping to achieve is to give the soldier greater confidence in the protective materiel he has available to him,'' said <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, scientific director at this remote post in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s western desert. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said he realized in 1985 that static mannequins and simulated chemicals were n't realistic enough to gauge clothing's protective capacity `` It just occurred to me, through various tests and results, that we should be able to do a better job in the testing of protective gear,'' he said. The idea was born for <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>, a $ 2.8 million robot <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> calls `` the closest thing to a human being possible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sent its specifications to <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, which had devised robotics for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to handle radioactive materials. Last November, <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> delivered the 5-foot-11, 187-pound robot, which is attached by a mechanical arm at the small of the back to a stainless steel control unit housing hydraulics and electrical systems. Later this year, <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> will ship a hermetically sealed test chamber capable of containing such agents as chemical vapors and nerve gas, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, technical group leader for mechanical systems and robotics. <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> will operate within the chamber in an undisclosed building on the 840,000-acre base, where the Army tests defenses against chemical warfare in the event it becomes a reality despite treaties banning it, <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said. The base obtained permission for such tests in 1982, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>. Tests involving biological agents are n't planned for the near future, but they are `` within the realm of possibility,'' <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said. A clear plastic molded on forms sculpted in aluminum gives <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> human shape, and electrical heaters keep a `` skin'' temperature at an even 98.6 degrees. Even without the outer skin of butyl rubber, <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> cuts an eerily human figure. His 38 joints are powered by rotary and linear actuators that enable him to walk at 3 mph, crouch, wave, sit, stand and crawl as guided by a computer program. The skin is fitted with sensors that can detect penetration of up to one-billionth of an ounce of a chemical or nerve agent. Perspiration is achieved by water coursing through capillary tubes on the surface of the rubber, and moist air is injected at the nose and mouth as air bladders in the chest expand and contract. Such realism is necessary to ensure that the stresses of human movement, particularly on seams, wo n't compromise protective material that might be subtly altered by a soldier's breath, said program manager <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>. While toxic substance protection is <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>'s prime mission, the robot also is likely to be used to test the spectrum of military garb from firefighting gear and flight suits to field uniforms. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> and computer operator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> have spent well over 500 hours testing <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>'s systems and writing movement programs, including a performance the robot gave during a six-week display at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> last winter. <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> drew crowds every time he ran through a 10-minute routine of drop-kicking a ball, walking, crouching, duckwalking and explaining his actions in a clipped electronic voice before folding into the pose of <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>'s sculpture, `` The Thinker.'' In more than 500 hours of testing, <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> has been damaged only once, losing a knee-joint shear pin in a collision of his limbs, said <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>. Replacing the pin took 15 minutes. The Army has no plans for a second robot, although <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said the possibility remains open. `` I think a lot of it will be based on his performance,'' <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON> said. `` Personally, I think he'll do very well, but only time will tell.''

 <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the drug lord who owned this town, was generous one day and evil the next. He gave money to adults and toys to children, killed people who displeased him and had a gallows in his yard. Few residents of Pacho would talk with a reporter about the billionaire former pig farmer, who would pass out $ 7,500 or so when he felt good and, when he did n't, might kill a motorist who got in his way. Last week, the crackdown on drug traffickers led the army to his hometown of 20,000 people 50 miles north of the capital <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the army colonel who led the raiding soldiers, said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> was so feared in Pacho that, when his 18-year-old son went into a bar, the doors were closed to everyone else until he left. The son, <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON>, was arrested last week, but his father is still at large. At the main ranch, soldiers found 500 dolls wrapped for next Christmas inside the house and a wooden gallows outside. The government has confiscated the ranches and other property belonging to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> ordered the raids and arrests after <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons killed Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the leading presidential candidate and a foe of the drug trade, on Aug. 18. Leaders of the drug cartels are said to own major office buildings and hundreds of ranches, and their importance to towns like <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> is enormous. `` The people here will resent it, but in the end they will adapt to the new situation. We had no alternative,'' <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said of the raids. He was interviewed at his headquarters office in one of the houses on a horse-breeding ranch <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> owned. Resentment is clear in Pacho, but whether the townspeople will adapt is not. They make little effort to disguise their hostility to outsiders. `` This town boomed on Saturday nights and restaurants like this one were packed,'' said <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a restaurant manager, speaking to a reporter and a photographer. `` Now look. You are my only customers. This town is dead.'' For years <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> was owned almost entirely by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. Most people's jobs depended on him, directly or indirectly. `` His word was the real law here,'' said <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON>, of the 13th <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, which seized 20 ranches in the Pacho area in less than a week. He said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> owned 18 of the ranches and `` at least 80 percent of the town was his.'' `` He is barely 41 or 42, but he was Pacho's master and he demanded respect for his status,'' <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said. `` If a car got in his way and the driver did not apologize, he was a dead man. Nobody here had the right to protest without putting his own life at stake.'' Government officials say the property seized in the anti-narcotics campaign _ which includes 300 ranches, houses and apartments _ is worth more than $ 200 million. Newspapers value the traffickers' total property holdings in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at $ 5.5 billion. <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> once tried to change <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON>'s name to <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, which he also chose for his main estate, or hacienda, `` but he could n't get enough support for it'' from government officials. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s choice of the name <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, a state in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, reflected a passion for Mexican culture that led friends to call him <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexicano </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pistolacho </PERSON>, the hacienda canteen, was done in Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> western decor, but former employees said it served more scotch, gin, French champagne, Chilean wine and German beer than tequila or mescal. Beside the canteen is a wooden gallows, complete with noose. It does not seem strong enough for a hanging, and the colonel said it appeared to be a symbol for the owner's bandit culture. `` Whatever it was for, it is macabre,'' he said. Pacho soon may feel the pinch of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>'s absence, because he distributed money lavishly, <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said. `` We know he gave away some 3 million pesos -LRB- $ 7,500 -RRB- daily,'' the colonel said. `` He was seen as a benefactor. Everybody had a job and everybody was happy. ... What he gave let him control the population.'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Mexicano </PERSON> left <PERSON> Pacho </PERSON> as a pig farmer in the 1970s and returned as a rich man in 1982. He bought up ranches, frequently `` making offers nobody could reasonably refuse,'' which <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> translated as `` sell or die.'' `` He always paid well,'' the colonel said. `` If somebody was working elsewhere for, say, 40,000 pesos a month -LRB- $ 100 -RRB-, he doubled it.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> even monopolized bus transportation in the region. His company and its buses also have been seized, and `` people in town will complain about bad transportation,'' <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said. Soldiers found hundreds of Christmas gifts in the main house, including the 500 dolls and dozens of pairs of U.S.-made jeans and sneakers. <PERSON> Uscategui </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was arrested along with seven bodyguards: `` The population thought no one would dare capture him. Well, we did it.''

 State and local governments face increasingly difficult budget choices as the growing AIDS epidemic siphons more of their resources, according to a privately financed survey. Most states continue to rely heavily on federal money to support AIDS programs, but nine _ including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ are spending more of their own funds this year than they are getting in federal grants. Additionally, states further down in the ranking of cumulative AIDS cases are increasing their spending to battle the disease by 10-fold or more, said the survey by the AIDS Policy Center at the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` AIDS is going to increase the budgetary tradeoffs the states must make,'' said <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, who helped conduct the survey paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. In fiscal year 1989, states spent about $ 495 million in non-Medicaid funds on AIDS education, prevention, testing, care, research and other related activities. Of the total, states contributed $ 252 million from their own resources and received $ 233 million from the federal government to spend through state programs. The rest came from private sources. Overall, the bulk of federal AIDS spending is handled directly by the federal government or is funneled through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to private researchers. The House of Representatives has approved $ 1.6 billion for AIDS prevention, education and research during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. That is the level requested by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. However, there is growing emphasis on money for treatment _ especially now that the expensive drug AZT has been recommended for hundreds of thousands of people who carry the AIDS virus but do n't show symptoms of the disease Patient care `` is the next frontier'' for state spending on AIDS, especially with new government recommendations encouraging early intervention with expensive drug therapies and patient follow-up, the survey said. Currently, 64 percent of all non-Medicaid funds for AIDS-related patient care come from state coffers, the survey said. In a related development, 14 activist organizations wrote <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to ask for a reduction in the price of AZT, sold only by the North Carolina-based drug manufacturer. The letter said that the $ 8,000 annual cost per patient of AZT will make it difficult to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to renew a program that subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who can not afford it. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the letter springs from `` a failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies operate.'' `` It is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research,'' she said. Costs for development, marketing and research, she added, `` are very, very high.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> gave 30 million capsules, wholesale priced at $ 1.50 each, to the federal government for the AZT trials. Also, she said, the company continues to conduct studies of the drug. Public health officials believe that up to 1.5 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are infected with the AIDS virus. As of July 31, AIDS had been diagnosed in 102,621 Americans, of whom 59,391 have died since June 1, 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Federal officials estimate that by the end of 1992, the number of reported AIDS cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will total 365,000. In that year alone, more than 80,000 new cases are expected to be reported and 65,000 people with AIDS are expected to die. Most state funds are spent on education, testing and counseling and patient care. Spending this fiscal year in these categories for the states overall more than doubled from last year, the survey found. Besides <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the states spending more than they received in federal funds this year are: <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On the other end of the spectrum, eight states are relying solely on federal funds for AIDS activities: <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The survey did not include AIDS spending growth rates for individual states because of differences in the data collected from year to year. But <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said the general trend shows that states with lower prevalence rates are increasing their AIDS spending the fastest. While <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> increased its state AIDS spending by 35 percent and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by 31 percent, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, ranked 8th in prevalence, boosted its state spending 10-fold, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, ranked 7th, and No. 13 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state each increased their spending 12-fold, she said.

<HEAD>AIDS Activists Call for Price Reduction for Anti-Viral Drug AZT</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AIDS Spending, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fourteen activist AIDS organizations are urging the company that makes AZT to cut the $ 8,000-a-year cost of the only drug approved for use by AIDS patients. In a letter Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the groups said lowering the cost not only would benefit those patients and their insurers already paying for it, but would make it easier to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come up with the millions of dollars needed to supply AZT to those who can not afford it. `` Without a price reduction, it is politically more difficult, if not impossible, to secure reauthorization and new funding to finance the program needed to provide treatment for all those who need it,'' the letter said. AZT is marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> under the brand name Retrovir. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said the letter reflects `` a failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies operate.'' `` It is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research,'' she said, adding that development, marketing and research costs `` are very, very high.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> gave 30 million capsules, wholesale priced at $ 1.50 each, to the federal government for the AZT trials and continues to conduct research on the drug. The activist groups said they were heartened by recent trials that suggest hundreds of thousands of people infected with the AIDS virus but not yet showing symptoms can benefit from taking AZT. `` Now that the evidence suggests a vastly expanded need for the drug,'' the letter said, the problems of finding a way to pay for it are `` greatly amplified.'' It maintained that `` a large portion'' of the total cost in researching, developing and producing AZT was paid by taxpayers. `` In effect, we have been asked to pay for this drug three times: first in its initial development, next in financing many of the studies needed to permit its marketing, and finally to buy it from you,'' the letter said. The 14 groups endorsing the letter identified themselves as organizations `` devoted to the welfare of people with HIV.'' Among the groups were the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS Project; the Gay Men's Health Crisis; the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Copies of the letter were distributed to <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and to other <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials, along with some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and to the news media. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the company has had to invest heavily to test and manufacture the drug, but have declined to make their precise costs public. AZT was first synthesized under a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> grant in 1964. In 1984, some <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> lab tests showed it to be effective against some animal retroviruses and the company offered it for testing by federal laboratories. <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> scientists proved in 1985 that it was active against the AIDS virus. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> then was granted a license to manufacture and test the drug. The clinical trials were directed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Removal of Bad Odors Seen as Prime Need in Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> wants to improve Third World cities _ by making them smell better. Not only are odors from bad sanitation and bad fuel for cooking and heating offensive to the nose, they're unhealthy, says <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, a senior urban planner for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. People in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s biggest city, burn a lot of dung and wood. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, it's wood and charcoal. That pollutes indoor air in a way that may be related to a range of lung diseases, tuberculosis and cancer, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> says. The pollution comes from poor ventilation, regardless of the kind of fuel. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s study, `` Environmental Dilemmas and the Urban Poor,'' was made public Wednesday as part of a more general report called `` Environment and the Poor: Development Strategies for a Common Agenda.'' Women and children, who spend more time at home, are probably affected more than men, he said. `` The adverse effects of household airborne and water-carried wastes on child mortality and female life expectancy are of no less global proportions than, say, the destruction of tropical forests, and in immediate human terms may be the most urgent of all worldwide environmental problems,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> wrote. The bank is the biggest source of aid loans to Third World countries, lending more than $ 19 billion a year. `` Dealing with bad smells _ human waste and indoor air pollution _ will get you a bigger immediate return in human well-being than many other things we do,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which published the report. The council is a private research group, financed by foundations. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> reported that new kinds of cooking stoves designed for Third World use have run into trouble because they are n't what people are accustomed to. But he added that they are a good idea because a 10 percent improvement of cooking efficiency could save millions of tons of wood a year and help solve the health problem. `` Contain the heat, vent the exhausts,'' he advised. Ventilated pit latrines cut down costs by two-thirds and standard specifications can be reduced to make them cheaper and to use more local labor, he said. He called for more research not only on stoves, but also on toilets that flush when water is poured into them and small, maneuverable pumps for latrine systems. Such things may seem second class, but the people who use them and the donors who provide them will learn to appreciate them, he said. `` Short-term gains in health may come to be valued by the poor as much as or more than the loss of status they perceive for having a second-class _ that is, less than standard _ system for cooking and waste disposal,'' he wrote.

<TEXT>
 The oil industry is intensifying its attack on a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan requiring the use of methanol in some cars by 1995 to control the growing smog problem in the nation's most polluted cities The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the major oil companies, has hired consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> to speak against replacing gasoline-burning engines with those capable of running on methanol, or wood alcohol. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a mechanical engineer and former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official, told reporters Wednesday that his research showed methanol is no less environmentally harmful than gasoline. He also contends it is more costly and less safe. `` Methanol is not an inherently clean fuel,'' he said. `` It is just as dirty as gasoline.'' The oil industry has voiced strong doubts about methanol since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed in June that 500,000 cars capable of burning methanol be sold by 1995 in cities with the most serious air pollution problems, and that 1 million be sold each year starting in 1997. The administration contends that methanol-burning cars will help reduce the formation of smog because they emit fewer hydrocarbons. It also says increased use of methanol will reduce the nation's growing reliance on foreign oil used to make gasoline The oil industry, which produces about 100 billion gallons of gasoline a year, has a powerful interest in keeping it the predominant transportation fuel. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> acknowledged that tests show cars running on methanol emit fewer poisonous hydrocarbons than those burning gasoline. But he said the administration has overlooked or discounted research that indicates methanol-burning engines emit far more formaldehyde, a chemical that helps form smog. The major oil companies say they have been researching possible uses of methanol as a transportation fuel for years and will continue to do so. But, through their trade association, they have strongly criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal as too ambitious. They say more emphasis should be put on researching cleaner formulations of gasoline.

<HEAD>Infectious Swine Disease Found in U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An infectious swine disease previously found only in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and is being viewed as a possible contributor to recent losses suffered by Corn Belt hog producers. The disease is a type of leptospirosis, caused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called leptospires. About 180 types of leptospires cause disease in livestock, said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON>, veterinary medical officer with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said in a report released here Wednesday that the disease, caused by an organism called bratislava, was found in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> herd. The name resulted after the bacterium was isolated in 1953 from a hedgehog in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine, but the leptospires also can pass through the pregnant female's placenta to the fetus. Another probable cause of infection is thought to be venereal transmission from infected boars. Humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop leptospirosis, the report said. Outbreaks of a mysterious syndrome causing stillbirths, abortions and pre-weaning death in pigs that began a year ago throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> have prompted <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists to look into several possible causes, including bacterial and viral infection, and moldy corn, <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> infection `` is being studied as one possible contributing factor to this syndrome,'' she said. The study was undertaken five months ago at the agency's animal disease center in Ames under a `` technology transfer'' agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with bratislava to `` establish absolute proof'' that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> version causes reproductive disease. Also, laboratory tests must be conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant sows. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is marketing two vaccines under conditional <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> licenses and is applying for permanent licensing, she said. Company scientist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> said vaccination with the conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against `` clinical signs caused by bratislava'' through one pregnancy. He recommended vaccination prior to each breeding. Leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe, and is often misdiagnosed, the agency said. The disease in humans has been confused with influenza, hepatitis, yellow fever, pneumonia, polio, meningitis and encephalitis.

 A partial list of changes in <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations affecting the care and handling of animals for laboratory experiments and other purposes will go into effect Oct. 30. Among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of animals. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the revisions `` will partially implement'' amendments to the federal Animal Welfare Act passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> almost four years ago. The amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect laboratory animals from undue pain and stress, tighten enforcement of rules already on the books, and revise the list of definitions needed to carry out the law. Current regulations define standards for animal use, including minimum requirements for handling, housing, feeding, watering, sanitation, ventilation, shelter and veterinary care. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the revisions will make the rules for dogs, cats and non-human primates, including monkeys, more complete and easier to understand. Besides requiring research facilities to create special animal care committees, the new regulations include provisions for veterinary care, and holding facilities and handling. The Animal Welfare Act covers most businesses that buy or sell warm-blooded animals, exhibit them and transport them commercially. Rats, mice, birds, horses and farm animals are not covered by the regulations. An agency spokeswoman, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hinnawy </PERSON>, said there are three parts to the package of regulatory changes. The final decisions announced Wednesday affect only the first and second parts. Part One includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the 1985 amendments, she said. Part Two relates to the identification methods, records, licensing requirements and other details. Part Three, which is still under study by the agency, will include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of animal care _ the space each must have, access to food and water, and other details that affect their routines. <PERSON> El-Hinnawy </PERSON> said she did n't know when <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> might decide on final rules for Part Three. Federal animal welfare legislation was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and covered animal dealers who raised dogs and cats for research and laboratories conducting research on these animals. The coverage was broadened in 1970 to include most other warm-blooded animals used in research, exhibited or sold in the wholesale pet trade. An amendment in 1976 extended to law to include the transportation of live animals.

 Anti-abortion activists say the outcome of a special <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> congressional election is a `` pivotal victory'' in the wake of last month's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on abortion. A leader of the abortion rights movement, however, said Wednesday that ethnic issues, not abortion, fueled state Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s victory over Democrat <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a Republican and the first Cuban-American elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, defeated <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> on Tuesday for the seat left vacant by the death of veteran Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` Ileana could not have won the vote with just the Hispanic vote,'' <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters. `` There is not a majority of Hispanics in the district. `` There had to be other issues involved, and we feel that definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>'s win is a pivotal victory for the pro-life movement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 5-4 ruling July 3, which gave states greater power to limit abortions, appeared on the court's docket as <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said abortion `` was not the issue'' in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> race. `` Nothing was an issue there that could supersede the ethnicity issue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. `` The fact is that no issue, even the issue of choice, could overwhelm the ethnicity issue.'' The district is about 40 percent Hispanic and unofficial returns showed that predominantly Latin precincts had turnouts of more than 60 percent and gave Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> majorities of 80 percent to 90 percent. She carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47 percent margin. During the campaign, Ms. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, 37, said she favored more restrictions on abortion. <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said he favored more choice. However, with polls indicating most voters supported abortion rights, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate said abortion was more of a state legislative issue than a congressional issue. Abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative victories in races in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> indicated movement in their direction in the wake of the court ruling. Ms. <PERSON> Faucher </PERSON>, however, said anti-abortion candidates have won in races in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislative districts. Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> denied that abortion was an important issue in those races.

<HEAD>Sky's-the-Limit Pay Raises Proposed for 500 Top Federal Experts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To compete with universities and industry for the best and the brightest, the government should be able to hire 500 `` world-class'' experts for whatever pay the market demands, a consulting company says. The <ORGANIZATION> Wyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, in what is described as the most comprehensive study of the government's salary system, also recommends supplemental pay for top federal executives in high-cost cities _ <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and its environs and possibly in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The company offered a third idea Wednesday for enabling the government to compete with private enterprise: It wants to let all government agencies pay up to 15 percent above normal salaries to as many as 5 percent to 10 percent of their employees. The proposal to set aside normal pay schedules for the top 500 career posts in government was intended to address a frequently cited problem _ the difficulty of recruiting and retaining officials for jobs requiring rare expertise. Such jobs as running the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, giving scientific direction to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or running federal nuclear facilities often are hard to fill. The government competes with universities and industry for those people. In calling for geographic differentials, the <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> report did n't specify their size, but it would restrict the differentials to professionals and administrators `` in a limited number of high-pay areas. The only ones specified were the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> region, the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities and possibly <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The study said that if all its recommendations were accepted a gap of 14 percent still would exist between what the government pays its 1.4 million white-collar workers and what they could earn in private enterprise. `` Overall, the primary problem is that federal salaries have fallen so far behind the pay offered by other employers that it is difficult to recruit and retain adequately qualified workers in some occupations and locations,'' the report said. `` These problems will become progressively more severe over the next several years.'' As a result of the problem, the company noted, government agencies use `` back door'' methods to reward employees. For example, attempts to provide competitive pay can take the form of `` grade creep,'' in which workers are promoted to higher classifications to get them more money, the report noted. The study was conducted under contract to the Office of Personnel Management. The proposals would cost $ 6 billion to implement and the changes would require congressional approval. Earlier this month, an interagency group from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> put the pay gap for all civilian government workers _ not just white-collar workers _ at 28.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate report Wednesday, agreed with that figure. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Federal Pay last week recommended a pay increase of 10 percent next year to help narrow the gap. `` The bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become a canyon,'' chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duggan </PERSON> said. But on Monday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in accord with an agreement worked out by congressional leaders and administration officials last spring, recommended an increase of 3.6 percent to take effect in January. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide increases of 8 percent to 25 percent to 7,900 top federal and military officials _ 700 political appointees and 7,200 career executives, including top foreign service officials and three-star and four-star admirals and generals. Most senior federal officials would get 25 percent raises, matching the 25 percent increase <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended for judges. Cabinet members would go from $ 99,500 a year to $ 124,400. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the increases were needed `` to address pay deficiencies for employees with exceptional qualifications and to make pay more competitive at the senior levels of government.'' At the same time, the president proposed that all members of the senior executive service _ the top levels of career employees _ be required to undergo re-certification every three years to prove their worth to keep the higher salaries. Upon taking office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed a recommendation by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a 51 percent increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and federal officials. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, bowing to a public outcry, rejected the idea.

 <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Corp. </PERSON> is promising to take steps to protect 8,000 workers in 31 meat-processing plants from injuries caused by repetitive motion and other industry hazards, the government says. The agreement announced Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requires the company to implement the plan within three years It will affect plants in 20 states and is the second such agreement between <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and a major meatpacker in a year. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> also agreed to pay $ 20,000 in fines and drop its appeal of four <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> citations issued in November after an inspection of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Hillshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. Those citations were for willful violations of laws limiting exposure to cumulative trauma disorders `` <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> deserves praise for its willingness to recognize the ergonomic hazards ... in the meat industry and to take positive stops to control those illnesses throughout its many meat processing plants,'' said acting <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> for comment were not successful. A company spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message. The meatpacking industry is considered to be among the nation's most dangerous, with common ailments suffered by workers including loss of digits and carpal tunnel syndrome, a degenerative nerve and muscle disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and often is attributed to repetitive motion The agreement requires <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to employ consultants to review the processes used in its meat plants that expose workers to repetitive motion and other hazards linked to cumulative trauma disorders. If new equipment and other engineering controls can not be used to reduce the potential hazards, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will be required to rotate workers and take other steps to prevent physical fatigue of certain muscles, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. In some cases tests of workers exposed to repetitive motion will be required to determine whether their duties cause muscle deterioration. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> also agreed to develop training programs for its workers, supervisors and plant medical personnel. Proper knife care and usage would be among the topics of training for workers, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agreement is similar to one reached in November between <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in which the meatpacker agreed to implement similar preventive measures at 15 plants.

<HEAD>Ethical Rules Say Parent Can Donate Liver to Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Living donors can ethically give up part of their livers for transplants, but such donations generally should be limited to parents supplying organs for their children, according to guidelines released today. The proposed rules were developed at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, where doctors hope to perform the nation's first such transplant. Transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead are now routine in many large medical centers. But because these organs are in short supply, doctors would like to begin transplanting parts of organs taken from the living. The body has two kidneys, and these are routinely donated to relatives with kidney failure. But because the body has only one liver, this organ can not be entirely removed for transplantation. The new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy person's liver and transplant it into an infant with kidney failure. The donor's missing section of liver eventually grows back, and in the baby, the piece of organ grows along with the child `` We believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and donor, the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a parent as a living donor,'' wrote Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> A. Singer and colleagues. The doctors published the guidelines, which resulted from a year-long series of seminars and discussions, in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. A team led by Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> surgeons hopes to perform the operation this fall. The operation has already been done in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The doctors proposed that the donor should be the child's parent or, in rare cases, a mature sibling or grandparent. They said that when the donor is related to the recipient, the benefits of saving a life are most rewarding. Such transplants also have the best chance of succeeding. One of the child's parents will be asked to sign a consent form that states: `` The operation your child will have ... has never been performed.'' Doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers, up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting transplants.

 Lured like other visitors to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's $ 16 billion a year farm economy As of July, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants, Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales. `` We are being literally swamped,'' said <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, a county entomologist who supplied the statistics. `` The variety of insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.'' Besides the climate, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has become a magnet for imported insects because of the ease of international travel. More than 3.7 million foreigners passed through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last year, and at least some presumably slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, officials said. One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached epidemic proportions in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is racing for the state's agricultural heartland _ the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The city, a hub for commerce with <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, boasts a burgeoning immigrant population with a taste for fruits and vegetables from their native countries. `` They have friends and family who are sending them a taste of home,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, a deputy county agricultural commissioner. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said that although <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s farm production is negligible, the county acts as the entry for pests to the rest of the state _ the nation's leading agricultural producer. He noted that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s belated response to a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago, eventually costing the state $ 100 million to exterminate and farmers $ 100 million in losses. But similar invasions lately have become almost mundane. `` I hate to stress that, because I do n't want people to believe that the bug is any less dangerous,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, three medfly infestations have occurred in the county within the last 12 months, each costing roughly $ 1 million to eradicate and each drawing comparatively scant public attention. The county's budget for plant quarantine last year was more than $ 784,000, an almost 54 percent increase over fiscal year 1977-78, officials said. Treatment methods vary for different types of fruit flies, but early detection is a fundamental strategy, made possible by checking more than 160,000 baited traps set throughout the state. `` It's almost like battling forest fires,'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said. `` It's a lot easier to put it out as soon as it gets started. Discoveries of less notorious pests are charted each month by <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, whose microscopic scrutiny detected five new types of insects in the county last year and three so far this year. Although agriculture officials have established methods of dealing with fruit fly infestations, other kinds of insects can be neither readily identified nor exterminated. One of the most ruinous new pests, the ash whitefly, apparently hitchhiked to the suburban <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It has no natural enemies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and its numbers are exploding. `` It is totally out of control,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` The only thing limiting the population is the number of trees they have to eat. It is expanding as fast as it can, and chemical -LRB- pesticide -RRB- control is just totally not feasible.'' Although fruit flies, which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits and vegetables, are like a cancer, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said the ash whitefly acts more like a low-grade virus. It attaches itself to the underside of leaves and slowly sucks the life out of trees. At first, agriculture officials were unconcerned because they believed the tiny new invader only attacked ornamental trees like the ash, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. But they later discovered the ash whitefly thrives in dozens of varieties of trees, including olive, pear, apple and peach trees. To combat the ash whitefly, agriculture officials have dispatched an entomologist to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to collect several varieties of <LOCATION> Encarsia </LOCATION>, pinhead-sized wasps that are the insect's natural enemy. If tests prove successful, millions of the tiny wasps could be released come winter, though it probably will be years before the wasps can significantly reduce the ash whitefly population.

<HEAD>Doctors Say New Insulin Pump Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A radio-controlled insulin pump implanted in diabetics' abdomens can free them from injections and may more closely mimic the way nature provides the essential hormone, according to a study published today. The pump can be programmed to vary the rate at which it releases insulin. Researchers hope this approach will help diabetics get better control of their blood sugar levels and avoid the disabling complications of their disease, such as blindness and kidney failure. `` It's a significant advance,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saudek </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the pump was developed. `` This is, in my view, the first successful long-term experience with variable-rate implanted insulin pumps.'' Other implanted pumps tested in recent years have been hindered by problems, such as clogged lines. The new pump was tested on 18 diabetics, and doctors said it generally worked well, although four pumps became blocked when tissue grew over the catheter that releases the insulin. One malfunctioned because of a faulty microchip. Doctors can program the pumps to vary the rate at which they release insulin throughout the day. Patients use a hand-held radio transmitter to command the pumps to give out an extra burst of insulin after meals. While blood sugar control with the pumps was good, the doctors said that the best solution eventually may be a pump that senses the body's blood sugar levels and releases insulin as it's needed. An estimated 500,000 diabetic Americans require frequent insulin injections because their bodies fail to make enough of the hormone that breaks down sugar. The new pumps, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> MiniMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were tested by <PERSON> Saudek </PERSON> and other doctors at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. They described the results in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Patients used the pump _ called a programmable implantable medication system, or PIMS _ for all their insulin needs for periods ranging from four months to two years. Except for two who withdrew from the experiment because of blocked catheters, the doctors said that patients `` have been uniformly happy with their pumps.'' The disk-shaped pumps, implanted in patients' abdomens, are 3 inches in diameter and weigh 7 ounces. They hold about 2 -LCB- teaspoons of insulin _ a two-month supply _ and can be refilled with a syringe. The devices have computer memories that will record an hourly history of all insulin released during three weeks. Researchers plan soon to test a slightly modified version of the pump on more patients. `` The expectation is that if these next trials go well, we would then apply to have the pump generally available to the diabetic population,'' <PERSON> Saudek </PERSON> said. The mechanism was based on the design of a device on the Viking space probe that delivered culture medium to Martian soil to see if anything would grow in it.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Legislation Would Mean Higher Electric Costs: Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The utility industry says consumers in many states should be prepared to pay as much as 10 percent more for electricity if legislation to curb acid rain becomes law. The industry contends such legislation will cost more than $ 5.5 billion a year. Environmentalists and analysts at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the industry cost estimates provided Wednesday are too high, but concede the emission curbs required to reduce acid rain will be expensive. `` We're heartened that their numbers are coming out so close to ours,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kete </PERSON>, senior analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of air radiation, when asked about the utility industry figures. She said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated industry costs would be about $ 4 billion a year when full compliance with the proposed acid rain controls go into effect in 2000. The acid rain curbs are included in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tightening federal air pollution laws. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposal calls for cutting annual sulfur dioxide emissions _ the chief source of acid rain _ by 10 million tons, mostly from coal-burning power plants. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> projects industry costs as high as $ 120 billion over a 20-year period as a result of having to install pollution control equipment and make other adjustments to meet the emission curbs required by the legislation. Under some scenarios, costs could jump to as much as $ 7.1 billion a year after 2000, said the industry report, acknowledging that was a `` high-cost'' scenario that envisions failure of the administration's proposed emissions credit trading scheme and broad reliance by utilities on expensive `` scrubber'' technology instead of fuel switching. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kete </PERSON> said the agency continues to believe that utilities will rely less than the industry believes on expensive technology, opt more for switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal, and make the emissions credit system work. All of those factors would bring the industry estimates in line with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> cost estimates, she said. According to the industry study, about 85 percent of the increased costs of complying with the proposed emission curbs would be borne by 15 states in the eastern half of the country where utilities rely heavily on high-sulfur coal to meet their generating needs. Utilities in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> together will face 44 percent of the annual costs nationwide, the industry group said. The other states in the group of 15 are <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The additional costs will result in rate increases of more than 5 percent in 19 states with the sharpest increases _ 10.8 percent to 17.3 percent _ coming in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, according to the industry study. The others states facing rates increases of more than 5 percent were given as: <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, all 6 percent to 9 percent increase; and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, both 5.1 percent to 5.9 percent. Thirty-six of the 100 major utilities will have to impose rate increases of at least 10 percent, the industry group maintained. <PERSON> Kete </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated average rate increases as a result of the additional pollution control requirements at about 2 percent with the highest increases in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, the industry group's senior vice president for energy and environment, said costs could be reduced by as much as 30 percent if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> eliminates provisions for emission caps for individual utilities and changes other restrictions he said are `` unnecessarily expensive.'' `` They're trying to trash the administration's acid rain proposal,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudek </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. He maintained the legislation already is flexible enough to allow utilities `` to pick sensible alternatives'' that meet the proposed emission standards and still hold down costs.

 Owners of a casino could n't make a go of it with a 1950s theme, but they hope to recoup some of their losses by selling off the old-fashioned jukeboxes, neon signs and movie posters that decorated the place. Old Philco television sets, a Seeburg Select-O-Matic 100 jukebox and movie posters for such flicks as `` The She Creature'' will go on sale Saturday alongside green felt tables, one-armed bandits, dice and playing cards from <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>'s Fabulous'50s casino. A 1955 Chevy Belair convertible and car backseats that served as couches also will be on the auction block. `` There's a lot of interest in'50s things, which is why we were kind of surprised the club did n't make,'' casino spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorehe </PERSON> said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, stung by another cancellation from tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, said it is no longer interested in doing business with him. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, who has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled performances with the company this decade, has an inflammed sciatic nerve and is unable to move extensively on stage, manager <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> wrote to the Lyric. `` I think this is going to be very distressing to the ticket holders, that he's not coming,'' <PERSON> Ardis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>, the Lyric's general director, said Wednesday after announcing of the `` ban.'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said in telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he thinks Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>'s reaction is `` a little bit irrational,'' particularly since <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> has raised `` incredible sums of money'' for the Lyric in fund-raising appearances. `` I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of spite for the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which is absolutely wrong,'' said <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>. The Lyric has sold nearly all its 3,550 seats for the season, during which it's celebrating its 35th anniversary. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> was under contract to perform in <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Tosca'' on six dates this fall. `` I did everything possible to try to convince him to fulfill his commitment with us,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>, including a suggestion that he sing his role from a chair. `` His medical problem, while certainly a concern, is apparently not affecting his voice,'' she said. The singer rejected the idea, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>. `` Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>,'' she said. `` I'm not mad or exasperated,'' she said. `` I did n't have any choice. ... `` We have 32,000 subscribers who over the years have accosted me on the street,'' she said. `` A lot of people have been very mad about his cancellations.'' <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s manager wrote that the singer recently was obliged to cancel his engagement at the opera in <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, because of the inflamed sciatic nerve. `` His doctor advises that the therapy will be necessary for two months,'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> wrote. `` So as not to alarm you, this does not mean that <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> can not move or walk, only that he can not subject himself to the rigors of a live operatic performance. `` He can sing as beautifully as ever,'' the manager said. His letter concludes by saying <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> `` looks forward to returning to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> again in 1991.'' Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>, however, said because of the cancellation, the Lyric is not interested in considering any other future engagements with <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has extended for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban Red Dye No. 3 as a cancer-causing food additive.

The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline, which was Wednesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in July passed legislation calling for further study of the dye. The Senate has not yet acted on the legislation. Since 1960, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and other additives have been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market for an additional two years pending further study. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has granted dozens of extensions of the provisional listing.

<TEXT>
 The cozy relationship between private arms sellers and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> is at the heart of a debate over the need for controls on arms merchants and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers who reportedly trained hitmen for Colombian drug lords. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a small country. Everybody who was a colonel or brigadier general in the army has very intimate contacts with the defense establishment,'' said <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, minister of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs in the Cabinet and a right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc member. `` The question is what is the involvement of the defense ministry? It is one of the questions that will be investigated,'' <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said. The left-leaning daily <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in an editorial said it was `` inconceivable that the security establishment did n't know what was going on in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, however, told reporters the ministry did not learn of the training until April when it issued a written warning to the company involved. `` There are those who are not obeying the law. But I believe the number of people who have not obeyed the law ... is very, very limited. Israeli mercenaries are basically non-existent,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, once a senior official in the <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> intelligence service, promised a thorough investigation but expressed skepticism about whether Israelis knowingly helped drug gangs. `` I know our officers, and I can not believe that they would have been involved in such crimes,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Conservatives in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> blocked a move by liberals to tighten existing controls that make it a crime punishable by six months in jail for a reservist to sell weapons or give training without authorization. Urging more control, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Libai </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` It can not be that we train people to kill in the army for the sake of our country, and that later people use it for their own personal profit without any control.'' However, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb <LOCATION> Herzlia </LOCATION>, defended the reservists accused of helping drug kingpins. `` With a wave of their hands, they forgot the 20 years in which you and your friends risked your lives for us all,'' he wrote in an ad in Israeli newspapers. Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, former defense minister and general, criticized the debate over the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> affair. `` There is certainly not one man among us who would want to see Israelis linked to drug deals. But nothing has been proven. Nobody has been tried. We with our own hands are turning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into the one responsible for drugs in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said today. `` We are talking about our army officers. We are talking about people who risked their lives for years, who served the army's best units. What has been proven about them to this day is that they are first-rate fighters. Nothing else,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> added. The close-knit nature of the relationship between officialdom and private arms merchants shows up in the `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Defense Sales Directory.'' The ministry's annual catalogue lists government arms makers side-by-side with private companies that arrange sales of weapons or services. Among the companies is Hod HaHanit -LRB- Spearhead -RRB-, which describes itself as `` specializing in fighting terrorism by establishing and training anti-terror units, internal security and intelligence forces ... presidential guard units and VIP security.'' The company is headed by reserve Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who associates say was once an instructor in a parachute course headed by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief of staff. Former commander of an elite anti-terror unit, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> is the focus of a police probe of the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> affair in which six former officers have been questioned so far. At one point, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> threatened to blow the whistle on other high-ranking officers and at least one member of parliament who he sugggested were involved in unauthorized arms dealings in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Two right-wing members of parliament, <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rehavam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeevi </PERSON>, said they had been in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on arms-related business but only with government authorization. <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, a military historian and journalist, said in an interview that the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> affair was an outgrowth of too close a relationship between those still in uniform and their retired army buddies. `` The crux of the issue is the social relationship between those who are now in power and those who do a job overseas. They are friends. They say, ` I know this guy. He's not going to deal in something to do with narcotics.' So they believe there is no need to formalize ways of control,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Many Israelis, especially conservatives, argue that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was only marketing skills it had honed in repeated wars with the Arabs. `` It's a central fact that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has something that people want,'' <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafets </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> director, said in an interview. `` It's no more exceptional than people who want to buy Saudi oil or Swiss watches. It just happens to be what we've got to export.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arms exports have totaled more than $ 1 billion since the mid-1980s. A reported $ 350 million in <LOCATION> Kfir </LOCATION> warplanes, Galil rifles, communications equipment and other hardware has gone to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the past decade.

 <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, the queen of a $ 5 billion empire who stood accused of even billing $ 8 worth of underwear as a business expense, showed no emotion upon her conviction of evading $ 1.2 million in federal income taxes. After Wednesday's verdict, juror <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the jury decided to acquit Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> of the most serious charge, conspiracy to commit extortion, because they were unclear on what constituted extortion. `` A lot of the people thought that you had to get your legs broken to get extorted and this sounded mild,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` There were a number of jurors who felt very uncomfortable with the definition.'' The charge, which carried a 20-year sentence, alleged that the 69-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her aide, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, conspired to extort payoffs and goods from vendors doing business with the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization _ which has far-flung real estate holdings, including some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most luxurious hotels. After a two-month trial and five days of deliberation, the jurors convicted Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> of 33 of 41 counts, including conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, tax evasion and other tax fraud charges. Her co-defendants, former aides <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, were convicted of assisting in the tax-evasion scheme. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> also was acquitted of extortion conspiracy. All three were acquitted on mail fraud charges. Each of the 33 counts against Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> carry a maximum prison term of three or five years. She also could be fined nearly $ 8 million. Sentencing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was scheduled for Nov. 14. Interviews of 15 prominent lawyers by <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Lawyer magazine about <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s sentencing reputation indicated that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was unlikely to avoid prison. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, described as a persnickety `` queen'' in <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotel ads, was depicted at the trial as arrogant, penny-pinching and mean-spirited. Even her own lawyer described her as `` a tough bitch.'' After listening to the litany of guilty verdicts, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> _ a one-time <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> cigarette girl and successful model _ sat in the courtroom and conferred with lawyers and family for an hour. She then left the courthouse by the front steps, where she was surrounded by hundreds of photographers, camera crews, reporters and bystanders. She got into a limousine and departed without comment, even as she was taunted by some. `` How do you feel, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>?'' one shouted. `` Inquiring peasants want to know.'' On <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> called the hoopla surrounding the trial `` sickening'' after he read newspapers a friend saved for him. `` The whole thing has been a sickening experience _ the press, the television, the people on the street,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, said the conviction would be appealed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said the convictions were a deterrent to anyone considering cheating on their taxes. `` It's an opportunity to remind the public, and we need reminding every now and then, that the law applies equally to everyone,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, still face prosecution on a state indictment alleging evasion of state taxes. No trial date has been set. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, was charged in the April 1988 federal indictment but was not tried because the judge found him mentally incompetent. In finding Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> guilty, the jury decided she had evaded $ 1.2 million in taxes, most of it by billing $ 3.1 million in expenses for the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion to the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> business. Prosecutors also charged that $ 320,172 in Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s personal purchases _ including thousands of dollars in designer clothing and $ 8 for underwear _ were charged to the Park Lane Hotel, one of several <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> hotels in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Many of the 44 prosecution witnesses added to the harsh personal portrait. They described how she fired employees at the slightest provocation, disputed bills and always sought the lowest price. Her former housekeeper testified that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> once told her: `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> sought to discredit the witnesses as disgruntled ex-employees. He argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> did nothing wrong in billing their companies for part of their mansion expenses because they used the estate for business.

 Exiled black nationalist leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> is resting comfortably following a brain spasm earlier this month that left him partially paralyzed, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to make a full recovery, an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who refused to be named said Wednesday. <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, 71-year-old leader of the largest guerrilla organization fighting the white-led government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has been in exile since <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was banned by <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> in 1960.

<TEXT>
 The three denominations that merged last year into the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> proved this week in their first national legislative assembly that they could work well together, leaders said. `` The predominant spirit by far was one I would characterize as a strong mixture of joy and commitment,'' the church's president, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, told reporters at the end of the assembly Wednesday. He said the 1,041 delegates demonstrated `` that it was right for us to be together.'' The 5.3-million-member denomination was formed by the combination of the largely eastern and urban <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the largely midwestern and rural <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. The diverse composition resulted in some difficult debates on social concerns. In the final session, the assembly adopted resolutions urging support for striking Appalachian coal miners and charging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with abuse of Palestinians. The assembly also supported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to pressure it to end apartheid. Not everyone was happy about the nation's fourth-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination entering such political matters. It's a `` political sideshow'' sugggesting church people `` have a telephone line to God,'' protested the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION> `` It's pointless and ineffective.'' He said it `` abandoned faith for a political gospel.'' Bishop <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, defended the apartheid resolution, saying, `` It's clear support for the cause of justice.'' Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazareth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said it was demanded by `` the whole word of God.'' `` The Lord we proclaim is the word of God,'' he said. `` We do have a political law which is part of God's holy word.'' The legislative sessions were preceded and followed by worship, hymns and Bible study. <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said the assembly's overwhelming decisions to be part of two major ecumenical bodies, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churces </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, were signs of maturity. He also said he was impressed with the diverse makeup of the delegates, who included blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians although the church is predominantly white. `` Historically I think we are the first church constructed with a mandate to become more inclusive,'' he said. Of the church's demand that its pension board rapidly get rid of an estimated $ 85 million in stocks in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said: `` Setting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pensions </ORGANIZATION>.'' But he added, `` We are 100 percent agreed that apartheid must be dismantled.'' In the Israeli-Palestinian matter, the church confessed past `` sinful complicity'' against Jews, but said peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> demanded an end to `` abuses against Palestinians,'' along with self-determination for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, delegate, M.B. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, unsuccessfully sought elaboration of `` Lutheran complicity in 400 years of persecution, terror and formation of anti-Jewish attitudes.'' The added self-criticism was not included, but the Rev. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Imhoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged sensitivity on that matter in church educational material, saying some in the past `` tends to be anti-Semitic.'' The Lutherans also passed a resolution of concern for about 2,000 coal miners striking against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which has sought to impose contract concessions it says it needs to compete abroad. The Rev. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wardensville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, called the situation a `` model of colonialism that oppresses its own people,'' and urged `` something to alleviate human suffering.

<HEAD>Study: Overweight Kids' Blood Pressures Sensitive to Salt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When overweight youngsters switch from high-salt to low-salt diets, their blood pressures fall dramatically, but the change in food has no effect on normal-size youngsters, a study published today shows. The work suggests that fat youngsters are more susceptible to the damaging effects of a high-salt diet. This helps explain why overweight people are especially prone to get high blood pressure. Doctors have long known that people who lose weight also lower their blood pressure. The latest work shows that mild sodium restriction also results in a significant drop in blood pressure, even when people remain overweight. `` In this study, we found that the blood pressure of obese adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake, whereas the blood pressure of non-obese adolescents is not,'' the researchers wrote. They theorized that overweight people get high blood pressure because their bodies are less efficient at getting rid of salt. The study was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocchini </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers studied 60 obese and 18 normal youngsters who ranged from age 10 to 16. They spent two weeks on a high-salt diet and two weeks on a low-salt diet. At the start of the study, the overweight youngsters' blood pressures were 19 points higher than the normal children's. After the low-salt regimen, the obese youngsters' fell 12 points, while the normal children's rose one. Thirty-six of the overweight children went on weight-loss diets and dropped an average of 17 pounds. At the lower weights, their blood pressures were no longer sensitive to salt.

<TEXT>
 Americans in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are edgy about the drug traffickers' retaliatory campaign against the government but few say they sense any imminent personal danger. Nonetheless, some are packing their bags. `` I love <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but I just ca n't live here right now,'' <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, who has lived in the country 18 years, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. She said other factors contributed to her decision to leave next week with her three daughters, but that the latest wave of violence `` just topped it off.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday recommended that Americans in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> leave the country to avoid being caught up in the violence. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> ordered the evacuation of all embassy dependents, apparently for fear of becoming the targets of the ruthless cocaine cartels. Traffickers are lashing out because of a government anti-narcotics offensive that has included a nationwide manhunt and the confiscation of more than $ 200 million in drug barons' property. Part of the campaign, sparked by the Aug. 18 assassination of popular presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, included renewal of an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Traffickers are known to greatly fear extraditon to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, married to a Colombian, said she planned to spend a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with her daughters. Her husband, an economist with a private company in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, plans to stay behind for now but will look into job possibilities in the States, she said. She said she felt no direct threat, but admitted the tension of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> `` gets really tiring.'' A change of scene would also be welcome, she said. `` I'd like to see something different for a year,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. `` Who knows? I may be back in a year. It may be too quiet for me over there.'' At <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, summer vacation ended Tuesday. On the first day of classes, all students were assembled and the headmaster told them to assure their parents special security measures were being taken. One teacher said the measures included constant contact between the school, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> mayor's office; strict measures to keep unauthorized people off campus and checks on any cars parked on the school's perimeter. The school has always employed guards and watchmen. `` The teachers are all there working with confidence and calm and without fear,'' she said, asking not to be identified by name. `` We do n't feel any particular threat to Americans.'' `` On the other hand, there are n't many of us left,'' she added. Of the school's 1,400 students, less than 10 percent are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, she noted. The American community shrank dramatically in late 1984, when extradition of drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began. Angry cocaine cartel bosses threatened to kill five Americans for every dealer who was extradited to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for trial. A bomb exploded outside the downtown <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, killing a female Colombian passer-by. Hundreds of Americans fled to the States, many of them executives in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that before the drug violence had been frequent targets of the country's well-entrenched leftist guerrilla organizations. Some eventually trickled back. But many returned only long enough to pack their furniture. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> then established its policy of barring dependents under 18 years of age. Recalling those frightening times, the oft-repeated refrain among those who remain now is: It's been worse. `` There's been many incidents over the last few years,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who works for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drilling company. `` To me this is just one of many.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> makes regular forays into the guerrilla-plagued jungles of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s oil-producing region. Extremist kidnappings of Americans are not unknown. `` I'm concerned for the family, the children being out in public,'' he said. It's not the fear of being a target, but of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he said. `` Indiscriminate bombing kills a lot of people.'' About the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggestion that they abandon the country, he said: `` I'll have to talk it over with my wife.'' An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman, interviewed on condition she not be identified, said she wanted to let relatives at home know that `` there's not a state of civil disorder. `` We're still getting stuck in traffic jams, we still have to go to the grocery store. We still pay the electric bill.''

The dollar closed at 144.28 yen, up 1.20 yen from Wednesday's close It opened at 144.33 yen and ranged between 144.15 yen and 144.45 yen.

<TEXT>
 A former textile worker was executed for raping and murdering the 61-year-old woman he stabbed 42 times with a butcher knife in her farmhouse 12 years ago. <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>, 34, was put to death in the electric chair at the State Penitentiary late Wednesday. The sentence was carried out following a day of appeals that ended with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voting 7-2 against postponement. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who oppose the death penalty under all circumstances, voted for a reprieve. Earlier, Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> denied clemency for <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was baptized Tuesday night, and took communion before the execution. In a final statement, he said: `` I would express that what is about to take place is a murder. I do n't hate anyone. I forgive everyone involved.'' <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was convicted of murdering <PERSON> Lavergne </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a widow who authorities testified had been beaten beyond recognition when her nude body was found in a bathtub in 1977. She had been bitten as well as stabbed, and the killer had poured laundry bleach on the body, according to testimony. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> argued that <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> should have been spared the death penalty because he is borderline mentally retarded. Defense attorneys offered new evidence showing brain damage and diminished mental capacity. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, a lawyer from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told an appeals panel that <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was deprived of an adequate psychiatric evaluation when he was tried in 1978. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Linwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> argued that the defense should have raised such objections earlier. <PERSON> Waye </PERSON> was the eighth person to be put to death in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since the state resumed executions in 1982, and the 117th nationwide since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to resume capital punishment in 1976. About 50 opponents of the death penalty held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night outside the prison, and about 20 supporters of capital punishment gathered on a sidewalk across the street. `` As far as the victim goes, I have sympathy for the family, but as far as the guy goes, I believe people can change,'' said <PERSON> Mirella </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, 24, who was at the vigil with her 2 -LCB- - year-old daughter Across the street, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> said: `` You ca n't let them get away with murder. If I committed a crime like he did, I would deserve to die.'' Sue Stone of <LOCATION> Lunenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, who was a close friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, said she had had no reaction to <PERSON> Waye </PERSON>'s execution. `` With anyone being killed the way she was, you never get over it,'' she said by telephone. `` You try to come to terms with it through the years. We were very, very close, and for a person as good as she was ... a religious woman, a gentle woman, it's hard to accept.''

<HEAD>Report: Dean Said Reagan Aides Used Influence at HUD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official told a federal grand jury that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides repeatedly tried to intervene in an urban renewal program touted as immune to political influence, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In October testimony, the official, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, suggested <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides may have promoted the use of multimillion-dollar grants for politically attractive projects of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. The Times said the testimony offers a clear indication of White House ties to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s grant-selection process and apparently opens new avenues of inquiry for investigators in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who are examining other programs for possible abuse. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> implied, and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials interviewed this week agreed, that the contacts were proper, and prosecutors who have reviewed <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s actions have not alleged any wrongdoing, the Times said. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, executive assistant to former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from 1984-87, has refused to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, citing the Fifth Amendment. The appearance before the grand jury, sitting in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, was several months before <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> became a central figure in allegations of influence peddling and political favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The Times obtained a transcript of the grand jury testimony. A lawyer for <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, told the Times her statements and other recently disclosed evidence `` establish beyond doubt that Miss <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was not an independent operator, but rather was acting under direction and with authorization.'' Two officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House told the Times they had asked <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to give close attention to specific grant applicants but said the contacts were routine and that the White House never ordered <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to finance the projects. According to the transcript, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said politics was discussed in awarding money under the Urban Development Action Grants program, that lawmakers often contacted her to promote projects for the program and that the White House intervened in at least one-quarter of the successful grant applicants. The grand jury was investigating allegations of local corruption involving <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money and a hotel project in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> acknowledged in her testimony that a grant awarded to <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> in 1987 probably would not have been approved without a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> request that it be given special attention. `` Before, you could pretty much have guessed <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, would not get a UDAG,'' she said. The grand jury investigation led to the indictment of a former <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> mayor, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessey </PERSON>, on charges he conspired to divert $ 160,000 of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant. The mayor is now on trial in federal court in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Study: The Fatter You Are, the Higher Your Risk of Gallstones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Obese women are six times more likely than normal-size women to get gallstones, but being even slightly overweight increases the risk, a study published today concludes. Although researchers have long known that overweight people are more likely to get gallstones, the new results show that the problem gets progressively worse as women grow fatter. `` These data suggest that even a slight excess of weight may be an important determinant of the increased risk of gallstones in middle-aged women,'' wrote the study's authors. The analysis, conducted by Dr. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclure </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, was based on a health survey of 88,837 female nurses. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. About 475,000 Americans undergo surgery each year for painful gallstones, and the problem is twice as common among women as men. The study shows that middle-age women's risk of gallstones increases if they put on weight during their middle years. It also linked the disease with teen-age obesity. The researchers assembled their statistics by computing women's relative weight _ their weight divided by the square of their height Women whose relative weights were more than 32 kilograms per square meter were six times more likely to have gallstone disease than were those whose relative weights were below 20. For those who were slightly overweight _ relative weights of 24 _ the gallstone risk was 70 percent higher than for trim women. Drinking alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of gallstones.

<HEAD>Racial Tension High, Some Violence After Funeral Services for Vineland

<DATELINE>NEWFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As racial tension and violence continued over the fatal shooting of a black man by police, about 200 people gathered for the victim's funeral and heard a prayer he wrote pleading for a better life. Community leaders in <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> had hoped the violence that followed Sunday night's shooting had subsided, but unrest continued late Wednesday and four more people were arrested. Hour earlier, mourners packed into <ORGANIZATION> Truth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Newfield </LOCATION> for the two-hour ceremony and listened to a reading of the prayer written by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> shortly before his death. He called it `` A Letter to the Lord.'' `` My Father, bless me so I can bless my family and do better,'' the 26-year-old <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wrote. `` Help.'' Before the service, <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> met with community leaders to defuse the unrest. He said an eight-member special task force was formed to find a way to restore calm in the southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> city. `` We're hoping this will be the first step,'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping that we can be assured there wo n't be any more outbreaks.'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said 32 people have been arrested since Monday night, when some 200 people threw rocks and bottles at stores lining the city's main drag In Wednesday's violence, a WPVI-TV news crew from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was attacked by youths as they interviewed people in downtown <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>, where the rioting and looting first broke out Monday, said city spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON>. Reporter <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was listed in stable condition at <ORGANIZATION> Newcomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> with a broken nose and facial injuries. <PERSON> Hie </PERSON> wallet and some television equipment were stolen. The equipment was returned later, <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said. One man allegedly involved in the attack was arrested on assault and robbery charges, and three other people were arrested in a separate incident after they refused police orders to leave the area, <PERSON> Tofanelli </PERSON> said. At the service, <PERSON> Jynell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an educational coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, read <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' letter. `` I feel so ashamed of the way I let you down,'' it said. `` Father, please have mercy on me. I feel so lost in a life of drugs. I was doing the same thing too many years.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a father of two children, was shot after he allegedly threatened Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> with a steel rod, according to police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was wanted on drug and weapons charges, was spotted by officers after police received an anonymous telephone tip about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. After officers told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> he was under arrest, he picked up the rod and approached <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, swinging, <PERSON> Cassisi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON>, who is white, fired two shots at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, hitting him both times, the police chief said. <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> has been taken off street duty and put on special assignment. The mayor said he had no intention of following the demands of some blacks who want <PERSON> Letizia </PERSON> suspended without pay pending the outcome of an investigation.

<HEAD>Israeli Dies of Firebomb Wounds, Sharon Calls for Killing Masked
Youths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An Israeli tax collector died today of injuries suffered in a firebomb attack by Palestinian assailants in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a hospital spokeswoman said. Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, meanwhile, suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> consider legalizing the killing of masked Palestinians without checking whether they are armed. He said the masked youths are the ringleaders behind slayings in the 20-month-old uprising. In another development, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said a Palestinian teen-ager died of wounds suffered in a clash four days ago with soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the body of a 28-year-old Palestinian was found in a pushcart with stab wounds, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The man, whose name was not given, was believed to have been slain as a suspected collaborator with the Israeli authorities, raising the number of such Arab deaths in the uprising to 101. The army said it was investigating the circumstances of the slaying. An army spokesman said the military was investigating a possible link between a stoning attack in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> two weeks ago and the death of a reservist soldier at his home on Wednesday. In northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a Soviet-made <LOCATION> Katyusha </LOCATION> rocket fired from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> slammed into a home on Wednesday night, breaking most of its windows but causing no injury, the army said. Northern Commander Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said the attack appeared to be the work of the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem movement <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would retaliate if the attacks continued. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, 19-year-old <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Agha </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> of head injuries suffered in a clash with troops on Aug. 27, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The reports quoted family as saying <PERSON> Al-Agha </PERSON> had been beaten by troops. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating the circumstances. The tax collector, <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaken </PERSON>, 34, died at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of breathing complications after suffering burns on 70 percent of his body in the Aug. 14 firebombing, spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zaken </PERSON> was one of four Israelis injured in the attack by Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> on a vehicle carrying Israeli civilian employees of the military government. His death raised to 39 the number of Israelis killed in the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied territories. Palestinian deaths have totalled 554. Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said soldiers had apprehended a suspect in the firebomb attack, identified as <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, and that his family was appealing army orders to demolish their home as punishment. Army and police investigators were conducting an autopsy today to determine whether a man identified as <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaharabani </PERSON>, 38, found dead at home Wednesday, died as a result of a stoning attack. The Haaretz daily and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shaharabani </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Herzliya </LOCATION>, received hospital treatment after being hit in the head by a stone while serving as a reserve soldier in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> two weeks ago. After the incident, <PERSON> Shaharabani </PERSON> complained repeatedly of headaches and vomiting, his family was quoted as saying. Police believed the stoning may have caused the symptoms and his death, according to the reports. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, home to about 35,000 Palestinians, has been a frequent scene of protests against Israeli rule. Two soldiers were injured by rocks in the town on Wednesday, and 11 Palestinians were reported wounded when soldiers opened fire at the stone throwers. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, made his comment about killing masked men in a speech broadcast on army radio. He said the key activists in the uprising wore masks during attacks. `` They are people who are acting, murdering. They must be liquidated and if the law does n't allow this, then we must take care so the law will allow it,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said. He added, `` There is no possibility of checking every masked person to see if he is or is n't carrying weapons. These are people who are conducting murders. This is what must be done.''

 The leader of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest opposition party said in an interview published today that if she became prime minister she would ban <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said such a policy might force the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to abandon many of its operations in the <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and it quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials as saying it could damage the alliance between the nations. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as telling the newspaper that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had pledged to consult with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before carrying nuclear weapons into its territory, and that it was time to enforce the agreement. The popular Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> could become prime minister if the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> loses its control of parliament in an upcoming general election and the Socialists are able to forge a coalition with other opposition parties. `` Once the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has promised, it must observe its promise,'' the Morning Herald quoted her as saying. `` It is a matter of principle. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must face up to its responsibilities and hold diplomatic negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can not admit, from any country, ships carrying nuclear weapons.'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said she was prepared to pursue the policy even if it denied the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> the ability to operate in the parts of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has ignored its pledge and routinely carries nuclear weapons into Japanese territory on ships. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to publicly confirm or deny whether its ships carry nuclear weapons. Such a policy has affected its relations with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, which has denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships suspected of carrying nuclear warheads entry to its ports. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> quoted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat as saying a policy such as the one promoted by Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> would have a `` tremendous impact on our strategic posture'' and would be `` tantamount to an abrogation of the Japan-U.S. security treaty.'' It quoted a Japanese defense official as saying the change would `` produce a breakdown in the Japan-U.S. relationship and be a very serious source of instability in the region.'' Neither official was identified. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the only nation to have suffered atomic attacks, maintains a policy of not manufacturing, storing or allowing nuclear weapons to be introduced into the country.

 A carpenter said he is bitter after spending 18 months in jail for having oral sex with his wife and maintained his five-year sentence for violating <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s sodomy law was an unfair result of a domestic dispute. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, 35, left the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday afternoon after <ORGANIZATION> DeKalb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> granted a motion to free him on his own recognizance pending appeal or dismissal of the charges. Sodomy, even between consenting married adults, is a felony in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> under a 156-year-old law recently upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sure, I'm bitter,'' <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> said after being released. He said faith in humankind kept his spirits up, adding, `` I knew someone would see this thing as it really was.'' He said he will contact the carpenters' union about a job as soon as possible. The state, he said, gave him $ 25, `` I guess to start my life over.'' The case against <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> began when <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, his common-law wife of four years, complained to authorities in February 1988 that he had raped and forcibly sodomized her. The couple has since divorced. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> denied ever using force to have sex, saying, `` I only did what she wanted me to do and then she used it against me to get custody of the kids.'' He said he was granted no rights to visit his sons. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> was acquitted of rape and forcible sodomy. But in testifying in his own defense, he admitted on the stand that he had had oral sex with Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The jury found him guilty of sodomy without aggravation, a lesser charge that means oral or anal sex with consent. Some jurors later expressed shock when <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison. He is believed to be the first person convicted under the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law violates constitutional rights to privacy. He accused prosecutors of hypocrisy for ignoring his request that they disqualify themselves if they ever had engaged in oral sex. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON>, a senior assistant attorney general representing the state, argued that privacy was not the issue because the wife made the criminal complaint. `` It's not a matter of police peeking in windows. That's not what is before this court,'' she argued.

 Game show host and animal rights crusader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> has been slapped with a $ 10 million libel lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> director. The action, filed in Superior Court Wednesday, contends <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> and other animal rights organizations conducted a two-year campaign to ruin the reputation of the association and its regional director <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The lawsuit claims <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> falsely stated on radio shows that the association allowed muzzling of two dogs and approved a fight between the animals on the film `` The Tender,'' which would have been illegal. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> also claimed the association lied on its reports of an investigation of cruelty against chimpanzees during production of the film `` Project X,'' the lawsuit says. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> denied the allegations. `` If this suit results in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public becoming more aware of the extent of animal cruelty in entertainment then the suit will have served a very valuable purpose and it will be well worth the money and the time it costs me,'' he said. The lawsuit accuses <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and its executive director, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnet </PERSON>, of libel, slander, trade libel, interference with prospective business relations, conspiracy and false-light invasion of privacy, association attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said. `` No one is saying Mr. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> is n't an animal rights activist,'' <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We're only saying he has other things on his schedule than the protection of animal rights.'' A separate claim was filed against the city and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>. Rush for allegedly assisting <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in the campaign, <PERSON> Langberg </PERSON> said. `` I have n't even seen it,'' said <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, `` but the conduct of this office in the past has been beyond <LOCATION> reproach </LOCATION> and it is currently beyond reproach. The claim will be discussed with the city attorney and a response will be made.'' Telephone calls to Ms. <PERSON> Burnet </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activists </ORGANIZATION> seeking comment were met with repeated busy signals. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said it was unfortunate the situation resulted in a lawsuit, since both parties want to protect animals. `` It is sad, and it has wasted a lot of our time. But we are not the ones doing the attacking,'' she said. `` We've been trying to get our work done. We did n't want to take it this far, but these have been vicious attacks.'' The association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals and children, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> regional office has been active in protecting animals in the entertainment industry. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, longtime host of the television game show `` The Price Is Right,'' said he has never been sued before. In 1987 he won the highest award given by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. That same year he quit after 19 years as host of the Miss USA Pageant because contestants wore fur coats.

<HEAD>Chinese Posing as Vietnamese Refugees Arriving in Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said today that at least 86 of the nearly 2,000 boat people who have arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the last three months were Chinese job-seekers posing as Vietnamese. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said its <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> bureau director, in a meeting today with a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> embassy official, asked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to investigate the matter and take measures to stop the illegal entries of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Foreign Ministry said Japanese immigration officials determined that at least two of the 86 were carrying fake Vietnamese birth certificates. Ministry officials said 1,919 boat people have arrived on 14 vessels, many of them barely seaworthy, since May. That figure contrasts sharply with the 219 refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> who arrived in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in all of 1988 On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> issued its first deportation order for Chinese who came to the country pretending to be refugees from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The first order was for <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiming </PERSON>, 30, who admitted he boarded a Vietnamese refugee boat in hopes of finding a job in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Daian </PERSON>, spokeman of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s immigration office in <LOCATION> Fukuoka </LOCATION>, on the southernmost main island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>. Xu, considered an illegal immigrant, was among six Chinese discovered among 107 Vietnamese who arrived in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> aboard a wooden boat on May 29, <PERSON> Daian </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would tighten screening of the boat people to cope with the refugee problem. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has decided it will accept only refugees from political persecution, and not economic migrants, but officials say details of the screening policy remain to be worked out.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today blamed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for the failure of the Cambodian peace conference and questioned whether its rival would make good on a promise to pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September. The monthlong international conference ended Wednesday night in the French capital without an agreement to halt fighting among <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-installed government and three guerrilla factions, which united as a coalition for negotiations at the conference. The delegates from 19 countries and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agreed to suspend the meeting and come back when the warring parties were more willing to compromise. Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of the coalition and one of its three factions, called for patience in ending the 19 years of fighting in his nation. Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the three resistance groups, for sabotaging the negotiations. He predicted it would begin a new round of killing after the Vietnamese troops pull out. `` They are striving for victory on the battlefield and did not have the slightest intention of striving for a political arrangement,'' he said Wednesday. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which backs the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the stalled negotiations on `` the intransigence of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> authorities,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Despite the lack of an accord, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will complete the withdrawal of its 26,000 troops by Sept. 27 as planned, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON> as saying in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did not believe that. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> showed no sincerity at the conference,'' <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said. The main obstacle was the insistence by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> be barred from any future coalition government The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of three guerrilla forces, is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of deaths during its fanatical rule from 1975 to 1978, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded the country. Foreign ministers <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the chairmen of the conference, said they will begin consultations within six months with the Cambodian factions in hopes of reconvening the meeting. `` We will come back to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said. `` The problem is complicated. We must be patient.''

 The love of horses that initially drew Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> together was n't enough to sustain their marriage after 15 years. The 39-year-old daughter of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and her 40-year-old husband both remain involved in the equestrian world but have drifted apart in the past decade, with rumors of marital troubles surfacing repeatedly since 1981. Once the most unpopular of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royals, the queen's only daughter has become one of its greatest assets, admired for her charity work, including grueling travels to visit children in poor, war-torn Third World countries. Never at ease with royal duties, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has devoted himself to farming and various equestrian-related business interests including his own equestrian center in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and schools for young riders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and overseas. They have been spending up to half the year apart. On their 15th wedding anniversary Nov. 15, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> attended a Buckingham Palace ball while <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> was giving riding lessons in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. When news of their separation was reported Wednesday night, he was at their <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> home estate in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and she was more than 3,000 miles away in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> attending an International Olympic Committee meeting. Their marriage at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 14, 1973, watched by more than 500 million television viewers, climaxed the storybook romance of a dashing commoner and a headstrong princess. She had already made headlines in the swinging'60s for wearing mini-skirts and dancing onstage with the cast of the rock musical `` Hair.'' A captain in The Queen's Dragoon Guards, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> met <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> in 1968 at a dinner for the British Olympic riding team, and both have been in equestrian teams at the Olympics. Their relationship became serious in 1972. Both went on to win riding championships, and two children were born _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, now 11, and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>, 8. By the late 1970s, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> had the reputation of being rude and intolerant, fonder of horses than people. Tabloid newspapers labeled the princess `` Her Royal Haughtiness.'' The image began to thaw in 1982 with her tour on behalf of the Save the Children Fund to seven African countries and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Impressed by her courage, knowledge and appetite for hard work, the newspapers switched to headlines about `` The Caring Princess.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> joined his wife on some of her early overseas visits, but as the years passed, he was rarely with her in public. In a Sunday Express interview last year, he said accompanying <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> had `` become easier over the years, but I would n't say I find it easy.'' Describing himself as `` quiet and shy,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said farming was his passion, and he spoke with delight about planting thousands of trees and trying to save wildlife. Possessed of a biting wit, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> says she never wanted to be the prettiest, sweetest or most loved of the royals, preferring to do something constructive for others. `` I did n't match up to the public's idea of a fairy princess in the first place,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Now the busiest member of the royal family after her mother, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> is president or patron of more than 75 charities ranging from disabled riders to prison workers, plus 23 military groups and six trade guilds. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tabloids have tried to link <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> to a former bodyguard, to actor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and most recently to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, a handsome aide to the queen who wrote her personal letters which were stolen and sent to a newspaper. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> has been linked by the tabloids to one of his stable girls, a Canadian public relations executive, and most recently to a former Miss <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> have been at pains to preserve the children's privacy They attend private schools, and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> has refused to accept any titles for them.

 Syrian and Christian forces battled with artillery and tanks around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, killing two people and wounding 16, police said. A pro-Iranian Moslem cleric was quoted as calling for the kidnapping of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> if the pontiff visits the beleaguered Christians. The casualties raised the toll since March to at least 807 killed and 2,334 wounded. More than 90 percent of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million population has fled the ravaged city since the latest round of fighting began. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Sunni Moslem fundamentalists, was quoted as saying in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Ad-Diyar daily that Moslem zealots also should kidnap President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to halt alleged <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> aid to the Christians. `` If the pope comes to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and we manage to hold him for the sake of salvaging Palestine, I would n't be against such an act,'' said <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON>, the only Sunni cleric in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to support Shiite Moslem <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s ally. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fanatics carried out suicide bombings against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, French and Israeli forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> between 1983 and 1985, killing hundreds of servicemen, and have kidnapped scores of Westerners. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said Aug. 19 that he intended to visit <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to help end the country's 14-year-old civil war. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has said the final decision on a trip depends on security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` I support the abduction of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and ... <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> to serve the purpose of ousting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and stopping the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> intervention and the naval warships that came to rescue <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s children in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> said He was referring to six French warships in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sent to evacuate French citizens if the fighting worsens. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Moslem allies charge that the French, who ruled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> from 1918 to 1943 and have traditionally been the Christians' protector, plan a military intervention to aid the Christians besieged in their enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Fighting has raged since March 8 between the Syrian army and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said Syrian gunners deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the mountains south and east of the capital today hammered the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave with 20 shells a minute. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, using U.S.-made 155mm howitzers, shelled Syrian positions along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, the waterfront in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the wooded <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> hills southeast of the capital, the spokesman said. Ad-Diyar, which is close to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said the shelling escalated late Wednesday because a peace mission by <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>'s was collapsing over differences involving a proposed halt in arms deliveries to both sides. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said he wants international guarantees that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will stop providing its allies with weapons. The Moslems demand the formation of an inter-Lebanese committee to monitor arms deliveries to ensure that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> does not get shipments from his main backer, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, has refused to pull its forces out. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has launched a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out, charging that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> abrogated the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate by siding with the Moslems. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> ended two days of talks with Lebanese leaders Wednesday and was expected to travel to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>.

 The trial of a woman charged with shooting her lover after a stormy 11-year lesbian relationship may eventually hinge on whether testimony about the so-called battered spouse syndrome is allowed. That decision could come next week in a murder trial that attorneys for both sides believe is one of the first to test that defense in a homosexual relationship. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 30, is charged with first-degree murder. Her attorney said Wednesday she was beaten and tormented for years before she fired a single shot from a .38 caliber pistol at the head of <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, 32, after a Halloween party last year. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said he plans to introduce expert testimony at Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> trial that she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in self-defense. `` It's the first case that I'm aware of where the battered syndrome is used with lesbians,'' said assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> felt like a mother to Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s teen-age twin daughters and that kept her from ending the relationship which culminated in the Oct. 30, 1988, slaying. `` For 11 years, she was the mother of -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>'s -RRB- twins and performed the domestic duties of the relationship,'' <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said Wednesday during a break in the first day of testimony. `` She was frequently battered and abused physically and psychologically, along with the children. When determining if she acted reasonable, you can look at those 11 years.'' <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> is expected to rule next week on whether or not to allow experts to testify about battered spouse syndrome. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says he'll challenge any attempt to bring the syndrome into the case because he says there are no studies about such a defense in homosexual relationships. The prosecution maintains that Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was killed while she was in the closet of the mobile home the women shared in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> was down on her knees in the closet begging for her life,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told jurors in his opening statement Tuesday. Jurors on Wednesday viewed a taped interview police had with Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> just hours after the shooting. The women had just returned from a party where they had been drinking when an argument erupted and Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> pulled out her gun from the closet, Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand because she thought Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> would kill her. `` I was afraid,'' she said. `` There was a point I thought she was going to shoot me and I just ran into her'' and grabbed the gun. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said she did n't recall firing the weapon or what happened to the knife. But in a subsequent taped interview also played to jurors Wednesday, she confessed to police. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> could face life in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last about a week.

<HEAD>Safety Problems Continue At Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant was plagued by safety problems two months after federal agents raided it for evidence of alleged environmental crimes, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. The safety inspection report for the week of Aug. 7-11, obtained Wednesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said there was `` no improvement in the radiological protection areas'' at Rocky Flats during the past several months. A similar report, based on a plant inspection in July, detailed 10 serious problems with radiation protection at the plant. None of the specific problems cited in July resurfaced in August, however. Rocky Flats is operated by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under contract from the DOE. The plant produces plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is investigating officials from <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION> and the DOE for allegedly conspiring to illegally dispose of radioactive and hazardous wastes. About 75 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and special officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> raided the plant on June 6 after a search warrant was issued on an affidavit containing more than 100 pages of allegations. A <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the new safety inspections they started at Rocky Flats in early July are correcting many problems. But spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heints </PERSON> admitted no factory is perfect, not even one that handles plutonium. `` We act on these things as soon as we are notified of them,'' he said. `` But with as many people as we have here, some people are just going to get careless.'' The plant employs about 6,000 people. The report, written by an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> safety inspector, said an employee was seen in a radiation control area not wearing anti-contamination clothing. The employee then left the area without going through a required monitoring device. Another employee in a building where radioactive material is handled violated safety procedures by leaving doors open that should have been closed, the report said. `` These are just two of the numerous problems observed across the Rocky Flats site,'' the inspector wrote.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is in a costly war with drug traffickers, and it appears to have little chance of a quick victory. The current campaign to crush drug lords and their private armies, if it continues, is likely to drag on for years before it succeeds, according to officials familiar with the situation. It will take billions of dollars and at least a decade to defeat the traffickers, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said in response to a question during a briefing Wednesday. The official spoke on condition that his remarks be paraphrased, that he not be identified and that the briefing not be recorded. A former Colombian army intelligence officer told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter that he, too, thinks it will take billions of dollars and well over a decade before drug traffickers are no longer a threat. The officer, a former major, said he has his doubts about whether the war can be won at all. He also spoke on condition of anonymity. The former army officer pointed out that there is no reason to believe government security forces will have any more success fighting drug traffickers than they have had combating leftist guerrillas. The army has been fighting leftist guerrillas for three decades, and the rebel forces have grown steadily to an estimated 10,000 combatants. The traffickers' power also has grown quickly. Fifteen years ago, some of today's millionaire and billionaire cocaine traffickers were pickpockets and pig farmers. Six years ago they offered to pay off <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion foreign debt if the government would give them amnesty. The offer was rejected. Today, the traffickers have private armies totaling about 4,000 men, intelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of airplanes and helicopters, the former major said. To meet this growing threat, the government has sharply increased its spending on security forces, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has authorized $ 65 million of emergency assistance to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to fight the traffickers. Unfortunately, it all may be too little, too late. `` A lot of army officers know it would take billions of dollars to exterminate all of the drug traffickers, to destroy their empires,'' the former intelligence officer said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been giving <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> about $ 10 million a year to fight the traffickers, an amount that seems small considering the urgency the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given the drug problem and the traffickers' power. In the last five years, an AP reporter in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> has seen many signs of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s inability to combat the cocaine problem. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DEA agent once said that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s anti-drug agents were so poorly equipped that they had to beg gas from their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts to go on drug raids. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot flying search-and-destroy missions over the eastern jungles to eradicate coca plantations told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reporter that pilots need longer range planes to be effective. And farmers in the Andes in southeast <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> told the reporter they were n't worried about police helicopters swooping down periodically to destroy coca bushes. New bushes are planted immediately after police leave, they said. Army troops in the field are poorly equipped. Boots are worn until they almost fall apart. As AP reporter in combat areas has seen soldiers flagging down banana trucks and forcing drivers to transport troops because the army does not have enough trucks of its own. Meanwhile, the traffickers use the most modern automatic weapons, including light antitank weapons. The former intelligence officer told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that former colleagues told him recently about raids on one trafficker's hideout that turned up records indicating he spent $ 100,000 a month gathering information. Former President <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, speaking of the traffickers during his 1982-86 term, said: `` <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is fighting against something that is stronger than the state.'' <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>'s justice minister, <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, was murdered, riddled with bullets because raids on cocaine laboratories had hurt the traffickers too much. In the last 10 years, traffickers have killed 220 judges and other court employes, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorney general, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others perceived by traffickers as a threat to their business. To counter the violence, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government has started for the first time in 30 years spending more on the military than on education. The government increased the military's share of the 1990 budget to 17 percent from 10 percent, for a total of $ 560 million. That is almost certainly bound to limit growth of spending on schools, hospitals and other public works. It is that sort of thinking that got <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s guerrillas started three decades ago. Progressive governments have done much to develop the country, but extreme poverty is still a problem. Many children grow up never tasting meat or milk. Cardboard boxes discarded in front of houses disappear in minutes, taken by people who sell them. People digging in garbage dumps for bones to sell to chemical companies and for such things as bottles are so common that there are labor unions among the scavengers. Such shortcomings are eventually going to have to be weighed as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s guerrillas continue to press for changes in government spending to help the country's poor people. A costly and continued war against drug traffickers will make that difficult if not impossible unless there is massive aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team that will monitor elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in February will be led by <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general with a long record of government service. After the announcement was made Wednesday, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 69, declined to say whether he thought <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would hold a free and fair election. He said he would bring to the job a long experience in hard-fought campaigns. `` I've been a candidate; I've been involved in elections, I once even ran a recount in a gubernatorial election in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> many years ago,'' he said in a telephone interview. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government opposed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s appointment and resisted it for weeks. No one at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> would comment on the appointment. The elections come at a crucial point in <LOCATION> Nicargua </LOCATION>'s history. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recently withdrew its military support for the Contra rebels, and the fighting force is expected to disband. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> is best known for resigning as attorney general in protest during the `` Saturday night massacre'' episode in the Watergate scandal. He quit the night of Oct. 10, 1973, the same night President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> fired Watergate special prosecutor <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and a group of jurists and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials called the Commission on the Independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> just returned from that country, where elections leading to independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are set for November. On Tuesday, commission members criticized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s procedures for the vote <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> periodically to assess the situation for Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, and would oversee the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer mission.

 A lightskinned woman has won her battle to be designated black, even though her parents listed her as white on her birth certificate in an attempt to help her overcome racial bias. A judge on Wednesday directed <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials to issue a new birth certificate for 39-year-old <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` I'm glad it's over,'' said the former <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher, who always called herself black. `` I'm very thrilled.'' Her attorney, <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>' current birth certificates do not designate race, so her new one will have no race on it at all. `` But that is fine with us,'' he said. The order came from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who heard <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s plea to stop the illusion that she was white, a well-intentioned deception she said her parents started. Her father, who's black, and her mother, who had a white mother and a black father, endowed their daughter with a fair complexion, green eyes and a light brown hair that would allow perpetuation of the secret. `` My parents wanted their kids to make it, and they picked the easiest way possible,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` They knew what it was to be black. They knew the problems.'' At that time, passing for white was risky but financially rewarding for blacks who had the physical and emotional ability, she said. `` Mom really stressed the white world on the kids _ education, manners _ and she was very paranoid about the secret getting out,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. But she said she could n't blame her parents. `` I resent that this society is set up in such a way that someone would have to pass -LRB- for another race -RRB-. It's a disgrace that this country is so screwed up racially. Because it really is,'' she said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said that, living as a black, she never was bothered by the heritage of deception except when applying for work. Prospective employers would point out the discrepancy between the `` white'' on her birth certificate and the `` black'' she had filled in as race on an application, accusing her of lying to take advantage of policies that encourage minority hiring. Her claim of civil rights discrimination following the incident was rejected, too, because of the birth certificate. `` The federal government put in writing that I was not black'' and that was too much, she said. `` It just hurt that this was the federal government -LRB- saying -RRB- the history of my family did n't mean anything.'' So she decided to pursue the change. `` This is like emancipation for me. So I wo n't have to go through this again,'' she said. `` I do n't want to be put in a box I do n't fit in.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> asked the Austrian railroad today to begin preparing for the mass transfer of thousands of East German refugees in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who are awaiting resettlement in the West, rail officials said. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the request to make an unspecified number of railway cars available for Sept. 6 came from officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the West German capital. Another railway official said Sept. 6 was only one of several possible dates for such a mass movement of East Germans, and `` I personally expect this to happen before that.'' Thousands of East Germans have fled into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since May, when that Communist country, which is experimenting with Western-style reforms, dismantled much of its border fortifications with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The border flood has created friction between the relatively liberal government in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and hard-line leaders in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbor <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many refugees say they are fleeing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s stagnant economy. An Austrian government source on Wednesday said at least 1,500 East Germans would be allowed to leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> under a plan being drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. But the second rail official, who also asked to remain anonymous, said German <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> officials told the Austrians to prepare for between 15,000-20 ,000 East German refugees, adding, `` This number is fairly official. The rail official said Austrian Railways had promised the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to have 50 rail cars available within six hours at an unspecified border point with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Neither Austrian railway officials nor their Hungarian counterparts had been asked to move East German refugees directly from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, he said. Asked how they would cross the border, the official speculated that they would either cross on foot or ride vans or buses. More than 5,000 East Germans frustrated by rigid constraints at home on economic and political freedom have fled to the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since July, according to West German estimates. Thousands more in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who have outstayed visitors' visas refuse to go back and are crowding <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> camps in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where a fifth camp for the refugees is to open Friday. Hundreds of like-minded East Germans also refuse to leave West German diplomatic property in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> unless guaranteed safe passage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which considers them citizens. Most of the East Germans managing to flee have done so from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in May began removing barbed wire and other barriers. Some others have had to risk two illegal escapes, one from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> _ the only country East Germans can visit without permission from their Communist government _ to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and then from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Detailing the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plan Wednesday, the Austrian government source said it involves transporting the refugees from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Speculation of an impending major development in the protracted standoff was fueled Wednesday by the surprise visit of West German envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for talks with Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> last week allowed 108 East Germans holed up in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> embassy to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in a plan also organized by the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> said then it was a one-time occurrence. But the West German state of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> continued today to set up four tent camps for East German refugees, further heightening speculation of a mass exodus within the next few days. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a West German government spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, said he did not know how many East Germans now in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would eventually ask to come to the West, but officials estimate there are 150,000 to 200,000 vacationing there. Hungarian and West German officials speculate many of the undecided East Germans with school-age children will make up their minds this weekend whether to return home in time for the start of the school year. East German authorities have pledged that none of those returning would face penalties for attempted escape attempts or overstaying visitors' visas in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Teachers' Strikes Reaches Fourth Day With Little Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Teachers' strikes idled nearly 60,000 students in five states today as the walkouts marked the fourth day with little progress in reaching an agreement. The strikes canceled classes for more than 20,000 students in three <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> districts; 14,400 students in two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> districts; 11,150 in two <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> districts; 7,000 in three <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> districts, and 3,400 students in one district in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Pay and benefits were the major issues for the estimated 2,900 teachers on strike, most since Monday. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, however, teachers in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> reached a tentative settlement Wednesday night, but their colleagues were n't talking in three other districts. The pact <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> teachers agreed upon offered wage increases averaging 5 percent a year for four years. The 991 teachers reported for work today, and the 16,691 students are to return Tuesday. The strikes so far have spared any large school systems. But the leaders of unions representing 4,700 teachers in two <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, area districts have voted to strike over pay Sept. 5, the first day of school for 94,000 students.

<HEAD>Cracks Confirmed In Steel Lining of Three Mile Island Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A steel sheet lining the bottom of a Three Mile Island reactor cracked in spots during the 1979 accident, officials said after seeing video footage from the depths of the submerged reactor. But a clear picture of how well the Unit 2 reactor vessel withstood the 5,000-degree heat will have to await further study. The first color video to be taken inside the 40-foot depths of the submerged reactor clearly showed that lines first spotted in July were cracks, said the plant operator, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday. Investigation of the four cracks on Saturday required a newly developed radiation-resistant color television camera and specially designed tools to brush debris from the area, probe each crack and take measurements. The cracks, one as long as 6 inches and just fractions of an inch wide and deep, were caused by molten uranium fuel that streamed like lava to the reactor bottom during the accident. `` It's all new, but it is not surprising to find them at this location,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>. Though other cracks are possible in the thin steel sheet, the company feels it's more important to concentrate on removing thousands of pounds of fuel debris still left in the reactor. Fuel removal should be completed by November so a $ 7 million, 11-nation research project into the 5-inch thick, carbon steel reactor vessel can start, <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON> said. `` That's when we'll get a more definitive analysis of how the bottom head withstood the accident,'' <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON> said. Until then it will not be known if the cracks in the three-sixteenths-inch thick sheeting extend into the vessel, he added. The stainless steel layer is intended to protect the carbon steel walls of the vessel from corrosion. The accident, the worst ever at a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> commercial nuclear power plant, was triggered by a combination of operator and mechanical errors. Water was cut off to the 150-ton radioactive core and about half of it melted. Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere. <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION>'s Unit 1, adjacent to the damaged plant, was closed for six years after the March 1979 accident, but was returned to commercial service in 1985.

 A woman who said she was brutalized into helping her boyfriend in a rape-murder was sentenced to death by a judge who said he believed she `` was in this thing up to the hilt.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, 27, on Wednesday became the first woman to be sentenced to death in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since capital punishment was reinstated in 1977. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> sentenced both her and her former lover, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>, 33, to death for the Nov. 7, 1986, slaying of <PERSON> Corinna </PERSON> <PERSON> Novis </PERSON>, 20. They still face charges in the death of another young woman whose body was found five days later. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> wiped away tears when the sentence was pronounced. `` I'm sorry for what happened and I am ashamed that I let it happen,'' she told <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified she was brutalized and forced to commit the crimes, but the judge upheld the jury's recommendation, saying Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> `` was in this thing up to the hilt and enjoyed it up to the last minute.'' `` They were equal partners in this thing all the way down the line,'' <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy district attorney, said after Wednesday's sentencing. `` I did n't buy her domination story one bit.'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> raped her, beat her and cut off all her hair. She said he once told her, `` I am the devil, and I own you.'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, who has a 9-year-old son, will be imprisoned at the Correctional Institution for Women at <LOCATION> Frontera </LOCATION>. If appeals that are expected to take several years fail, she will be executed in the gas chamber. One woman has been executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since capital punishment was reinstated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Barfield </PERSON>, 52, was put to death in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.

Ms. <PERSON> Novis </PERSON> was raped, tortured and killed after she offered to give Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> a ride near a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said she thought she and her boyfriend were only going to kidnap and rob the woman.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today denied <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s charges that authorities carried out secret executions and mass arrests following the military crackdown in June. Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON>, at a weekly briefing, also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions had `` infringed upon <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dignity'' and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be held responsible for deteriorating ties between the countries. Also today, the official press reported that the government is tightening control of the economy and cracking down on profiteering in scarce materials and income tax evasion. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said claims by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> that a `` wave of repression'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> followed the June 3-4 military attack on student-led protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` are entirely ungrounded and unreasonable.'' He said that during the attack `` an extremely small number of people used terrorist means and took violent actions in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government. ... That the Chinese government according to law arrested those criminals and sentenced them to imprisonment is entirely legitimate and justified.'' `` No country or organization has the right to interfere in an issue that is purely another country's internal affair,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Amnesty said Wednesday it had sent Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> a telex message urging the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government to `` stop using judicial killing as a political tool'' and to release all `` prisoners of conscience.'' A statement released by the human rights group's headquarters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said at least 1,000 people were killed in the military attack on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The government has said about 200 died in the crackdown. The statement added: `` There was strong evidence that the authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres in early June to carry out secret executions but also to publicize certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition.'' The report said the number of people arrested as a result of the protests may be much higher than the official figure of 4,000. Asked whether <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has any political prisoners, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> replied: `` The Chinese government always attaches importance to human rights and protection of civil rights according to law. There's no such thing as political persecution in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and therefore there is no such thing accordingly as political prisoners.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says students and other pro-democracy activists who have been arrested were guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes, but denies they are political prisoners. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said current tensions between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` have been caused by the deep involvement of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and by its taking the lead to impose sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which damaged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s interests and infringed upon <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dignity.'' He said any improvement in bilateral relations `` depends on the policies and actions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Following the military crackdown, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stopped arms sales and other military exchanges with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and suspended high-level contacts. It also has urged international lending organizations to put off providing new credit to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. Reports in the official media today said the government is reasserting controls over the distribution and pricing of raw materials. The state also will launch a campaign against what it says is rampant tax evasion among the nation's 14.5 million privately owned enterprises, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingan </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, said the state will tighten controls on prices of some raw materials such as coal, rolled steel and non-ferrous metals. He said redundant middlemen will be eliminated, illegal dealers and officials trading power for money will be disciplined, and state supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained. Decentralization of controls over raw materials, one aspect of the economic reforms, has led to a chaotic situation of hoarding, speculation and price-gouging. Middlemen, often with links to influential party and government officials, buy up scarce materials at low government-set prices and sell them for huge profits on free markets to desperate factories. <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said at a conference Wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among private businessmen is not solved, `` It will certainly sap the morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on the enthusiasm of intellectuals.''

<HEAD>Orders at Eight-Month Low in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 1.7 percent in July to the lowest level in eight months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for both durable and nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 231.3 billion. It was the lowest level since November and the second decline in three months. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June and fell 2.6 percent in May. The latest decline was steeper than most analysts expected. Recently, a string of strong statistical reports have indicated that economists' fear of an imminent recession was overblown. However, today's report shows that the economy is still far from robust. If weakness in manufacturing persisted, it could lead to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate. In two other signs of sluggishness, shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.9 percent, the sharpest fall since March 1986, and inventories shot up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in five years. A runup in inventories without a corresponding rise in new orders can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to get rid of goods and shelves and backlots. In July, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, fell 2.2 percent, a revision from last week's estimate of a 1.9 percent decline Orders for nondurable goods fell 1.1 percent. In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 5.7 percent in July after gaining 5.0 percent a month earlier. This was one of the few bright spots in an otherwise negative report. Much of the July weakness was concentrated in orders for military goods, down 14.5 percent and non-electrical machinery, down 10.5 percent. New orders for aircraft pushed the transportation sector up 2.6 percent, despite weakness in automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding.

<HEAD>Former Italian Premier Resigns as President of Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said today he has resigned as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, thus ending seven years in the top leadership of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant political party. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> told reporters that he informed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> that he was concerned the party `` gives the impression of being in a different frequency than mine.'' `` I have already resigned,'' he said at the end of a three-day meeting of the party leadership. He suggested his management position restricted his freedom to express his views and that he needed time to reflect about the future line of the party. The resignation further eroded the power of one of the most influential Italian politicians of the 1980s. It also underscored the discord that has recently grown among traditional and more liberal factions of the party that has dominated Italian government since World War II. Political observers have speculated that a <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> resignation could lead to a formal split in the Christian Democrat party. Such a division would radically change the political landscape in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been the main force keeping the Communists out of power. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, 61, resigned as premier in May after heading the government for 13 months. His fall from power began three months earlier when he was forced to step down as <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> secretary, the party's top post, because of charges by party members that he held too much power. He was named party president, a position with far less authority. Months of bickering followed between <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>. On May 19, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> resigned as head of a five-party coalition that also included the Socialists, Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans. Christian Democrat veteran <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> formed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 49th postwar government in late July, after two months of unsuccessful efforts to resurrect the <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> government. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s resignation appeared to give ground to <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>'s faction in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, which is considered conservative and Roman Catholic Church-oriented <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> headed what was considered the party's left wing. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> remains a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, or lower house of Parliament. It was n't immediately clear whether he would stay on as a member of the party national council.

 The white man accused of firing the shot that killed a black teen-ager, setting off a racial furor, surrendered to upstate police today, a day after the victim was laid to rest amid anger and anguish. Police said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, 18, the subject of a weeklong manhunt, turned himself in to police in <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION> at about 2:30 a.m. Police in the <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town, about 175 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said they expected to send <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> back to the city this afternoon. Officials had said <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> was a member of a white mob that attacked <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, and three other blacks in the predominantly white <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> on Aug. 23. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, they said, is believed to have drawn a gun and killed <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> is the seventh person arrested in the attack. Two of them, including the man alleged to be the ringleader of the mob, were indicted Wednesday. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was mourned Wednesday by civil rights leaders, politicians and the parents of a black man killed in the 1986 <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> racial attack. `` If as we lower him in the grave, we are raised in consciousness, then his living and dying will not be in vain,'' <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said to spirited applause inside and outside the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> church where the funeral was held. `` It seems like I'm burying my son again,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandiford </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> died after being chased by whites into the path of a car in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Miles from the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s predominantly white <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> section where <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was killed, more than 300 people packed a small Baptist church. A thousand gathered outside, listening to the proceedings over two speakers set up outside the building in a mainly black section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` The longer we waste time in frivolous divisions, this will happen again and again and again,'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told the crowd. `` We say, as the Jews say, ` Never again. Never again. Never again.''' Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Republican mayoral hopeful <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> were heckled outside the church. None of them spoke at the funeral. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three friends were answering an ad for a used car when up to 30 whites, carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one gun, confronted them and killed him Aug. 23, authorities said. Mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> _ who was well-received by the crowd _ said he could understand why tempers might be running high. `` I think one has to understand there has been a young life taken, senselessly, uselessly,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who is black, said after the funeral. `` It's not abnormal or extreme for people to have that depth of feeling.'' Inside the church, filmmaker <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose current movie `` Do the Right Thing'' is about racism in another <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood, sat near <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' parents during the two-hour service. The death of the 23-year-old <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was invoked by several speakers. By coincidence, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> was a cousin of one of the teen-agers who were with <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> the day he was killed. `` Let freedom ring from <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, pastor of the church and a cousin of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` Let freedom ring from <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>. We're not going to take what we used to take. We're going to walk where we want to walk.'' A few <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> residents also went to the funeral to show their sympathy about the killing. `` Racism is wrong, and killing somebody is very evil. That is the thing that we all feel,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Barozzi </PERSON>, a priest at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominic </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>. Earlier, the grand jury charged <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19, with second-degree murder. <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON> also was charged with manslaughter. Both had been charged with first-degree assault, riot, criminal possession of a deadly weapon, civil rights violations, aggravated harassment, menacing and unlawful imprisonment. District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said the two `` acted with depraved indifference to human life.'' `` You do n't need to pull a trigger, you do n't need to stab somebody. If you act in concert with people who do actually effectuate the murder, then you can be held responsible,'' <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said. The judge allowed <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> _ the gang's alleged leader _ to remain free on $ 100,000 bail and <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON> on $ 75,000 bail. Four others have been arrested in the case.

 Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, the only daughter of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is separating from her husband <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> after 15 years of marriage, but they do not plan to divorce, Buckingham Palace announced today. The queen, on holiday at <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, was described by royal sources to be `` obviously saddened'' but to understand the couple's decision, which was taken in principle earlier this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency. `` Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> have decided to separate on terms agreed between them,'' the announcement said. `` There are no plans for divorce proceedings.'' The terms of the separation were not disclosed but <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 39, will continue to live at the couple's home, <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gloucestershire </LOCATION>, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 40, will move to another house nearby, the palace said. The palace press office could not say whether this would be <ORGANIZATION> Aston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> estate. The couple's children, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>, 8, will live with their mother at <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> will have full access to them, the palace said. Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, brushed past reporters this morning without answering questions. It was only the second formal rupture of a marriage within the immediate royal family in this century, said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage. Ms. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> could not recall another instance since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> attempted to divorce his wife shortly before he ascended to the throne in 1820. Before that, she said, there was no royal divorce since <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> and his six marriages in the 16th century. The separation announced by the palace today was disclosed Wednesday night by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' father, Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. Rumors of trouble in the marriage date back to 1981. In recent years, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> have spent periods of up to six months apart. Speculation that their marriage was on the rocks arose most recently in April, after personal letters written to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> by a handsome 35-year-old aide to the queen, naval Cmdr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, were stolen and sent to the tabloid The Sun. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' name has been linked romantically with several women in British tabloid reports in recent years. Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, 59, the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from photographer Lord <PERSON> Snowdon </PERSON>. He has remarried. She has not. As in the case of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, who is seventh in line to the throne, the palace repeatedly denied that <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s marriage was in trouble. A common view that has taken hold this century is that the royal family, as a symbol of national unity, is supposed to set an example for the nation. Before <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s divorce, British news media often depicted the royals as the ideal family. But the divorce showed they could not meet that expectation and cost them some of the unquestioning respect they had enjoyed. Sniping at the royals _ their glamorous, privileged lives, wealth and taxpayer money they receive to help carry out their duties _ now is commonplace. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, a former member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Olympic equestrian team, and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an ex-Army captain and Olympic equestrian gold medalist, met through their love of horses. They married in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 14, 1973, in a televised ceremony viewed by an estimated worldwide audience of 500 million. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, who is head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equestrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, was attending an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> today, and bodyguards and aides kept reporters away from her. She is due to return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by mid-September after traveling to <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> remained Wednesday at <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. His father's statement said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a commoner who farms and trains horses, `` will go on managing the work on the estate and will continue to organize the horse trials and the stables.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> has traveled widely for business and equestrian interests. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as president of the Save the Children Fund, a charity that helps poor children worldwide. On April 6, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest-circulation paper with a daily sale of 4 million copies, reported it had been handed four stolen letters written to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> by a man it did not identify. It did not disclose the contents but said it passed them to police. On April 8, the palace identified <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> as the writer to try to halt intense news media speculation. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> told reporters at that time that his marriage was `` fine and happy.'' On Aug. 23, the queen personally awarded <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> the Royal Victorian Order as he left her service after three years as her equerry to take command of a frigate. The citation said the order was awarded for `` extraordinary, important or personal services to the sovereign or the royal family.''

 <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> signed a peace accord today that calls for an end to fighting over a disputed strip of desert that has been the focus of 16 years of bloodshed, diplomats said. The agreement was signed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> by Chadian Foreign Minister Acheikh <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Oumar </PERSON> and his Libyan counterpart, <PERSON> Djadallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Azouz </PERSON> <PERSON> Talhi </PERSON>. Also at the signing was Algerian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Boualem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessaieh </PERSON>, who helped mediate the agreement. Details of the accord were worked out Aug. 21-25 in meetings outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign ministry in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> confirmed. The agreement calls for the parties to try to resolve their dispute through a political settlement within a year. If that fails, they are to take the issue to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION> to rule on who holds sovereignty over the Aozou strip, a 45,000-square-mile band of mineral-rich desert between the two countries. According to the Chadian Embassy in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which issued a copy of the accord, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> agreed to: _ The withdrawal of all forces from the disputed region, leaving it under the administration of a group of African observers until the court renders its decision _ The release of all prisoners of war held by both sides _ The halting of all hostilities _ The signing of a treaty of friendship <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> holds about 2,000 Libyan prisoners, while most of the Chadians held by <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> have been released. The accord was signed one day before <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> celebrates the 20th anniversary of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s rule. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> claimed the disputed land in 1973 under an unratified 1941 treaty between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, then colonial ruler of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which then ruled <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. By 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 3,000 Libyan soldiers occupied northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. In August 1987, <LOCATION> Chadian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> launched a successful offensive to recapture northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, but failed to push them out of the disputed area controlled by <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. In September 1988, a cease-fire was proclaimed under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity. A month later, the two countries re-established diplomatic relations and in July the two leaders held a brief summit in <LOCATION> Bamako </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, to settle the remaining differences. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has maintained a small force of 1,500 men in southern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> since September 1984 under Operation Sparrowhawk, although the troops have not been directly involved in the fighting. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> paid `` homage to the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries'' and expressed `` hope that this accord will allow the consolidation of peace in the region.'' <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, former allies, met for the first time in seven years July 21 in <LOCATION> Bamako </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. The two leaders shook hands, and the organizers of the meeting felt an accord was so close that they told reporters in the Malian capital that signature on a pact was simply a formality. The meeting ended with no agreement, not even a communique, but both sides later said progress had been made.

<TEXT>
 Moldavian leaders today declared their native tongue the official language of the republic but agreed to allow the use of Russian in some circumstances, a compromise aimed at appeasing Russian-speaking minorities. The Moldavian Supreme Soviet, meeting in the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, approved the language law overhwhelmingly, a <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> activist and a reporter for the republic's official news agency said by telephone. The initial proposal to make Moldavian the official language caused widespread strikes and protests by ethnic Russians and other Russian-speaking ethnic groups in the southern republic bordering <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The choice of language is an important issue for many of the diverse Soviet ethnic groups. Many have felt they were forced to adopt Russian even though their native tongues are vastly different and represent a distinct cultural heritage. <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON>, a member of a pro-Moldavian nationalist group known as the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, called the move `` a first victory'' for ethnic Moldavians. The bill was approved 321-11, said a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> ATEM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s official news agency. As the official language, Moldavian is to be used for government documents and meetings and commerce. The same legislation also contained a provision to placate <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> speakers: a declaration that Russian is the language `` of interethnic relations of the peoples of the U.S.S.R,'' apparently sanctioning the use of Russian in communications among different ethnic groups. The original draft of the legislation still pending said Moldavian must be used for everyday life within the republic, angering the Russian speakers. A compromise proposed Wednesday by <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <ORGANIZATION> Semen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grossu </ORGANIZATION> _ at the urging of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ said Moldavian would be the language of officials and documents, but Russian would be the everyday tongue for contact among all ethnic groups within the republic. Also today, the Moldavian Supreme Soviet approved legislation restoring the Latin alphabet to the Moldavian language. The Cyrillic alphabet, like that used in Russian, was imposed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> after he annexed <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed Cyrillic to back his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities. Many ethnic minorities in the republic do not speak Russian and have staged rallies and strikes to express their objections to the proposed language changes. <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> said the strikes, which have involved as many as 200 businesses and industries, were continuing today. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> has had no language law. Russian traditionally has been the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce, which upsets native Moldavians. Several hundred <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> speakers took to the streets of <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> today and held red flags to underscore their concerns as the Supreme Soviet met, <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Telephone Workers Returning to Bells in Five Midwest States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 35,000 telephone workers in five Midwestern states were returning to work in the wake of a tentative contract settlement with the fifth and final <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> telephone-service subsidiary. The agreement reached early Wednesday with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> ended the walkout that began Aug. 13. Several hours later, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> workers began returning to jobs there and at the Bell subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` We want to show <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> that we not only go on strike together, but we will come back together,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 4, in a statement released by his office in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. While the five <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies negotiated separately with union locals, the workers held off returning to work until all five reached settlements. The union is `` encouraged by the fact that we were able to achieve settlements that we can recommend to the membership,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I think both the union and management will be glad to leave the jobs they've been doing right now,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidmar </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> Local 4340 in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Ratification votes are expected to take place within 30 days, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenefick </PERSON>, a union spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A spokesman for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> said operations would begin returning to normal almost immediately, although both sides said it might take a day or two for all employees to report back to work. The number of <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers and the jobs they handle range widely among the companies, from <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 12,800 employees _ including operators, phone installers, repair workers and service representatives _ to <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,900 union members, almost all of them operators. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a tentative contract with strikers Monday, after weekend agreements at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> announced a tentative agreement late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary that provides planning and coordination for the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries, also settled with about 580 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers over the weekend. All contracts are for three years, but details of the pacts were not available in all cases, pending meetings with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 150 locals, <PERSON> Kenefick </PERSON> said. Each calls for a base wage increase of 9 percent to 10 percent over three years, he said. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, striking telephone workers and the <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday for their first negotiations in two weeks. The company's 60,000 workers walked off the job three weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which like <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> is a `` Baby Bell'' created five years ago by the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, serves most of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` There was no major progress, but it's encouraging that the talks did n't break off,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Master </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, one of two striking unions. Since the 40,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and 20,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> took to the picket line on Aug. 6, the company and the union have met only twice. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> is the only `` Baby Bell'' that has not reached a settlement with its unions. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> workers in six states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, ended their strike Monday after agreements were reached with Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> locals in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. A tentative contract settlement also has been reached at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, which serves <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

 The explosives detection devices the government wants installed at 40 of the world's busiest airports might not have detected the bomb that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 last year, a congresswoman said today. Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House Government Operations transportation subcommittee, said more work on the detection equipment is needed She questioned whether it would have picked up the relatively small bomb _ believed to have weighed about one pound _ that brought down Flight 103 last December over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s detection standards were set several years ago and have not been revised as its knowledge about explosives and terrorists has become more precise,'' the congresswoman wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> recently in comments made available today. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulation issued Wednesday was made possible because of evolving technology that allows detection of chemicals in plastic explosives. The equipment likely to be installed detects nitrogen, a component in most explosives but also present in small amounts in wool, leather and nylon. This makes detection of small bombs difficult, Ms. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, because the device does not determine the source of the nitrogen. `` The smaller the amount of explosive, the more difficult it is to detect in the background nitrogen content of the suitcase,'' she wrote. The airlines, which would have to pay an estimated $ 393 million over the next 10 years to install detection devices, have questioned the cost and effectiveness of the technology available to meet the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requirement. `` We can not support the widespread deployment of this equipment in the near term because its capability has not yet been demonstrated,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an airline industry group. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, which can require airlines to follow certain procedures abroad as a condition for flying into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports, says it will continue to consider whether to require the new screening on all international flights by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers _ a move that could send the cost to airlines to an estimated $ 896 million by 1999. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has acquired six prototype screening devices, the first already installed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The others are scheduled for installation by the end of the year at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and airports in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> declined to identify the other 34 airports, citing security considerations and the possibility there could be some shifts in those affected. Investigators have concluded that the bomb that exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> was hidden in checked luggage loaded in the forward cargo compartment of the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. The rule does not require a particular device but says one called Thermal Neutron Analysis has been `` shown to have the highest degree of explosives detection currently possible for detecting known civilian and military explosives, manufactured here and abroad.'' Any system used by the airlines must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The rule requires that the system be automated, detect specified quantities and configurations of explosives as defined by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and be safe for operators and baggage. The <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> units are estimated to cost $ 750,000 each, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said this cost is expected to drop as production increases. The device was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> contract. The agency said it has been tested successfully at several airports. The system emits low-energy neutrons that pass through luggage and interact with the chemical elements in explosives, triggering an alarm. The detection is done by computer.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national drug strategy envisions sending up to $ 260 million in economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in an effort to stomp out cocaine where it's produced, an administration source says. The final version of the president's plan, which he will unveil in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night, will be much like the draft proposed by drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, according to another source. It will be tough on users, heavy on law enforcement and call for a new emphasis on treatment, the source said. But it wo n't threaten states with a loss of federal highway funds if they do n't impose strict anti-drug laws, as <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s draft had proposed, and it wo n't include the $ 25 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some parts of the 180-page drug stategy will not be made public, another official said today, adding: `` It's a war, and you do n't give all your plans to the enemy. The other administration source, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strategy will call for $ 250 million to $ 260 million in economic and military aid for the three main cocaine producing countries _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., unveiled `` debt-for-drugs'' legislation intended to offer debt-relief incentives to Latin American nations to subsidize the withdrawal of farm land from producing coca crops, which are refined to produce cocaine A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment of $ 400 million in such a plan could free enough funds to subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in coca production, said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who plans to introduce the legislation when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next month. Sources who had seen the classified section of the draft containing information about proposed aid to the three Latin American countries had said the figure could reach $ 300 million, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> indicated Tuesday that it would be even higher. Scowcroft had included the $ 65 million in military equipment that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced on Friday for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. That money comes from a discretionary fund available for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. The strategy covers fiscal 1990. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with his top lieutenants in the drug war Tuesday at his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to discuss the strategy, the focus of the meeting was <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, sources said Wednesday. `` The fundamental issues of the strategy ... did not change,'' a third source said, noting that the final strategy had gone to the printer before the meeting occurred. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been wracked with violence since President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> imposed emergency regulations allowing the immediate resumption of extraditions of alleged drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The move came after the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers. Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> met for about 40 minutes Wednesday with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who declined to say what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s final drug strategy provides for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> asked on Tuesday for $ 19 million in aid for judicial protection. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has so far pledged $ 2.5 million. The crackdown on drug users called for in the strategy will start early, with a program allowing judges to strip student loans and other federal benefits from drug offenders expected to begin Friday. The program, required by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, wo n't affect welfare, disability or Social Security benefits The decision to drop the plan for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objections after the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed combining it with a new money-laundering intelligence center, a source said. The draft also had called for a 49 percent increase in treatment funds, $ 925 million in 1990 compared with $ 621 million in the current budget, as well as $ 1.2 billion for new prisons, a 28 percent increase. The draft sought 10 percent reductions in drug use in two years and a 50 percent reduction in a decade. It called for the same reductions in supply, as represented by estimates of illicit drugs coming into the country and estimates derived from reports of the ease of obtaining drugs. It also focused on the street crime of the inner city spawned by the drug trade and the insidious nature of crack, the highly addictive, smokeable form of cocaine. The draft called for increasing justice assistance grants to states and cities from $ 150 million to $ 350 million. Copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the media shortly after it was produced in late July. The sections of the drug strategy that will remain classified deal with the limits the administration is willing to go to attack drug traffickers, growers and users. `` You do n't want the narco-traffickers to know what the limits are,'' an official said. `` We ca n't let them know how far we would go before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in.'' He said the sections dealing with intelligence gathering and detailed analysis on the drug situations overseas and domestically also would be classified. `` The idea is to tell as much as possible to the people,'' the source said. `` But it is obvious we ca n't tell all.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> today proposed a sweeping plan that would provide academic help to students from the third grade through high school and promise graduates money toward college costs. In return, parents and children signing up for the `` <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Children's Crusade'' would have to obey the law, avoid drugs, agree to work with mentors and tutors, have their report cards monitored by state officials and act as good examples in their neighborhoods. Mentors would work with students much like the national <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> program, giving advice and acting as companions and role models. The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> approved the program shortly after the DiPrete announced it this morning. `` <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is about to become the first state to embark on a program of this magnitude on a statewide basis,'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said would be `` knocking on the door of the White House for a significant contribution'' of federal funds for the plan. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state last year enacted `` Liberty Scholarships'' for lower-income students accepted at public or private <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> colleges. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s program goes further to enroll students at an early age and give them educational and social help, said <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s senior assistant. The crusade is aimed at the estimated one-third of the state's 10,000 third-graders who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or whose families receive food stamps, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said It would seek to cut the dropout rate among those students in half, to 25 percent. As a result, an estimated 1,200 additional students each year would attend college and 1,200 would go on to other training programs. Students from other families could seek mentors and tutoring help, but would not be promised the scholarships, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. There would be little checking on a family's financial status, she said. `` We do n't want the borderline people to slip through the cracks,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. `` If three people cheat, that's fine. They probably need our help anyhow.'' The Children's Crusade would enroll its first class of third-graders in September 1991. The maximum scholarship available when the youngsters reach collage age a decade later be $ 3,436 per year, the estimated tuition cost at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> in the year 2000. The maximum scholarship would increase 5 percent a year after that, said <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrocelli </PERSON>, the state's higher education commissioner. Students attending other state schools and apprenticeship programs or proprietary schools would receive less. Students attending private colleges, whose tuitions are higher, would receive the maximum scholarship. `` We really feel that if the program is successful, we may have made a fundamental change in certain patterns'' that contribute to students dropping out, said <PERSON> Petrocelli </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> plans to ask businesses, foundations and schools to contribute $ 10 million to a state-created foundation to get the program going. The state would be expected to contribute $ 3.2 million a year, bringing the fund, with interest, to approximately $ 50 million after 10 years, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. The money would pay for scholarships, tutors and administrative costs. `` If it does n't work, we'll give everyone their money back,'' she said. <PERSON> Petrocelli </PERSON> said mentors would be recruited among high school and college students, the elderly and others. Report cards would be monitored by the state's higher education office.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has abandoned plans to travel to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> next month in the face of continuing negative publicity over the Exxon Valdez oil spill, it was learned today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip would have been part of a mid-September swing to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The White House had not officially announced the trip, as details continued to be worked out. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> leg of the trip would have been for the purpose of examining the cleanup progress in the wake of the multimillion-gallon oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez last March. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was said to be very intent on going, but one source, speaking on condition of anonymity said the views of other officials that it would be unwise politically prevailed. It was thought it would not be a good idea for the president to renew focus on the oil spill, a situation for which he was criticized for not moving quickly enough to involve the federal government in the cleanup. Initially the administration took the position that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was handling the job adequately. But after several days, officials criticized the company, saying it had not moved as quickly as it could have. The 11-million gallon spill occurred March 24 in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, smearing oil on hundreds of miles of once pristine shoreline. Environmentalists have criticized <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to halt the cleanup next month in the face of severe weather conditions.

 An empty fuel tank fell off an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet during a routine training run, crashing into a soybean field but causing no injuries or damage, authorities said. The 500-pound tank, about 15 feet long and 2 feet in diameter, dropped from an F-4 Phantom jet Wednesday afternoon about a half-mile north of this popular beach resort, state police said. Capt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, put the site where the 600-gallon tank fell at about 2 miles from the town. Officials could not immediately explain the discrepancy. `` We heard a whistling sound, and then there was a sound like an explosion when it hit the ground,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON>, a resident of a nearby housing development who was in his back yard when the tank fell. The jet was one of three fighters that had taken off from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> statement.

 A school superintendent said today he does not plan to to rehire the county's Teacher of the Year even though a jury acquitted her of charges she manufactured and possessed marijuana. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, who was accused of helping her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, grow marijuana in their backyard greenhouse, was found innocent of the charges in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday. She said afterward she might try to get her job back because `` I am a teacher.'' But Superintendent <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said today he does not intend to rehire <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> to her former post at <ORGANIZATION> Colquitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` The action of the school board will stand until we're told otherwise,'' he said, noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> already has appealed her firing to the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Mock said Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> was fired on a charge of immorality _ that she knowingly allowed marijuana to be used. The local school board did not consider whether she was involved in possessing or growing marijuana, he said. `` She admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that it was being used,'' he said. `` The action taken yesterday -LRB- by the jury -RRB- and the action taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> are not related to each other.'' Jurors deliberated two hours Wednesday before reaching their verdict. `` I respect the opinion of the jury _ and that's why we have juries _ but I'll continue to prosecute cases where drug squads find marijuana growing in someone's back yard,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The couple were arrested May 19 when drug agents, acting on a tip, found 22 small marijuana plants growing in their back yard and drug paraphernalia in their house. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> testified that her husband planted marijuana without her knowledge. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said the same thing in earlier testimony, and 11 character witnesses took the stand to vouch for her honesty. `` It was the truth, and they knew it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said as jubilant relatives and supporters rushed up to congratulate her Wednesday evening. During the trial, the 38-year-old teacher testified: `` I'm trying desperately to put my life back together. I'm trying to clear my name. `` My picture was on the front page of the newspaper _ Teacher of the Year charged with marijuana. I spent two weeks curled up in a fetal position.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> questioned her about marijuana found in a chest of drawers in the couple's bedroom and about a pipe with drug residue in a washroom chest. `` I trust my husband, and in one thing he betrayed me,'' she said. `` He never told me he would quit. That would have been a lie. He said: ` <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> I'll cut down. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, I wo n't smoke it in your presence.''' In closing arguments, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said both Sherlings were too intelligent for one to have grown marijuana in the back yard without the other's knowledge. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>'s attorney, said she had suffered enough by putting up with her husband's marijuana addiction. `` <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> is innocent except for one thing,'' May said. `` She's guilty of loving her husband, and she may be guilty of living with him all these years and suffering through what she's suffered. The couple's arrest came as a shock to most in <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, an agricultural community of 15,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> could have been sentenced to up to 11 years in prison and fined $ 1,000 if convicted on a felony count of manufacturing marijuana and a misdemeanor charge of possessing less than an ounce of the drug. She told the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that she first learned of the marijuana in the back yard when she phoned her home and a drug agent answered. `` I went home and saw police cars all over the place,'' she said. `` I saw my husband in the living room with his hands handcuffed behind his back. My whole world came crashing in on me.'' Character witnesses, including co-workers, members of a theater group and parents from a local Boy Scout troop, praised Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> as a woman of stellar character who would never lie to her friends about something as serious as marijuana use. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, a former teacher and attorney, has admitted chronic marijuana use. He testified Tuesday that his wife never grew or smoked the stuff.

<TEXT>
 A teacher who tells fortunes and gives card readings but says she was falsely accused of practicing witchcraft has filed a $ 1.6 million suit against a school district, contending it ruined her career. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Linzay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in federal court Tuesday, six months after she quit her job teaching speech and drama at <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. She contends that school district administrators accused her of practicing witchcraft and coerced her into resigning. She has been unable to find a teaching job since, the suit says. Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> resigned from the tenured teaching position she had held for seven years in February after complaints from a parent that she practiced witchcraft. In her lawsuit, Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> said she never practiced or believed in witchcraft. But in a newspaper interview in February, Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> said she had been hearing voices `` like <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc'' since childhood. She said she tells fortunes, gives card readings and has warned people to get medical treatment for otherwise undetected illnesses. She said her belief in psychic phenomenon does not extend to witchcraft. Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> said in February that she resigned rather then fend off speculation about her beliefs. Her attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, said his client was never disciplined while working in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The parent's complaint stemmed from a publication, Intuitive Directory, that listed Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> as one of several people in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area who practice witchcraft. Ms. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> said at the time that the publication erroneously included witchcraft along with her talents in hypnosis, meditation, channeling and card reading.

 A man has dropped a lawsuit seeking to keep his ex-girlfriend from getting an abortion after learning that she was not pregnant, his lawyer said. <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Wednesday dropped his suit against a woman publicly known as `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' after learning through a variety of sources, though not from a medical examination, that she was not pregnant, said his attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>. The 23-year-old woman has refused to take a pregnancy test and still will not say if she was pregnant, said the woman's attorney, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON>. `` That is none of their business,'' she said, referring to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and his attorney. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> knew no more about her client's condition Wednesday than when he undertook his court fight last week. `` We take the position that that is a victory,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said. Once the suit was withdrawn, a temporary restraining order preventing the woman from seeking an abortion became invalid. `` She was extremely relieved,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said. `` She plans to resume her life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said a three-month relationship between her client and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ended about a month ago but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 34, wanted the woman to carry the fetus to term, if indeed she was pregnant. Ms. <PERSON> Eslinger </PERSON> said she sees the suit's withdrawal as both vindication of her belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did not have jurisdiction, and affirmation of a woman's right to independently terminate a pregnancy within the first three months. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, executive director of the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the lawsuit appeared to be part of an effort by anti-abortion activists to alter current law. `` This is guerrilla warfare by the right-to-lifers,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` There is no legal basis for bringing these actions.'' But <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said he felt <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s motives were sincere and in the interests of the unborn child. `` This case was not brought for publicity reasons,'' <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Acknowledge Honecker Recovering Slowly, Deny He Has Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Communist officials said Thursday that <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was recovering `` very slowly'' from a gall-bladder operation but denied reports the 77-year-old East German leader has cancer. On Wednesday, Western media reported that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s gall bladder operation two weeks ago had to be abandoned because of the `` condition of the tissue.'' West German security sources confirmed they had information <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s operation had to be abandoned because of complications. The mass-circulation West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was `` struggling with death. He is apparently incurably sick with cancer. East German officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday such assertions on cancer were `` totally unfounded.'' They conceded, however, that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s recovery was `` proceeding very slowly.'' Bild, which did not identify its sources, also said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is in an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> hospital, receives heavy doses of pain-killing medication and is `` hardly aware of his surroundings.'' Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> would not be attending the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> trade fair and all his appointments up to the middle of September had been canceled. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leadership attaches enormous prestige to the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> trade fair, which begins Sunday, and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> traditionally opens the biannual international event. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> underwent a gall bladder operation two weeks ago and has not been seen in public since. The operation was the second time this summer <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was hospitalized. Illness forced him to leave the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> on July 8 before its conclusion, and the official East German media later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to gallstones. He was released the following week, but looked frail and tired at a public appearance. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has ruled the country of 16.6 million people since 1971. He supervised the building of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall 10 years earlier. He has shunned the adoption of Kremlin-style reforms, a factor in the recent surge of refugees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> went to sea again today as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders mixed statecraft and recreation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and his family on a boat ride on a brilliant but windy morning, touring the rocky coastline up to nearby <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Porpoise </LOCATION>. The breezes that were stirring up whitecaps in the ocean could make it even harder for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to break his two-week streak of failing to catch a fish despite daily attempts. The president and the prime minister, old friends holding their third tete-a-tete this year, planned an informal mid-afternoon session with reporters before <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and family take their leave this evening. In Canadian parlance, the session was billed as a `` scrum'' _ something short of a full news conference at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s scenic family compound overlooking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, wife <PERSON> Mila </PERSON> and their four children arrived by helicopter at <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point Wednesday afternoon. `` We're going fishing,'' pronouncd a merry <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who added when asked what he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would talk about, `` Probably fish ... and lobster.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> later took the Mulroneys down the scenic <LOCATION> Kennebunk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the president's speedboat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, but they did n't appear to get in any fishing. Actually, lobster was one of the few possible bones of contention for the two leaders to mull over. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobstermen are griping that their Canadian counterparts are depressing prices by catching and exporting lobsters smaller than can be caught legally in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asking him to press <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on the issue. While White House aides said in advance that the two were likely to talk about the drug crisis in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and events in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> luncheon Wednesday, `` This is a pure, total vacation.'' `` I'm not going to look busy in order to convince people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it's something other than a vacation,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who actually has already let far more work intrude on this vacation than his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, allowed during his wood-chopping retreats to his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ranch. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approved a $ 65 million aid package for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> last Friday, huddled with top advisers over drug strategy Tuesday, and flies back briefly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday to meet <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, before a final Labor Day weekend here. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has had no success fishing despite daily outings since Aug. 16, told reporters while jogging that he was taking Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with him for luck on his next fishing trip. He said he would end the dry spell even if he has to `` murder'' some fish. In an oceanside speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Kennebunk-Kennebunkport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed chagrin at a `` vicious assault on my ability'': a graphic in the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> showing a bluefish inside a circle with a line slashing through it indicating no fish. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained a friend had caught a fish that very day while he was driving the boat. `` I think they should knock off that advertisement ... telling me that yet a 13th day I have n't caught one,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was named the resort's outstanding citizen of the year.

 An explosion today destroyed part of a three-story apartment building in downtown <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, killing one person and injuring at least three. Police said firefighters had to cross a floor supported only by water pipes to rescue one woman from a basement apartment. One of the first people to arrive at the scene said he found a dazed and bleeding woman walking near the building and a man lying in a pool of blood. Police confirmed the death of an unidentified man and said three people were hospitalized, including the woman pulled from the basement. Their conditions were not known. Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or propane. Earlier unconfirmed reports said as many as four people were killed when the building exploded shortly after 9:30 a.m. The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants. It is about a mile south of Parliament. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Legault </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> taxi driver, was returning to his apartment when he heard the explosion. He said that as he ran toward the building he encountered a dazed and bleeding woman. `` She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was still in the apartment,'' he said. <PERSON> Legault </PERSON> ran into the building where he said he saw a man lying in a doorway in a pool of blood. `` He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I checked and I think he was dead,'' said <PERSON> Legault </PERSON>. It was not immediately known if anyone was still trapped in the building.

 A woman testified today that her husband tried to take his foot off the accelerator as the family car crashed through a barrier and into the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where the couple's four children drowned The preliminary hearing for <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 28, is to determine whether he will stand trial in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempting to murder his wife in the Aug. 3 car wreck. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 32, testified that her husband complained of leg cramps as the family rode, but declined her offer to drive. She said the cramp worsened, and she watched her husband vainly try to pull his leg off the pedal and steer the car away from the river. The car rammed through a barrier, flipped over and landed on its top in the river bottom, drowning <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 8, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, 8 months. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> escaped from the car and were rescued when passing boaters tossed them life preservers. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> was charged in the deaths a week later, after police said he confessed to driving into the river to try to rid himself of family and financial burdens.

<TEXT>
 The Yugoslav national bank is planning to introduce a 1 million dinar banknote this fall, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Thursday. The new note, worth $ 35 at the current rate, is intended to ease difficulties caused by the country's 800 percent annual inflation rate. One dollar was worth almost 30,000 dinars on Thursday. The new bill, which will probably appear on Nov. 1, will be the country's second-largest. A 2 million dinar bill was put into circulation earlier in August. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s soaring inflation rate has caused large bills to lose value rapidly, with ever bigger denominations being issued. Yugoslavs and foreign tourists are obliged to carry huge quantities of paper money even when doing simple everyday shopping, and banks and other financial institutions have reported growing confusion in counting, handling and storing the vast quantities of small, nearly worthless, bills. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced it was planning to eliminate several zeros from present denominations.

 Next Tuesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will announce a new national anti-drug plan that is expected to include tougher penalties for drug users. A survey of state and federal drug laws shows that the legal climate for drug abusers is already much tougher than it was a few years ago.

 Not long ago, what happened to <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> `` Polo'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> would have been unthinkable. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, a 30-year-old man from <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier this summer for dealing crack. He had no prior criminal record. `` I've represented people who took lives and received less of a sentence,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> complained after the sentencing in federal court. But <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> was in the wrong place at the wrong time, doing the wrong thing. Laws against drug abuse in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have changed dramatically in the past five years. And while the only certain result so far has been overcrowded prisons and overburdened courts, police and prosecutors say they now have far more potent weapons with which to fight drugs than they had a short time ago. `` The laws have gotten tougher,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the former police chief of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They are good and strong and effective for our purposes.'' A decade ago, drug laws were in remission. The recreational drug use that had become popular during the late 1960s had fostered a new sense of permissiveness. Marijuana was decriminalized in some states, and laws against it went unenforced in others. Strong laws against cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines remained in place, but the legal system was less eager than it once was to enforce them. Crack, the cheap, smokable form of cocaine, ended that. Crack began showing up in a few large cities about five years ago and spread quickly across the country. It led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and nearly every state legislature to overhaul drug laws and impose much tougher penalties. Statistics on convictions and sentencings for drug crimes are scarce, but those that exist suggest that more people are going to prison for drug crimes than ever before. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, for instance, the number of people serving time for drug crimes has risen more than 400 percent in the past seven years. Federal drug convictions have jumped 161 percent in the 1980s, and the percentage of federal inmates serving time for drug crimes has more than doubled. About half the inmates in federal prisons today were convicted of drug crimes, and by 1995 the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> expects seven out of every 10 to be a drug criminal. That's in addition to the high percentage of convicts who were under the influence of drugs when they committed non-drug crimes such as murder. One reason for the upswing is the anti-drug laws that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed in 1984, 1986 and 1988. They established mandatory jail terms and fixed sentences for drug offenders, taking much of the sentencing discretion out of judges' hands. Similar laws have been passed by most states, and some have gone much further. `` That's been the major outcry in the last decade _ ` Let's get tough on the manufacturers and sellers.' And now it's, ` Let's get tough on the users too,''' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohling </PERSON>, who follows drug issues for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. In the past few years, Frohling said, virtually every state has raised the penalties for drug crimes that occur in or around schools. More than half have established stronger penalties for crack than for plain cocaine. Some have extended the death penalty to include murders committed during drug transactions. In the most recent wave of legislation, about two-thirds of the states have enacted laws allowing law enforcement officials to seize the property of drug dealers. It's difficult to assess the effectiveness of these laws, and some people believe they have been been failures. `` The problem we have is not the strength of the laws, but the application of the laws,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, a professor of criminal justice at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, said the emphasis on drug crimes has diverted police from other problems while doing little to stop drug abuse `` In lots of big cities, burglary is effectively being decriminalized while we concentrate on crack dealers,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also say the cost of imprisoning drug criminals is getting out of hand. In the federal prison system, it costs $ 15,000 a year to house one inmate, plus $ 5,000 in treatment costs for those with drug problems. Some people are beginning to look for alternatives. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state recently enacted one of the most comprehensive drug laws in the nation. It includes tough new penalties and an additional $ 21 million for prison construction. But it also provides for education and treatment, and its supporters say that will be crucial to its success. `` We wanted to attack the problem in just about every responsible way,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebersole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said preventing drug abuse is the only reasonable solution, given the alternative of more police, more courts and more prisons. `` Who can afford that?'' he said. `` What country can afford that?''

 A noisy flap is brewing over a new `` quiet time'' rule to be imposed at the county treasurer's office. `` It's a technique to help them plan their day,'' explained Assessor-Treasurer <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` It's more like kindergarten,'' said a disgruntled employee. Beginning Tuesday for two hours each morning, all but a few employees will be barred from receiving telephone calls, conversation will be banned and movement around the office will be discouraged to give workers `` a quiet, uninterrupted time to work at their desks,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a memo. The idea has come under fire from employees and outsiders who deal frequently with the agency, including developers and public officials. `` Give me a break,'' said county Auditor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonntag </PERSON>. `` We're in public service We only exist because people come to the counters.'' The counter where people go to resolve assessment problems or pay taxes will be open during the quiet time, but the attending staffers generally wo n't be allowed to go to other employees for immediate help. `` I very seldom can get a question answered by the people at the counter,'' said developer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>. `` I usually have to go into the back room to get a question answered.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he doubted many people would be turned away during quiet time. `` I think 90 percent can be handled at the counter,'' he said.

 Soldiers in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> killed five members of a paramilitary squad reportedly run by drug traffickers, and police today said more than 500 people were arrested for violating a curfew in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. American dependents of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employees were advised by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to leave the country. Also in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a rocket hit a paint factory early today, setting it on fire and injuring an undetermined number of people, radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> reported. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was imposed in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and eight other cities as part of a nationwide crackdown on cocaine traffickers who have waged a campaign of assassinations, bombings and arson in recent weeks. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> is considered the headquarters of the cartels that supply 80 percent of the cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. National police said in a communique that 530 people were arrested for vioalting the first day of the curfew. All but two had been released by this morning, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, a paramilitary band believed affiliated with drug traffickers clashed with an army patrol in a remote area of the northern state of <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> quoted military sources as saying. Five of the attackers were killed, <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> quoted the army sources as saying. Leftist guerrillas seeking to topple the government have generally been inactive during the recent war with drug lords, but new political violence broke out on Wednesday. Six insurgents of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed and one soldier was wounded in a battle Wednesday in the state of <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> morning daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said. Two policemen also were killed in a guerrilla ambush in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> said, quoting police in <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, 12 bodies were found in a shallow grave in the state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. One of the victims reportedly was identified as a veterinarian kidnapped several months ago by leftist rebels. Leftist guerrillas also executed 10 of their own ranks, apparently for suspicion of being traitors, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting sources with the army's 2nd Division in the northern state of <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a police force of 4,000 was on full alert and 18 special anti-terrorist units were stationed throughout the city. `` Everything has started with no major inconveniencies. People rushed to their homes shortly before the curfew time began and now the city is quiet,'' a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone Wednesday night. He said a fragmentation grenade exploded in a country club but caused only minor damage. Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> said the government would extend the curfew, the first in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 19 years, `` wherever it is required to prevent terrorism.'' He said <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a city of 2 million, had `` become a center of perturbation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> gave no reason for ordering the dependents of its staff to leave, but it was clearly related to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> campaign against drug traffickers and plans to extradite some suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The extradition of one suspect, reputed <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel finance chief <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, was considered imminent. An embassy spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview: `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy dependents have been ordered to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the next few days. That's all I can tell you.'' Because of the recurring violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the embassy already had a policy of not allowing dependents under the age of 18 but had permitted older children, spouses, parents and other adult dependents. The embassy order would apply to up to 50 relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> staffers, a source said. The order also recommended that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last week urged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists to stay away from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> to avoid the possibility of getting caught up in the violence there. The city has suffered almost daily bombing attacks by drug traffickers, who are pressing the government to end its 13-day-old crackdown and negotiate a peace. The government began its offensive after a string of assassinations that culminated Aug. 18 with the slaying of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the leading presidential hopeful. Authorities since have arrested several mid-level drug dealers in raids in which they seized more than $ 200 million in property, including lavish estates, office buildings, airplanes and cars allegedly obtained with drug money. The drug barons responded by declaring war on the government. <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and surrounding communities have been rocked by at least 18 bombings and three arson attacks, according to police reports. Several other bombs were found and deactivated. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an administration source said Wednesday that when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presents his drug control strategy next week, he will call for up to $ 260 million in economic and military aid for the three principal cocaine-producing countries _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>.

 A bridge being built over a major roadway collapsed during rush hour this morning, raining debris on commuters and injuring 14 people, state police said. One woman was in critical condition after the collapse of the Route 198 overpass over the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION>, which came about 6:30 a.m. while workers were pouring concrete, police said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police Deputy Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusick </PERSON> said four of the injured were in a car that was crushed under the overpass. Another was in a second car that was hit by debris, while the other nine were construction workers. Rescue and construction workers drilled holes into the pile of rubble and carried away debris a piece at a time searching for other vehicles that may have been trapped. By midday, however, officials concluded no one else was in the rubble, and heavy equipment was brought in to clean it up. The critically injured woman was taken by helicopter to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said state police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireton </PERSON>. The others were taken to various hospitals, he said. State police spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the collapse caused tremendous traffic backups. The southbound parkway was closed at Route 32, and traffic was being detoured around the area. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> police, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police and rescue teams from <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Arundel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s Counties were dispatched to the scene, along with at least two Medevac helicopters and two rescue buses. Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said he expected the roadway to be opened within 24 hours. `` Everyone's question is why, but it's impossible to tell,'' <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said. `` There is no way in the world I could tell what happened here.'' Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were on the scene. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, deputy administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said an independent investigator would also be brought in. The workers had poured about 120 cubic yards, or 200 tons, of concrete and were about two-thirds of the way through when the bridge collapsed in the middle, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. They began pouring concrete at 2 a.m. and were being watched by federal inspectors. `` The foreman said he heard a clanging or a clunk just before the bridge collapsed, but there was really no warning,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. He said the supports for the molds into which the concrete was being poured had been inspected and approved in early July.

 <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, who has n't appeared on screen in nine years, says the film he just finished is the last he'll make _ and it's a bomb. `` It's horrible,'' the Oscar-winning actor said Wednesday of `` The Freshman.'' `` It's going to be a flop, but after this, I'm retiring I'm so fed up. `` This picture, except for the Canadian crew, was an extremely unpleasant experience. I wish I had n't finished with a stinker.'' His gray hair combed straight back, an overweight <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> wore a big neck brace to ease muscles strained while skating for the first time in 20 years _ required of his role in the movie, in which he stars with <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, 65, who shot the Tri-Star Pictures production in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for the last 12 weeks, also told the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail that he's fed up with kowtowing to the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> publicity system and adores <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` I've come from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which is a warthog straight from hell. To sing my swan song here is very pleasant,'' he said in the mumble that turned Broadway on its ear when he made his name on stage in the late 1940s. <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, who won his first Oscar in 1954 for `` On The Waterfront,'' spoke in an interview conducted, surprisingly, at his request. <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>'s most recent film, the thriller `` The Formula,'' bombed in 1980. In the following years, he lived like a recluse on a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island. For years the actor has spoken with contempt of acting and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. In 1973, he refused to accept his second Oscar _ for `` The Godfather'' _ in protest against the movie industry's treatment of the American Indian. The same year he gave one of his best performances _ as the disillusioned hero in `` Last Tango in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' _ and he was again in demand. He was paid several million dollars for a 10-minute appearance in `` Superman'' in 1978. <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> said he never really liked acting. `` But there was nothing that would pay you that kind of money for that kind of foolishness,'' he said. `` This is my last day,'' he said at the conclusion of the interview. `` Two more shots and I'm done with this madness. ... You ca n't imagine how happy I am.''

 Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> said Thursday the government will take even tougher retrenchment measures in the next three years to reduce inflation and restore market order. Finance Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingqian </PERSON>, meanwhile, predicted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s money shortage wil grow more acute next year when more foreign loans start coming due The two officials delivered their sober assessments of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic situation to the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the legislature, which began meeting Tuesday <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> said consumer demand continued to grow and many measures intended to cut investment `` did n't work as expected,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Workers' income is still growing faster than their productivity, he said, and agricultural growth still lags far behind that of industry. `` The government will take tougher measures in the comming three years to accomplish the ongoing economic retrenchment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> reported. It gave no specifics of what measures would be taken. However, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier Thursday the government would crack down on illegal trading in key raw materials such as coal and steel, eliminate middlemen in the distribution chain, discipline illegal raw material dealers, and begin an investigation of private businesses to ensure they pay taxes. It quoted <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> as saying efforts would be made to control steel and coal prices and the trend of privatizing distribution of more and more materials would be halted. The government said Monday that any local officials who fail to cut investment will be punished. The government has been trying since September 1988 to reassert many controls over the economy that were weakened or abolished over a decade of reform. Inflation that peaked at about 36 percent _ it now is running at a 25 percent annual rate _ combined with shortages of key materials, hoarding, black marketeering and panic runs on banks triggered the pullback. Measures already taken include orders to cut capital construction, new restrictions on borrowing and government - control of the prices and distribution of some goods <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> told the legislature that the policies had succeeded in cutting industrial growth. Production in the first seven months of the year was up just 10.6 percent from the same period last year, which had been up 17 percent from the year before that. He said bank savings were up. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said state revenue exceeded expenditures over the seven months, although revenue grew more slowly than spending. But both officials spoke gloomily of the future. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> headlined <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s report: `` Financial situation dire,'' and quoted <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> faces `` great economic difficulty.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> noted that government subsidies have ballooned in recent years as it has bailed out inefficient state-owned companies, and tried to give farmers a better price for their grain while keeping groceries cheap for urban residents. Borrowing also has accelerated. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, zero in 1978, totaled $ 40 billion at the end of 1988, including $ 10 billion in short-term loans. The government also has borrowed $ 9.3 billion from its own citizens over the past decade by issuing treasury bonds. Many Chinese workers are required to buy the bonds, with the price automatically deducted from their pay. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> blamed the problems on ousted party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>'s `` errors in financial decisions,'' including violating what he called the `` socialist financial principle'' of balancing the budget. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who lost his post in a power struggle in June over handling of the spring democracy protests, had advocated rapid growth. Chinese officials have issued repeated assurances recently that the country will be able to repay its debt.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s only rabbi said Thursday he wo n't join leaders of other religions in a prayer for peace marking the 50th anniversary of World War II's start because of a Roman Catholic convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> Organizers had pointed to the participation of the rabbi _ a survivor of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp _ as evidence that Jews were not boycotting the event, led by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> and bringing to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> representatives of many other faiths. `` I personally will not participate in the joint prayers. When I go to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> I can not pray there because I am disturbed by a cross and the Carmelite convent there,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Joskowicz </PERSON>. `` One can not be barred from prayer at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and at the same time participate in joint prayers in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>,'' said the rabbi, who arrived in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in June. The World Prayer for Peace was designed to foster understanding among religions. Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is to give an address via a giant TV screen in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Royal Castle Square on Friday, the anniversary of the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that started the war. `` This is a moment for peace and reconciliation, a meeting of international friendship ... a day of peace, brotherhood of all the world's relgions,'' said <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsignior </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossano </PERSON>, rector of the <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lateram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. But Jewish-Catholic relations have been strained by the decision by the archbishop of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> to abandon a 1987 accord to move the Carmelite convent from the perimeter of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, and by a speech by Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glempany </PERSON>. International Jewish leaders were invited to the event but said they could not come, said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Marazziti </PERSON>, a prayer day organizer. <PERSON> Marazziti </PERSON> said the convent controversy `` may be one of the reasons but not the only reason'' for the lack of greater Jewish participation. There are no Jews on the list of religious representatives for the event. <PERSON> Marazziti </PERSON> said three representatives of the Jewish community were attending the conference but they were academic rather than religious leaders. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Neusner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unversity </ORGANIZATION> called the convent dispute a `` heartbreaking conflict'' between Catholics and Jews that shows the need for religions to learn to accommodate each other. <PERSON> Marazziti </PERSON> said he received confirmation Aug. 20 that <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON> would attend the prayer and had only heard informally that he would not. The Rev. <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieweglowski </PERSON>, a prayer organizer for the Polish Catholic episcopate, said he did not know about the rabbi's refusal to take part. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Riccardi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> Egidio that organized the prayer day denied Jews were boycotting and pointed to the rabbi's participation. <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON> said he would instead lead services Saturday at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s only synagogue in memory of the 5,000 Jews who died fighting with the Polish army during the war. Events also are scheduled at the monument to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto uprising and at the Jewish cemetery, large sections of which have become overgrown. Organizers of the peace prayer scheduled a trip to the international monument at <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION>, the main extermination camp for Jews in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> complex. Jewish groups and others view the convent as an intrusion of Christian religious symbols at the World War II death camp complex built in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> mainly to exterminate Jews. Among the 4 million killed there, at least 2.5 million were Jews, and <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON> called the site `` our biggest Jewish cemetery.'' Protests increased after the passing of a Feb. 22 deadline for moving the nuns to an interfaith prayer center farther away. In one incident, an American rabbi and six students were roughed up while being removed from the grounds. On Saturday, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> delivered a speech intended to quiet international criticism after the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> archbishop's Aug. 10 announcement on the convent. Instead, the controversy seemed fueled by <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s statement that anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews abandoned `` anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments. `` I can not believe that Cardinal <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> thought what he was reported to have said,'' said <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON>, recalling a recent cordial meeting with him. `` I can not speak for him but if I were him I would make some declaration which would correct it. This would ... extinguish in time the glimmer of anti-Semitism. `` I do n't want <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to become the country from which the flame of anti-Semitism would start. ... It is easy to extinguish it now when it is only a little glimmer but such a glimmer may in the end burn the whole house,'' said the rabbi. Only several thousand Jews remain in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from a pre-war population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6 million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have emigrated. `` There are so few of us left in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and it would be a pity if those few also left. I personally came after 45 years because I wanted the Jewry to rise again on this ruin,'' said <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON>, who survived the Lodz ghetto and <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1947. `` I would not like to leave it all again if anti-Semitism starts ... in which case these few thousand Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would lose their rabbi,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Rule Requires Power Cutoff During Major Factory Repairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday gave 631,000 businesses two months to guarantee that all power to machinery is cut off during major maintenance and repairs. It said the move would save 120 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries a year. The rule issued by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would add protections for 39 million workers, 3 million of whom are at the greatest risk because they service machinery, the government said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said employers must guarantee that the machinery can not be accidentally activated during repairs and maintenance and that workers can not be exposed to electrical current during that work. The rule requires most employers to guarantee the protection by installing locks that cut machines off from their power supply. It will cost the affected establishments $ 214 million in the next year for the necessary equipment and training and $ 135 million in subsequent years, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. Those costs will range from $ 120 for small establishments _ such as a small print shop _ to $ 28,000 for large plants with scores of machines, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said. The regulation, a decade in the making, is tougher in its final form than when proposed. The government initially said employers could either install locks to prevent accidental activation of equipment during repairs or place warning tags on the power source to alert workers that the machinery was being worked on and was not to be activated. The final rule places a greater emphasis on locks, allowing tags only when an employer can prove that equipment can not be `` locked'' off a power supply or that its tag program is as effective as using locks. Because of the additional training required to meet that threshold, it would cost employers more to use tags than it would to install locks, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> chief. He said 90 percent of electrically powered machinery is capable of being locked. `` We have so many fatalities, loss of fingers, crushed bones and other serious injuries because these precautions are not taken,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said in an interview. `` This will have a major effect on workplace safety.'' The provision allowing use of tags will not apply to new equipment or machines that are taken off line for major modifications, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. In those cases, locks must be used. The rule, which takes effect Oct. 31, also requires annual training of all affected workers. Employers also must inventory all equipment covered by the rule and establish a written plan for cutting off power during repairs. The standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing and in services such as industrial laundries. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> data show that packaging and wrapping equipment, printing presses and conveyors account for a high proportion of accidents blamed on a failure to cut off power during major maintenance and repairs. Typical accidents in such situations include electrocution and shock and getting limbs caught in moving parts when a machine lurches on. The rules do not apply to construction or maritime industries. As is its custom, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> will use separate rulemaking procedures to tailor the requirments to those industries. Separate standards also are being developed for utilities.

 World War II began 50 years ago Friday. One of many events marking the grim anniversary will be a concert in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the first target of blitzkrieg, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s fearsome `` lightning war. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> called the conflict `` the most horrible and destructive of all wars.'' An ultra-conservative West German Cabinet minister said Germans should not bear all the blame. More than 50 million people were killed in the war touched off by the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, 1939. The Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews shocked the world like no other atrocity. Major events are scheduled for Friday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including an internationally broadcast concert in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> conducted by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> used the occasion to declare: `` We have a duty to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of factors capable of triggering a similar conflagration.'' In the statement issued last weekend, he called the Nazi slaughter of Jews something `` which will forever remain a shame for humanity.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is to address his Polish countrymen Friday evening by means of a huge television screen set up in <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s old city. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday: `` The sad jubilee _ 50 years since the beginning of the most horrible and destructive of all wars _ requires that the world public not only learn the lessons of the past anew, but also determine guidelines for the future.'' Its commentary repeated Soviet calls for a reduction of armed forces and weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Neues Deutschland, the official newspaper of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The most important historical lesson of Sept. 1, 1939, consists of never again letting fascism return. In <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s native <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, which he occupied and annexed in 1938 without firing a shot, the popular tabloid Kurier is running a daily series it calls `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s War.'' `` It scarcely ever happened in history that the responsibility for a war was so clear,'' the newspaper said Monday. `` It was, in the end, the work of one man. It was <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s war.'' <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> has claimed to be the dictator's first victim. News media, politicians and intellectuals in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have used the anniversary for a review of Nazi atrocities. Special events included a concert Thursday night in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> featuring violinist <PERSON> Anne-Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutter </PERSON> and Polish composer <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Penderecki </PERSON> conducting his `` Polish Requiem.'' As a gesture of reconciliation, the government said it was willing to return the Polish Embassy in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, to Polish ownership. The far right in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has taken the opportunity to try to shift some of the blame. <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON>, the federal finance minister, said he did not want to deny `` one iota of German guilt'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era and the war, but declared: `` A one-sided view of history with the conclusion that only the Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead to dangerous condemnations.'' <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> did not say who should share the guilt, but many on the far right claim Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> also was responsible. The minister wrote in the latest issue of the Bayernkurier, party organ of his ultraconservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, leader of the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, spoke of the `` war guilt of the Soviets, who together with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> brought the people of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under their yoke'' _ a reference to the Soviet absorption of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> under a 1939 pact with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said an international panel of historians should be appointed to reassess whether Germans alone were responsible for the war. At a service in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, West German Jewish leader <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> denounced the resurgence of right-wing extremism in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Anniversary events in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> included a live hookup with the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> and Swiss radio Thursday night for a dicussion show about the causes of the war and the postwar division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The Council of State today appointed Comptroller <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> as president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as it moved to fill the vacuum created by the cancellation of the presidential election on May 7. The new government takes over Friday, the same day the term of acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> expires. Today's appointments assure the continuation of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as commander of the military, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, and as the country's de facto leader. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who resigned Wednesday night, said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was appointed president and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofores </PERSON> was named vice president. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> spoke with reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> met in closed session. There was no official announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, which is up of about 40 people, including <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, heads of government agencies and military leaders. The civilian president will be the formal head of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, which will continue to be controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Sources said the new government will abolish the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and replace it with 41 appointed legislators. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new government will evaluate the country's situation in six months before deciding on the possibility of holding new elections. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, an economist, has been comptroller for seven years. He is a veteran administrator who has held mostly economic positions. Government officials have refused to discuss what shape the government would take, but sources said Wednesday that it appeared it would consist of a junta with civilian and military representatives. The government will have the blessing of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who met today with current government officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and agency heads. Since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has demanded his ouster. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was to present new drug charges against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at a special meeting today of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, officials said. The 31-nation session was set at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request after <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week challenged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for evidence of its charges of drug involvement against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The government announced the arrest Wednesday of several members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on charges of planning sabotage activities, and increased security nationwide in anticipation of protests. Paramilitary groups organized into `` national defense committees'' trained at various sites in the capital, and government agencies announced they were placing themselves in a state of alert. But opposition leaders said they did not plan any street protests Friday. They said the arrests were part of a military campaign of propaganda and repression. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the new government would be a `` continuation of the military dictatorship.'' `` The changes are superficial,'' added former opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` They are thinking of a government junta,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. `` They are not thinking of elections.'' The winner of the presidential election held May 7 was supposed to have taken office on Friday. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was the opposition candidate and international observers said he won. But the government annulled the balloting, alleging that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference and support for the political opposition distorted the results. Opposition leaders complain that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has concentrated its campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges at the expense of the anti-democratic aspects of the government. `` Our argument with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is over the democratization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> added. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a different perspective.'' Opposition leaders say the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> was partial to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in failing to condemn the general and the government for annulling the presidential elections. <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> members could not agree last week on a declaration about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> based on a report by a special mission that visited <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> five times since May to seek a negotiated settlement between the opposition and the government. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he did not expect any favorable action by the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> at today's meeting `` unless there is a drastic change of attitude. I would be surprised if it happens.''

 The number of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children living with stepparents has risen sharply, as women have children before marriage and parents change spouses, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The number of children under age 18 living with a stepparent jumped 11.6 percent between 1980 and 1985, increasing from 6,082,000 to 6,789,000, the bureau reported. During the same period the number of children in biological families, that is, children living with both their natural parents, slipped from 39.5 million to 37.2 million. The findings on stepchildren were reported Thursday in `` Studies in Marriage and the Family,'' the first of a new series of special topical studies to be issued by the agency. The report contains sections on unmarrieds, single parents and married couple families. It summarizes information issued previously by the bureau, bringing together statistics on related topics in a single publication. The rise in stepchildren has occurred during a period when more divorces were occurring, giving rise to second marriages. For there to be a stepchild in a family, at least one of the parents had to be married twice or the mother had to have a birth prior to her first marriage, the report observed. As of 1985, the bureau found, 4,469,000 married couples included stepchildren in their families. Of these 2,387,000 included only stepchildren, while 2,082,000 families included both stepchildren and biological children of that couple. For stepchildren, the vast majority lived with their biological mother and a stepfather. Only 10.9 percent in 1985 were living with the biological father and a stepmother. Other detail reported in the new compilation included: _ The share of Americans aged 18 and over who are single increased from 28 percent in 1970 to 37 percent in 1988 _ The median age at first marriage was 25.9 for men and 23.6 for women in 1988 By comparison it was 22.8 for men and 20.3 for women in 1960. _ As of 1988, 10.1 percent of all adults who had ever been married were divorced, up from 3.8 percent in 1970 _ The number of unmarried couples living together rose from 523,000 in 1970 to 2.6 million in 1988 _ Between 1970 and 1988 the number of single parents climbed from 3.8 million to 9.4 million

 A judge suspended <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud and conspiracy trial today and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder committed for psychiatric testing after he was told <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> suffered hallucinations and was found cowering under a couch. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who was not in court at the time, to be taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION> to see if he is competent to stand trial. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s court order allows <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to be held at the institution for up to 60 days. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said psychiatric evaluations normally take about 45 days. A sobbing, disheveled <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was later brought to the courthouse, then taken away in handcuffs 90 minutes later to the mental facility. The fourth day of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s trial opened with his psychiatrist, Dr. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, testifying in a brief hearing out of the jury's presence that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` was lying in the corner of his attorney's office with his head under a couch, He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt him.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been treating <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for nine months, said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> suffered hallucinations after breaking down Wednesday when a witness collapsed during cross-examination. That witness, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, was back at the courthouse today, saying he felt better. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> reported that when he left the courthouse, suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animals which he felt were intent on destroying him, attacking him and hurting him,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> psychiatrist whom the prosecution dismissed as a `` hired gun.'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> summoned the jurors and told them the trial was being delayed, without saying why. He instructed them to check with the courthouse Tuesday to see if the trial would resume Wednesday. After <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> suspended the trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals drove <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> from his attorney's office to the courthouse. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' a deputy marshal said to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> after he curled up in fetal position in the back seat. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> asked that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be sent to an unidentified private hospital, but <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> instead ordered marshals to deliver <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION> facility. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had not agreed to be voluntarily committed. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> the defense had presented its motion for a psychiatric evaluation just 15 minutes before the trial was set to resume. `` This time he -LRB- <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB- did n't summon his client to come up to pray,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s praying over <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> when he collapsed on the stand Wednesday `` This time he summons a psychiatrist to come up here.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> wanted the trial to continue, quoting the evangelist as saying, `` I want to go to court. I want to be on trial.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told the judge <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> lay on the floor in a fetal position. It was not the first time that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was described as emotionally distraught since the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> scandal broke. His wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, said in a fund-raising letter to supporters last fall that he lay in a fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry in March 1987. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, continuing broadcasts of the couple's evangelistic cable television show Today's show made no mention of the morning court developments. It was taped earlier, said a woman who answered the phone at at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Ministries in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. The drama followed Wednesday's collapse of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who fainted during cross-examination. During the incident, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, prompted by <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, went to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s side and prayed aloud. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> recovered consciousness after 15 to 30 seconds and explained his fainting today by saying he had n't eaten anything in the past few days because he had felt ill. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive expected to testify against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for an undisclosed condition <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, 57, was sentenced to eight years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud and conspiracy relating to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising. He was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top aide when the evangelist quit <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and a $ 265,000 payoff for her silence. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> testified that he told <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> that `` lifetime partnerships'' good for lodging and other benefits at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> religious retreat and theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, had been oversold. `` I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` I specifically said, ` Someone could go to jail for this.''' When court recessed Wednesday after <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s collapse, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> broke into tears at the courthouse door. `` I ca n't go out,'' he told his lawyers. When attorney <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> moved to open the door, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> yelled: `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, do n't leave me here!'' After <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> returned to his side, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> regained his composure. If convicted on all 24 counts, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $ 5 million. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives diverted for their own use more than $ 4 million of the $ 158 million raised from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` partners.'' In the `` partnerships,'' $ 1,000 contributors were guaranteed three free nights' lodging each year for life at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. The ministry had one hotel and others under construction, but prosecutors say those lodgings could not support the more than 66,000 partnerships sold by the time <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Down as Growth Remains Sluggish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories slumped 1.7 percent in July to the lowest level in eight months, the government said Thursday in a report indicating that, although a recession appears remote, growth remains subdued. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for both durable and nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 231.3 billion. It was the lowest level since November and the second decline in three months. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June and fell 2.6 percent in May. Recently, a string of strong statistical reports have indicated that fears of a recession this year are overblown. Retail sales, personal income and housing construction all rose in July, while unemployment edged down. However, economists said Thursday's report, which showed weaker-than-expected factory orders, suggested the economy is still far from robust. `` The manufacturing sector is struggling,'' said economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` So far this has n't dragged down the aggregate economy, but it may yet. Forecaster <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> blames the slowdown on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s program during the first five months of 1989 to fight inflation by boosting interest rates. The policy has particularly hurt manufacturers that produce `` big ticket'' durable goods such as autombiles and appliances _ goods consumers usually buy on credit, he said. Since early June, the central bank has reversed course, allowing rates to decline slightly, but <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> noted, `` They've only backed off part way.'' `` Based on their statements, I do n't expect them to ease further and unfortunately that could be a disaster for the economy,'' he said. If weakness in manufacturing persists, it will lead to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate, he warned. `` I think it's already happening,'' <PERSON> MacReynolds </PERSON> said. `` I expect unemployment to rise through the rest of the year as a result of the slowdown that is happening now.'' In two other signs of sluggishness, shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.9 percent, the sharpest drop since March 1986, and inventories shot up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in five years. A runup in inventories without a corresponding increase in new orders can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots. `` The rise in inventories is a warning that, despite our good track record over the last several years in managing inventories, it is still possible that if the economy slows down, -LRB- rising -RRB- inventories can exacerbate a downturn,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of The <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting firm. The economists predicted that manufacturing will remain sluggish this year. The rise in the value of the dollar since late 1988 will take the edge off booming export sales, they said, and businesses, in turn, will purchase fewer capital goods, such as machinery and computers. In July, orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, fell 2.2 percent, a revision from last week's estimate of a 1.9 percent decline Orders for nondurable goods fell 1.1 percent. In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 5.7 percent in July after gaining 5.0 percent a month earlier. However, <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> noted the upturn was wholly concentrated in aircraft orders, which are booming as airline companies worldwide replace their aging fleets. A 38.3 percent increase in new orders for aircraft in July pushed the transportation sector up 2.6 percent, despite weakness in automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding. Much of the month's weakness was concentrated in orders for military goods, down 14.5 percent, and non-electrical machinery, down 10.5 percent. Orders fell for glass products, fabricated metal products, engines and turbines, construction and mining equipment, computers, electronic components and scientific instruments. They rose for communications equipment.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has received about 1 million signatures on a petition seeking a constitutional amendment against desecration of the American flag. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, appearing at a press conference with American Legion national commander <PERSON> H.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON>, said legislation calling for the amendment has been scheduled for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor action Oct. 16. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will consider a bill Sept. 12 that would create a federal law against flag desecration, but not amend the Constitution. `` It's a long process,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said of the amendment route, which requires approval by two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and ratification by three-fourths of the states. But, he said, the issue was one that deserved consideration by the states. <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON> said that the legion was getting about 40,000 signatures a day in its nationwide petition drive, which still goes on. `` The constitutional process requires constitutional assurances we'll do the right thing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., who also appeared at the news conference Proponents of the amendment say it, rather than a statute, is needed so that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will not rule the prohibition unconstitutional. Earlier this year, the court touched off the controversy by deciding that burning the flag was a constitutionally protected form of political protest. Many lawmakers and constitutional law experts oppose the amendment, saying that while emotionally offensive, flag-burning is not a serious enough offense to merit curtailment of free-speech protections. The House bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plus an unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag, and was drafted to address the high court's decision that existing statutes against flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech. Reps. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who also attended the news conference, said the fight in the House for an amendment would be much tougher than in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., has said the Democrats want to try a statute before a constitutional amendment to avoid `` adding political graffiti to the Constitution.

 The local Teacher of the Year ca n't have her job back despite her acquittal on charges of growing marijuana in her back yard because she knew her husband smoked pot, the school superintendent said Thursday. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> was fired after her arrest in May on charges she helped her husband grow marijuana in a vine-covered greenhouse. She could have received up to 11 years in prison but was found innocent by a jury Wednesday. After the trial, Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> said she felt vindicated and would try to return to the classroom. But Colquitt County Superintendent <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said he has no plans to rehire the former high school chemistry teacher. <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said she was fired for immorality for allowing her husband to use marijuana. He said the county <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> did not consider whether she was involved in possessing or growing marijuana. `` She admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on, that it was being used,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, 38, who was named <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 1989 Teacher of the Year, said Thursday she is appealing her dismissal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel great that finally the truth got out and I have cleared my name, which was my intent,'' she said. `` I had the truth on my side.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, were arrested May 19 when drug agents, acting on a tip, found 22 small marijuana plants growing in their greenhouse and drug paraphernalia in their house. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON>, a former teacher and lawyer, admitted chronic marijuana use and pleaded guilty to drug charges. He is awaiting sentencing. At her trial Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> testified she first learned of the marijuana in the greenhouse when she returned home and found her house full of drug agents and her husband in handcuffs. `` I felt betrayed by my husband because he had grown marijuana in my back yard,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> denied ever smoking or knowingly possessing marijuana and said her husband's use of it had been the only source of trouble in their 16-year marriage. They have two sons. Mrs. <PERSON> Sherling </PERSON> testified she had pleaded with her husband to stop smoking pot. `` I do n't know how often he smoked,'' she said. `` We have argued about this since our marriage. I have used every argument I could. I said, ` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, it is illegal.' I said, ` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> we have children. What if they find it?'''

 The main subgroup of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> urged Thursday that the commission take up the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pace </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights spokesman, said it was the first time conditions in one of the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members were referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The other permanent members are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A resolution adopted 15-9, in a secret ballot, by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities expressed concern about recent events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and `` their consequences in the field of human rights.'' It appealed to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities for clemency in dealing for those imprisoned after the army brutally suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in June. The resolution asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general `` to transmit to the Commission on Human Rights further information provided by the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other reliable sources.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rejected the resolution as interference in its internal affairs. <PERSON> Asbjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Eide </PERSON>, a Norwegian member of the subcommission, described the resolution as `` very conciliatory.'' He said the main purpose was to focus attention on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which includes delegates from 43 governments and will hold its next meeting in February. It is the highest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights body and can appoint special investigators. A Chinese statement Thursday said: `` This resolution contradicts the purpose of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter and runs counter to the norms of governing international relations. The Chinese government rejects this resolution. It is null and void and has no binding force on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> whatsoever.'' The resolution was sponsored by panel members from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Western delegates sought the secret ballot as a means of guarding the independence of the 26-member panel. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said at least 1,000 people were killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square when soldiers moved against the unarmed demonstrators June 3-4. It accused the Chinese government of secret executions and mass arrests. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denied the charges. At a weekly briefing Thursday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> claims of a `` wave of repression'' after the crackdown `` are entirely ungrounded and unreasonable.'' `` An extremely small number of people used terrorist means and took violent actions in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government,'' he said. `` That the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, according to law, arrested those criminals and sentenced them to imprisonment is entirely legitimate and justified.'' `` No country or organization has the right to interfere in an issue that is purely another country's internal affair.''

<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has turned from being a lender into a `` grant agency'' and that he is determined to put it on a more business-like footing. `` We've just got to reform that program, take it out of the status of what it's really become _ a grant agency _ and move it back to being a credit institution once again,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. The FmHA has its roots in the Great Depression of the 1930s and is often called the government's farm lender of last resort. To be eligible for loans, farmers must be unable to get regular loans from banks or other commercial institutions. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency has `` made billions of dollars of questionable loans over the last decade or so, many of which are in default today.'' But he noted that attempts have been made to change <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> and to toughen its lending practices, only to be thwarted by legal action filed by farmers or their advocates, or by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we have to change legislation in this area in order to do a more effective and skillful job of managing -LRB- FmHA -RRB-, we'll make legislative proposals to have that happen,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told a television news conference. `` If we can do it administratively ... we'll do it that way.'' For years, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> has been embroiled in controversial attempts to collect long-overdue farm loans. New procedures to help protect the interests of farmers and to enable the agency to proceed with its collections were included by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The latest move involves FmHA sending out a new batch of collection notices to borrowers who failed to make their scheduled payments by the first of this year. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>'s county offices were told to mail out the collection notices by Aug. 25 so that delinquent borrowers could have them by Sept. 1. The county offices were sent lists of delinquents totaling 13,217 borrowers as of Aug. 1 and were instructed to delete names of those who had settled their accounts since then. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said those deletions possibly could reduce the list to between 11,000 and 12,000 names by the time they were mailed out last week. `` But we wo n't get an actual count until farther down the road,'' he said. The list of delinquencies has shrunk dramatically since Jan. 1 when it was more than 30,000 borrowers he said. By July 3 it was down to 15,704 names, and the Aug. 1 count dropped to 13,217 _ the basic list sent to county offices. Borrowers will have 45 days from receipt of the notices to return forms to FmHA describing how they want to settle their overdue accounts. The 1987 law requires the agency to tell farmers they have certain options, including reamortization or rescheduling, payment deferral, reduced interest rates and, in some cases, debt forgiveness. If farmers do not respond, or if a borrower is in such poor financial shape that no alternative can be worked out, forced sale or foreclosure proceedings could begin. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the latest notices are in addition to more than 66,000 sent out last fall to delinquent borrowers, many of whom had not made payments for three years or more. The total owed FmHA by all delinquent borrowers is around $ 8.7 billion, although there is no breakdown showing how much the 1989 notices involve, he said.

 An alleged Nazi war criminal who fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to avoid deportation to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been charged with war crimes, a state prosecutor said Thursday. <PERSON> Boleslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, will go on trial in state court in <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>, 84, faced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deportation proceedings for war crimes allegedly committed when he served as a policeman in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. He fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>, who was charged in August, is being held in the hospital wing of a prison in the city of <LOCATION> Bochum </LOCATION>. In 1965, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sentenced him to death in absentia for his alleged role in burning down a village and helping to kill more than 130 men, women and children in the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Audrine </LOCATION>. The deaths occurred while he was acting as commander of a pro-Nazi police force during World War II. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began deportation proceedings against <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> in 1976, but that was delayed by several appeals. His last appeal was denied by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, and he fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Cites Conflict of Interest in $1 Billion Contract Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official violated a conflict-of-interest law by participating in the award of a $ 1 billion contract to a group of companies that included one of his former employers, a federal judge found. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Claims Court Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, in a finding released Thursday, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> had violated the federal statute prohibiting an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> supervisor from participating in department decisions involving any energy company that the supervisor has worked for within the past year. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> is acting director of the department office administering a program to evaluate <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, as a possible site for building the nation's first permanent repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s finding on <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> was a central feature of a ruling he handed down last week that blocked the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from giving a $ 1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Yucca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> management contract to a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based engineering and construction giant. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> agreed with a contention by <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an unsuccessful bidder, that <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> should not have been involved in weighing the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> team's bid for the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> project. The Cleveland-based company said <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> had previously worked for one of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>'s partners, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a San Diego-based engineering and consulting firm that has played a major role in the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> project as an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contractor since 1983. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s finding. `` I ca n't respond, since I'm a key party to the case,'' he said in a brief telephone conversation. The department issued a terse statement Thursday saying it was reviewing <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s ruling and evaluating its `` legal and operational options,'' and that in the meantime it would answer no questions about the matter. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said the department was not ruling out the possibility of seeking civil penalties against <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, even though government lawyers had argued during the six-week Claims Court hearing last spring that there was no conflict of interest. The conflict-of-interest statute at issue in the case allows for civil penalties of up to $ 10,000 for each violation, to be imposed by the department head or a federal court. In an interview earlier this week with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> said he had acted in good faith and believed no conflict of interest had been shown by lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, which had sued department over <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>'s role. `` I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, no thoughts to that regard and I do n't see where any conflict of interest has been shown,'' he said Monday. The gist of the ruling was made public last Thursday, but <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> sealed the actual opinion to allow the companies involved to review the document for any proprietary information or trade secrets that should not be publicly disclosed. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s ruling has broad implications for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is struggling to revive a nuclear waste disposal program that has been plagued for years with costly delays, scientific uncertainties and stiff opposition from the state of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> worked for Science Applications from October 1985 to May 1986. He started working in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear waste management office in June 1986. He was chairman of a department panel that studied the various <ORGANIZATION> Yucca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> contract bids and recommended on Dec. 2, 1988, that the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> team be chosen the winner. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asserted in the Claims Court hearing that there was no conflict of interest because, among other things, <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> was not aware during the restricted one-year period after he left Science Applications that the company was interested in the contract. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, however, said he found `` clear and convincing evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> actually knew -LRB- or at least should have known -RRB-'' of Science Applications' involvement in the contract bidding process. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> rebuked government lawyers for arguing that the desirability of enforcing conflict-of-interest laws is not reason enough to conclude that it would be in the public interest to block the department from awarding the contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> team. `` This court will not sit idly by and blink at such transgressions on the part of government officials acting under the misguided assumption that such conduct does not harm the public's faith in the integrity of the procurement process,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> wrote

<HEAD>Palace Says Royal Couple to Separate But Not Divorce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the royal couple rarely seen together, on Thursday admitted the open secret of their life apart with a palace statement that they are separating, although have no plans to divorce. The announcement ended rumors of strife that have dogged <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s only daughter and her commoner husband for more than half their 15-year marriage. It was the second time this century that a marriage in the immediate royal family has broken down. The queen's sister, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, separated from Lord <PERSON> Snowdon </PERSON> in 1976 and they divorced two years later. `` Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, and Capt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> have decided to separate on terms agreed between them,'' said the short palace statement. `` There are no plans for divorce proceedings.'' If they want to file for divorce, British law requires them to live apart for two years. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> will live at the family estate <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with their two children _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>, 8 _ while <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> will move to a home nearby, the palace said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s father, Maj. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, said Wednesday night that his son will move to <ORGANIZATION> Aston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> on the estate. The decision to split up was `` taken in principle earlier this year,'' added a palace spokeswoman. The queen, who was at her <LOCATION> Balmoral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, was said by palace sources to be saddened but understanding. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 40, have been spending up to half the year apart, and tabloid newspapers have speculated about extramarital attachments for both. The two avid equestrians met in 1968 at a dinner for the British Olympic riding team and their glittering 1973 wedding in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abbey </LOCATION> was broadcast to 500 million TV viewers. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> was attending an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> when the separation was announced, and refused to answer reporters' questions. Although she appeared unperturbed, a source close to her said she was upset by the attention. The princess, who is seventh in line to the throne, was not due back in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> until mid-September. She will fly Friday to <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> on a four-day trip on behalf the Save the Children Fund, of which she is president. From there, she was scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, who travels widely to teach riding and run various equestrian businesses, was at <LOCATION> Gatcombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, 80 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and also was silent. Sharing a passion for horses, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> have competed in Olympic equestrian events and won riding championships. But over the years, they drifted apart. At the 1984 and 1988 Olympics they stayed in different hotels, and last year spent their 15th wedding anniversary thousands of miles apart. A former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> describes himself as `` quiet and shy'' and a farmer at heart. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, who has a biting wit and down-to-earth manner, was known as `` Her Royal Haughtiness'' in the 1970s for her often cold and brisk manner. But that image changed in the early 1980s, as newspapers began to notice her devoted work for the Save the Children Fund, an international charity. Her courage in visiting dangerous corners of the globe, and her willingness to roll up her sleeves and work for the poor and hungry, made her one of the most respected members of the royal family. She is a patron of more than 75 charities and 23 military groups. On April 6, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest-circulation tabloid, reported it had been handed four stolen letters written to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> by a man who turned out to be a palace aide and navy officer, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>, 35. Late in August, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> left the queen's service to take command of a frigate but was awarded the Royal Victorian Order for `` extraordinary, important or personal services to the sovereign or the royal family.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said at that time that his marriage was `` fine and happy.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartland </PERSON>, romantic novelist and a step-grandmother of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s sister-in-law, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, said changing times and public morals played a part in the breakup. `` Up to now royalty was on a pedestal, they were n't treated as ordinary human beings,'' she said. `` Now you've treated them like human beings I'm not surprised they behave like human beings.''

<HEAD>Bomb Detector May Be Ineffective Against Some Explosives, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 1 million bomb detector that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> starts operating Friday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airport is not sensitive enough to spot an explosive like the one that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 last December, Science magazine reports. The magazine, the journal for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, said the bomb detector, called a thermal neutron analysis device, or <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION>, is being set at a sensitivity that will uncover about 2.5 pounds of plastic explosives. Science said that British experts believe the bomb that brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21 contained only about one pound of explosive. The crash killed 270 people. A <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> bomb detector has been installed in a special building at <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and will go into operation for international <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flights on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The agency said that it wants <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to spend about half a billion dollars to install 491 of the machines at international airports over the next five years. The bomb finder is a 10-ton, 13-foot-long machine. It uses neutrons, a type of sub-atomic particle, to probe luggage for the presence of nitrogen, a major component of explosives. The luggage passes through the machine on a conveyor belt and if nitrogen of a certain level is detected, the machine indicates the source, enabling operators to seperate suspicious bags. Science said the machine is so massive that it requires special construction to install, increasing the cost of deploying the $ 1 million machine. A problem with the system is that some types of fabric, leather and such things as plastic ski boots can have nitrogen densitities are high as explosives. `` If heavy trunks and woolen clothing are involved, it becomes hard to distinguish a real bomb from background readings, creating false alarms,'' the magazine said. To avoid an excess of false alarms, Science said the machine will be operated at a sensitivity to detect about 2.5 pounds of plastic explosives. This sensitivity, the magazine said, will produce a false alarm rate of about 5 percent. On a fully-loaded jumbo jet, such a false alarm rate would represent about 30 pieces of luggage that would require special handling, the magazine said. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, the director of the office of civil aviation security for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the false alarm rate for the detector that goes into operation on Friday could be as high as 5 percent, but he declined to discuss the level of sensitivity used in the device. `` It seems to me to not be in anybody's best interest to make those kinds of disclosures,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` This technology can be programed to find a full range'' of explosive devices. He said the false alarm rate may be reduced to 2 percent to 3 percent when the detector is teamed with an X-ray system. The device would detect the possible presence of explosives and the X-ray would actually examine the interior of each piece of luggage. The <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> currently can not be used to check carry-on bags. The technology involves the use of ionized radiation which has some potential health hazard, the magazine said. `` It is n't applicable to passenger screening,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> agreed. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said that suspicious bags detected by the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> device will require some special handling, but he believes that any delay in flights will be minimized. He declined to describe the special handling. Science magazine said that the airlines are not happy with the prospect of even a 5 percent error rate. `` The airlines can not cope with such large requirements for hand-searching luggage and they want to reduce the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> machine's alarm rate'' to about 1 percent, the magazine said `` The rate that they would face if the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> machine were adjusted to scan routinely for 1-pound bombs would be unacceptably high, and thus the machine would almost never be used this way.'' <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleman </PERSON>, on the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> government operations subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, said there was concern among members of the committee that the device will not protect against small size bombs. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AM </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 bomb would have gone right through,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Holleman </PERSON>. She blamed the sensitivity setting used on the insistance by airlines to hold false alarm readings to a minimum. `` The airlines can not function in a commercial way with more than a certain number of false alarms,'' she said. Congressional hearings on the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> machine deployment have been announced for Sept. 26 by Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., who chairs the government operations subcommittee

 Wildlife officials will split the only captive colony of endangered whooping cranes to reduce the chances of disease or disaster wiping out the flock. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said this week that 22 of the 54 birds at the <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will be sent in November to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs in one basket, literally,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Trauger </PERSON>, the Patuxent center's deputy director `` The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do that.'' The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds, known for their elaborate courtship dance, under a joint program with Canadian wildlife officials. A wild flock of the cranes migrates to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the winter from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 2,400 miles away. This year, 138 made the migration. Before conservation efforts began, there were only 21 whooping cranes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in the winter. Scientists hope that by breeding whooping cranes in captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said today they stand ready, in <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s words, to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> `` stomp out'' the terror of drugs In a seaside news conference at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation home, the two leaders chatted about what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called `` an unusually productive visit,'' that included airing differences on two trade issues: lobsters and pork. But the two leaders, both casually dressed, directed most of their attention to international issues, including ongoing efforts to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. On the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has thwarted the scheduled transition to democracy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged feeling `` a high frustration level'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to dislodge the dictator. But he added: `` We are not going to give up on this. We are not going to permit the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be thwarted by this dictator.''. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I've never seen a coming together in world opinion as there is on this one ... that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ought to get out.'' After the two leaders concluded their 35-minute news conference, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> predicted the president's new anti-drug package will cost $ 7.8 billion _ almost $ 2 billion above current spending levels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will unveil it on Tuesday. Asked whether he favored use of a multilateral military to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> wipe out the drug cartels, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` The main thing is to cooperate with President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> in the ways that he feels -LRB- would be -RRB- most effective.' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` There is no point on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or ... any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is now trying very, very hard to rid itself of this menace.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were in `` complete agreement ... -LRB- on -RRB- the need to support a very courageous leader in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the need to stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was `` broad'' agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on trade, `` there are still bumps in the road.'' Asked whether he favored a multilateral force to fight <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug cartels, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did n't want to `` do something or say something that would be counterproductive and turn public opinion ... against President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s efforts. But he said `` an international effort on whatever line it is _ aid, help of any kind _ would be useful.' On the lobster dispute, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said: `` The president was big on lobsters today. I was big on pork because we feel that the Americans have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork.'' He said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork dispute under the Free Trade Agreement. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` advanced some persuasive arguments that I have instructed my officials to begin examining'' on the lobsters. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobstermen say the Canadians catch lobsters so small they have not even had a chance to reproduce. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who leaves with his family later today, said they had been swimming, boating, and doing other activities, including `` a little fishing by me.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> throughout his 16 days here on vacation, caught nothing. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> offered `` the impartial international assessment of the fact that there are no fish out there. I can certify to that. It's not the president's fault. On another issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was considering increasing emergency food shipments to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` That is one -LRB- area -RRB- where we ought to be able to do more,'' he said.

 A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official last year urged repeal of a program to assist the homeless, but several <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> officials warned against such a move in an election year, according to documents released Thursday. `` Such an effort would undoubtedly be unsuccessful and could unfortunately be interpreted as a lack of in interest in the plight of the homeless by this department, thus subjecting the secretary and the administration to strong criticism of a politically sensitive and visible issue during an election year,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> official wrote in response to the recommendation from then Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>. In that memo, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Docksai </PERSON>, then the department's assistant secretary for legislation, also warned that it would be `` politically untenable'' to attempt to repeal the program, under which the government was to fund efforts to screen the homeless population for people eligible for Social Security. The memo in which <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> made the recommendation to then-HHS Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> and a number of subsequent internal HHS memos discussing the idea were released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homelessness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION>, which had criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for not implementing the program. The documents show that while several <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials appeared to agree with <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s recommendation, they did not believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would agree to the repeal and also suspected that even suggesting such a move would hurt the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in last year's presidential election. The law center obtained the documents under the Freedom of Information Act. `` We agree that the department should not seek an appropriation for the program,'' Assistant Secretary for Health <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> wrote in an April 1988 memo. `` However, if we actively work to repeal the legislation, the administration risks being portrayed as uncaring for the homeless. Since nothing is happening at the moment, silence seems the best policy given the politics of homeless issues.'' In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the advocacy group said the program still has not been funded. `` This policy is reprehensible; it is also illegal,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON> of the law center said in the letter to <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` I ask that you reverse this policy by implementing the outreach program at once.'' A <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> spokesman did not immediately return a telephone message left Thursday. The program was authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. It was designed to create an HHS-administered pilot program under which the federal government would provide money to state and local governments that established teams to identify homeless people potentially eligible for Social Security benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized $ 3.75 million for the program and said up to $ 1 million should be taken from <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> surplus funds to pay for implementation of the program.

 An American Jesuit priest who was jailed by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for criticizing the government said Thursday the church's greatest recent achievement was helping oust the former president. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, made the remarks during ceremonies at which he was awarded the 1989 Ramon Magsaysay Prize for journalism, literature and creative communications arts. A Malaysian, an Indian, a South Korean and a technological school in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> also were honored by the <ORGANIZATION> Magsaysay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The awards were presented Thursday by the Foundation on the 82nd birthday of the late President <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Magsaysay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The most spectacular contribution of the Church to the world in recent years, through media, was EDSA,'' said <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON>, referring to a highway where mutinous soldiers took control of the military's headquarters to start a four-day revolt that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency `` It was the first revolution in history to be run by radio,'' <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> added. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> led by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s Archbishop Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> called on the people to march in the streets as a sign of support for the rebellious soldiers Sin's call was made over the church's radio station <ORGANIZATION> Veritas </ORGANIZATION>. Troops loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> destroyed the Church's transmitter but the radio station continued airing information about the revolt using another radio station. `` It was an accident of history that the Church was in position at that time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> said. `` we had the equipment. We had the personnel. We had the organization. And we had the courage to do it.'' Reuter, who has lived in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for more than 40 years, ran a weekly newsletter that had been critical of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> rule. When martial law was declared in 1972, the newspaper was closed and he was placed under house arrest for two years. The other winners were Zakiah Hanum binti <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> for government service, <PERSON> Sri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakshmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for public service, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Im-soon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for community leadership, and the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pilot's License Now Easier to Obtain, Despite Objections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 New regulations designed to make it easier and less expensive to learn to fly went into effect Thursday over the objections of federal air safety regulators and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The new rule would permit issuance of a so-called recreational pilot's license after only 30 hours of flight instruction, compared with the 40 required for a regular license. The recreational license will permit pilots to fly only within 50 miles of the airport where they learned to fly. They may fly only in the daytime and in clear weather and may not use airports with traffic control towers. `` We are hoping this is going to provide a stepping stone,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are going to get into aviation as a result of this, because it is going to be less expensive.'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> hopes many of them will then go on to get a regular pilot's certificate, helping to fill a growing shortage of airline pilots. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the board has long opposed the new license. `` I am in sympathy with the problem we have of getting more people involved in aviation,'' <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said. `` It's just that I'm not convinced that that's the right way to go about it.'' `` I do wonder how they can adequately enforce the many restrictions that have been put on,'' he said. The new rule was first proposed in 1979. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will reduce the cost of learning to fly by as much as 39 percent, from about $ 3,000 to less than $ 2,000. The license will limit the pilot to planes with no more than four seats and 180-horsepower engines. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, director of engineering and air safety for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the association plans to renew its objections to the new rule, which is still subject to revision. `` It does cost an awful lot for a young person coming up through the ranks to try to get a private pilot's license today,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` And if there is any means of reducing the cost of that license, then we might provide more pilots and a larger demand for airlines and a larger group of pilots for the airlines to select from.'' `` This seems to make sense, except that by getting a recreational license you certainly are n't getting the kind of training necessary to go on to flying with the airlines or making yourself a good, safe, sane pilot,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has remained silent this week on the possibility of a trip by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, while apparently keeping up diplomatic efforts to arrange such a mission. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters on Aug. 25 that `` different practical possibilities are being studied so that this desire of the pope can be carried out'' and contacts were under way `` on different levels.'' Since then, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have declined to elaborate on the statement. The pontiff first said Aug. 15 that he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to pray for peace there. But several obstacles have cropped up to a possible papal trip, including a recommendation by the pro-Iranian leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Sunni Moslems that the pontiff be kidnapped A previously unknown Islamic organization also threatened in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Monday to kill <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> if he visited <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has frequently expressed anguish in recent weeks about the six-month battle between Christian troops and Syrian-led forces including Lebanese Moslems. The fighting has claimed more than 810 lives. On Wednesday, during his weekly general audience, the pontiff appealed once again for prayers for peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> media have also been quiet on a possible papal peace mission since Sunday, when the director of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> defended such a trip in a front-page commentary. `` Certainly, those who carry out politics only with the criteria of craftiness and slyness ca n't understand the logic of care and the most deeply felt testimony -LRB- of the pope -RRB-,'' wrote director <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>. He did not say who he was referring to. Some Lebanese political figures have said a papal visit would express support for Lebanese Christians.

<HEAD>Famed Tenor No Longer Welcome at Chicago Lyric After Cancellation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and his high C's have been banished from the <LOCATION> Lyric </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, where officials say they tired of hearing the same old song after he once again canceled his appearances for the season. `` Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>,'' said general director <PERSON> Ardis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>. `` I'm very sad about this. ... But I did n't have any choice. A lot of people have been very mad about his cancellations.'' The last straw came when <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, 53, canceled six performances as <PERSON> Cavaradossi </PERSON> in <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` Tosca,'' scheduled at the Civic Opera House for late September and early October, citing an inflamed sciatic nerve, Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled performances with the Lyric since 1981, she said. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>'s New York-based manager, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>, said he spoke with the tenor Thursday at his home in <LOCATION> Modena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> issued a statement saying that he agreed `` there should be no future collaboration'' with the Lyric. `` It is true that most of the cancellations in my career have happened with the <ORGANIZATION> Lyric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, so I understand very well the disappointment that they have,'' <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> said. `` I have never been a canceler and I do not like to cancel my appearances in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because they have a beautiful audience and theater there.'' `` I can say that if I am not good luck to the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, then perhaps the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is not good luck to me.'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said he considered Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON>'s reaction `` a little bit irrational.'' `` I think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of spite for the Lyric Opera of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which is absolutely wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> had written and advised the Lyric that the tenor `` can not subject himself to the rigors of a live operatic performance'' because the inflamed sciatic nerve, near the hip, left him unable to move extensively on stage. The singer requires two months of therapy, <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Krainik </PERSON> said she `` did everything possible to try to convince'' <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> to appear, even suggesting that he sing the role from a chair. `` His medical problem, while certainly a concern, is apparently not affecting his voice,'' she said. The singer rejected the idea. Lyric spokesman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said the opera had received more than 100 calls from fans Thursday, nearly all of whom supported the decision not to do business with <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>. Outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, opera experts were more understanding. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, managing editor of Opera News, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said such cancellations are not unique. `` The man is a serious artist and I do n't think he would cancel if there was n't a valid reason for it,'' she said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, director of administration for the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> _ where <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> left the stage in May when his voice cracked in the third act of `` Tosca'' _ said he would be returning to do a concert in 1990. `` He gave a very heroic effort in attempting to complete the opera even though he was ill with bronchitis,'' Ms. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` He did n't want to disappoint the audience.'' <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> said the singer is discussing returning to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1991 for engagements with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and at <LOCATION> Ravinia </LOCATION>, the outdoor summer music theater. Health and family problems have forced <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> to cancel various performances in the 1980s. In April 1985, the tenor called off a performance with the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> because he was fatigued and indisposed, in part because of his excessive weight. In 1984, his youngest daughter became severely ill and the tenor spent much of his time at home. A replacement for <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> in `` Tosca'' is expected to be named within several days, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. The Lyric, with 32,000 subscribers, has sold 99 percent of its 3,550 seats for the coming 35th anniversary season.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scrapped plans to go next month to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, still embroiled in controversy over the Exxon Valdez oil spill, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, which never was finalized or officially announced, would have been part of a mid-September swing to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The trip may be rescheduled for the spring, officials said., There were various reasons voiced privately by administration officials on why the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> trip was dropped Chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporers covering the president's vacation here that logistical problems and weather conditions caused the cancellation He said there was a possibility it could be rescheduled for the spring. But another official said the main reason for dropping the trip was a feeling that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already had a full schedule for September, with several important policy issues, and that the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> trip would not do him any good politically. `` Something had to give, in what was already shaping up to be a busy month,'' said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two officials denied that weather and logistics were the reason for the cancellation, as indicated by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in his public statements. The purpose of going to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would have been to examine the progress of the cleaup of the 11-million-gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker on March 24. The spill swept masses of gooey oil on the once pristine beaches along Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was said to be very intent on going, sources said. But one source said other officials prevailed with advice that it would could do him no good to refocus attention on the Valdez oil spill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized in the aftermath of the spill for not moving quickly enough to get the federal government involved in the cleanup. Initially administration officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup efforts were satisfactory. But eventually, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said those efforts had been inadequate and ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to assist in the cleanup. Winter weather conditions are the reason also given for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to shut down its cleanup efforts in mid-September Environmentalists have criticized the pullout plan, contending some aspects of the effort could continue. Critics also are blasting a government plan calling for all studies on damage caused by the spill to be completed by Feburary. Environmentalists say the plan could lead to a serious under-estimation of harm to the environment and a limited recovery of damages from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a heavy legislative calendar in September, and is trying to focus attention on his drug strategy which he unveils on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 The Moral Majority called it quits Thursday, but not before it made history by helping to marshal the religious right into a political force in the last decade. After raising $ 69 million from 6 million people, helping elect three <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations and rallying conservatives behind issues ranging from abortion to pornography, the lobbying group officially disbanded a stroke before midnight Thursday, the end of the fiscal year. `` The Moral Majority acted as a catalyst, as an energizer for the conservative movement. It had a major impact on bringing a new voter bloc into the political mainstream,'' said President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nims </PERSON>. By Thursday, however, <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> said he was the last employee on the job. `` I'm standing on the bridge until the gun goes off.'' It was 10 years ago in June that the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> gathered religious leaders from around the country in his office conference room in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION> to discuss how to get conservatives involved in politics. `` It was really a brainstorming meeting,'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> -LRB- president of <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- who actually said in that meeting, ` I believe there is a moral majority in this country,' and somebody said, ` That's the name.' That's how it all started.'' <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who carried the sword that carved out a permanent place for the religious right in politics, is now devoting his time to his expanding ministry _ <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> _ and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> resigned as president of Moral Majority in 1987 and announced two months ago the organization would meet its end Thursday. He passed the position to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nims </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> entrepreneur who was <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s chief executive officer during <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s brief, beleaguered leadership of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> said the plan had been to slowly dismantle the organization, which had a dozen employees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 20 in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION> when he took over, to avoid damaging the conservative movement. `` My specific job was to wind it down in an orderly fashion so we would n't trip going off the stage,'' he said by telephone from his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office. The group also wanted to remain intact through the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the presidential election, <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> said. `` We did n't want a major headline right in the middle of a major battle battle: ` Moral Majority Quits,''' he said. The last legislative fight ended in December with passage of the Child Protection and Enforcement Act, which <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> said will help get organized crime out of the pornography industry.

<HEAD>EPA Tightens Controls on Cancer-Causing Benzene Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government issued tighter controls Thursday on cancer-causing benzene, saying the new restrictions will eliminate 90 percent of benzene releases from industrial sources ranging from steel plants to service stations. But the curbs are expected to be quite costly _ and they do not cover the primary source of benzene pollution, automobiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation that would tighten air pollution standards, including provisions to reduce benzene releases from motor vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the agency also plans to announce separate regulations next month to reduce vapor releases _ including benzene _ from automobiles. In its announcement Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said new emission control equipment may force industry to spend nearly $ 1.3 billion, with another $ 200 million annually in maintenance costs. `` These will be costly, but feasible controls,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. He conceded that in some cases a company may choose to close an aging plant instead of install the new equipment. The agency could provide no estimates on how many such shutdowns might occur. <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> predicted the new rules likely will be challenged in court, but said he was determined to enforce them vigorously. The regulations, some of which will become final immediately while others were expected to become final within six months to eight months, would cut industrial benzene emissions by 34,000 tons a year, or by about 90 percent, over the next two years. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> first listed benzene as a hazardous air pollutant in 1977 after chronic exposure to the colorless and odorless liquid was found to cause adult leukemia, birth defects and other disorders. Benzene usually escapes into the air after evaporating from gasoline in automobiles and from a range of industrial sources including iron and steel plants, oil refineries, chemical and pharmaceutical plants as well as during transit and delivery to storage tanks at local gasoline stations. The new EPA rules cover only emissions from industrial sources, which account for only about one-fifth of the benzene released into the air annually, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Automobiles account for nearly 80 percent of all benzene released into the air. Other sources are cigarette smoke and various consumer products. The regulations announced Thursday came 12 years after the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> first began considering curbs on industrial benzene pollution. While some segments of industry have curbed such releases, they remain largely uncontrolled in other areas such as iron and steel, where benzene is a major byproduct of coke production. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said its new rules would cut benzene emissions by 97 percent in the steel industry. Sizeable emission reductions also are expected in the transportation of benzene, in the pharmaceutical industry and in the distribution of gasoline from refineries to local service stations, the agency said. The tighter rules are expected to reduce the cancer risk to the general population from industrial benzene exposure to less than one in 1 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates. But <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> conceded the risks could continue to be greater to individuals _ perhaps a risk of as much as one in 10,000 _ for as many as 300,000 people who live close to industrial plants where high levels of benzene are present. `` It is riskier to live near a factory that emits benzene. ... I do n't know what we do -LRB- to eliminate that risk -RRB- short of closing -LRB- the plants -RRB- all down,'' <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> told reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that of the nearly 40,000 tons of benzene released yearly from industrial sources, about 40 percent comes from the iron and steel industry's coke production. The agency said the cost of bringing 36 coke furnaces and foundaries into compliance with the new regulations would be $ 74 million. By far the largest costs are expected in the petroleum industry, which may have to spend as much as $ 930 million on new emission control equipment for its gasoline storage, distribution and marketing operations, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates. Those costs, however, will be spread over thousands of facililities from bulk gasoline storage plants to individual service stations, officials said. Benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for not moving more quickly to curb releases of such substances. There are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must make annual reports of releases.

 The pro-Iranian leader of fundamentalist Sunni Moslems was quoted Thursday as saying Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> should be kidnapped if he visits <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged Christians. Sheik Said <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> also recommended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> be abducted as a means of ending support for Lebanese Christians and for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Ad-Diyar </ORGANIZATION> reported. Seven people were killed in artillery and rocket exchanges between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and Christian soldiers, including a 27-year-old woman who burned to death in an apartment set ablaze by shellfire, police reported. They said at least 36 people were wounded. By police count, 812 people have been killed and 2,354 wounded, nearly all of them civilians, in the artillery war that began March 8 between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army command and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A mediation mission by French envoy <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> appeared to have collapsed, raising fears of intensified fighting. An artillery round hit the second-floor apartment of <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Najjar </PERSON>, 33, a sound technician with the British television agency Visnews. Neighbors said he carried his 8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son down the stairs, but returned to find the charred body of his wife, Amal, lying in the flames. Ad-Diyar quoted <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> as saying in an interview: `` If the pope comes to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and we manage to hold him for the sake of salvaging Palestine, I would n't be against such an act. `` It is our duty to abduct all those related to states that recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Every citizen of a foreign state that recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be a hostage in our hand. `` I support the abduction of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and ... <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to serve the purpose of ousting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and stopping the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> intervention -LRB- in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB- and the naval warships that have come to rescue <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s children in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Although <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> is a Sunni, he supports the radical Shiite Moslem goal of an Iran-style Islamic repubic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and has made several trips to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. His reference was to six French warships in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which governed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by mandate until 1943, says the ships are on a `` humanitarian'' mission, to evacuate the 7,000 French citizens in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if necessary. <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON>'s talk of abduction was the most overt threat to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> since he expressed a desire Aug. 19 to visit <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and help end the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, which has killed more than 150,000 people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has advised him to stay away. Threatening to kidnap the pope may seem farfetched, but <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> carried out suicide bombings against American, French and Israeli forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1983-85 and have kidnapped scores of Westerners. Sixteen Western hostages, including eight Americans, still are held. Police said Syrian artillery deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the mountains south and east of the capital hit the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave with up to 20 shells a minute Thursday. They said scores of 240mm and 180mm mortar rounds exploded at and around the hilltop presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command bunker is under the palace, a regular target of Syrian fire. His 155mm howitzers fired on Syrian positions along the sectarian dividing line in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the seafront boulevards of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the wooded <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> hills southeast of the capital, police said. One salvo landed at the <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION> junction, which is south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on the coastal highway linking the Syrian-controlled sector of the city with the rest of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Syrian soldiers scrambled from sandbagged checkpoints and dived into foxholes along the seafront. Dozens of apartment buildings on both sides of the city were set afire and burned out of control because the shellfire kept firefighters from reaching them. Ad-Diyar said the shelling increased because <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON>'s mediation effort foundered on differences about halting arms supplies to the rival factions. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> wants international guarantees that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would stop arming its allies. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> wants an inter-Lebanese committee to make sure ships bound for Christian ports do not carry weapons and ammunition for the Christians. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, an Arab enemy of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, is <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s main arms supplier. <PERSON> Scheer </PERSON> ended two days of talks with Lebanese leaders Wednesday and is expected to visit <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. An Arab League summit in May appointed the leaders of those three nations _ King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> _ to find a solution to the Lebanese crisis by November. They announced July 28 that their efforts were stymied, blaming <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s refusal to withdraw its soldiers Syrian troops are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976.

 Just say no to drugs and pregnancy and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> will say yes to full college scholarships for low-income students, Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> announced Thursday. The $ 50 million program approved by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> would serve as many as 10,000 third-graders a year beginning in 1991 and continuing through 2000. Now the state must persuade third-graders and their parents to enlist. Students would be tutored and paired with `` mentors'' throughout elementary and high school, and top performers would receive summer jobs where they could serve as role models. In return, students and parents in the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Crusade must allow state monitoring of report cards, shun drugs and early pregnancy and obey the law The only academic requirement is that they do n't flunk. `` We really feel that if the program is successful, we may have made a fundamental change in certain patterns'' that contribute to students dropping out, said <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrocelli </PERSON>, the state's higher-education commissioner, who designed the program <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said students who ran into legal problems or became pregnant should be given a chance to get back into the program if they showed willingness to continue their studies. The plan seeks to cut the dropout rate among disadvantaged students in half, to 25 percent. An estimated 1,200 of the students who finish the program each year would attend college and 1,200 would go on to jobs or other training programs as a result, said <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>'s senior assistant, who is in charge of raising the funding. All third-graders could enroll, but the program is aimed at approximately 3,200 who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or whose families receive food stamps, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. Businesses, foundations and schools would be asked to contribute the initial $ 10 million to a foundation. The state would be expected to contribute $ 3.2 million a year, bringing the fund, with interest, to approximately $ 50 million after 10 years, Ms. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> also said he would be `` knocking on the door of the White House'' to at least to match the state's contribution. There was some doubt, however, about whether the parents of disadvantaged students would sign them up. `` I do n't think the parents that do n't care, that they're going to even bother with this,'' said <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Ley </PERSON>, 12, who serves as a tutor in one of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>'s poorest neighborhoods. `` Some parents do n't care, and I have a few friends who have parents like that.'' `` I'm not so sure,'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said when the comment was repeated to him. `` I think they might say, ` Thank God. Give us a hand.''' The maximum scholarship would cover the estimated $ 3,436 yearly tuition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> in the year 2000, and would increase 5 percent yearly, <PERSON> Petrocelli </PERSON> said. Students attending other <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> schools and apprenticeship programs or proprietary schools would receive less. Students attending private colleges would receive the maximum scholarship.

<HEAD>July Prices Paid to Farmers Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products dropped 1.4 percent from July to August, leaving the monthly average at a year-ago level, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans, corn, lettuce and potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease from the July average. Higher prices for cattle, apples, eggs and grapefruit partly offset the decline for the other commodities. Oilseeds, which include soybeans, and feed grains showed the greatest month-to-month decline, while meat animals and milk had the largest increases. `` A 90-cents-per-bushel decline in the price of soybeans from July to August was the largest month-to-month decline since June-July 1984,'' the report said. `` Corn and sorghum prices were down but the average barley price was up.'' Wheat prices moved up after four months of small declines. Hogs and beef cattle were up from July, but calf prices were down slightly. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said earlier Thursday that he expects 1989 will be `` a good year'' for farmers, although there is `` a mixed situation across the country'' because of drought and other weather problems. `` I would guess net cash income -LRB- nationally -RRB- would be slightly below 1988, but not very much below,'' he said. Crop production generally has rebounded from last year's drought-reduced yields and exports are up. `` Overall, I'd say farmers feel a lot better,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. Department economists say net cash income of farmers _ gross cash income minus cash expenses _ rose in 1988 to a record of about $ 60 billion as drought forced commodity prices up. Many producers were able to sell harvests at the higher prices, thus more than offsetting reduced production. The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower federal subsidies. Consumer food prices are forecast by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to rise an average of 5 percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase in 1988. Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock and livestock products as a group increased 1.9 percent from July and averaged 5.3 percent above the year-earlier level. Crop prices, overall, dropped 4.5 percent from July and averaged 5.9 percent less than in August 1988. The all-fruit price index for August was up 8.8 percent from July but was down 4.9 percent from a year ago, the report said. Apples were reported at 16.1 cents per pound, compared with 9.8 cents in July. A year ago apples were 24.5 cents per pound. Grapefruit prices averaged $ 7.24 per box, compared with $ 4.62 in July and $ 4.09 a year earlier. As used in the report, a box of grapefruit is about 67 pounds. Prices of commercial vegetables dropped 15 percent from July, averaging 6.5 percent below a year ago, the report said. The overall index of prices paid to farmers in July averaged 144 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from 146 percent in July. That was the lowest reading since November when the index was also 144 percent. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 69.60 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 68 in July and $ 65.90 in August 1988 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as bee. _ Hogs averaged $ 46.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 45.90 in July and $ 44.70 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.29 a bushel, was down from $ 2.47 in July and $ 2.65 in August 1988 _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.83 per bushel, compared with $ 3.78 in July and $ 3.61 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.20 per 100 pounds, down from $ 7.33 in July and $ 7.43 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 5.93 per bushel, compared with $ 6.83 in July and $ 8.33 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 64.3 cents per pound, up from 60.6 in July and 53.9 in August 1988 _ Eggs were 71 cents per dozen, up from 64 cents in July and 58.1 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 12.60 in July and $ 11.80 a year earlier _ Broilers were 36.1 cents per pound, live weight, down from 39.1 cents in July and 42.3 cents a year ago

 The judge in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra case Thursday ordered a hearing on whether the former national security adviser may introduce evidence that covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels was legal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to discuss whether there was valid evidence that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> could use to defend the charge that he obstructed congressional inquiries into whether <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August 1986 by assuring three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees in letters that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was observing `` the spirit as well as the letter'' of a ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he wanted to determine if <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> should be given a chance to prove he had no motive to conceal <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities by showing they were `` legal, authorized, or known throughout the government.'' At issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or other government officals could be presented as evidence that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> thought the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was following the law. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said he would also hear arguments on whether the existence of other covert operations by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could also be cited as evidence that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> thought North's activities in support of the Contras did not violate the congressional ban. No date has been set for the trial of <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who is also accused of lying and helping devise a false chronology of U.S.-Iran arms sales in November 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began its investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Authorities Charge Grandparents Of 4-Year-Old In Pen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple kept their 4-year-old grandson in a filthy, outdoor pen next to dog kennels for most of each day with a bottle of water and no access to a toilet, authorities charged Thursday. `` He looked like a caged kid, a wild kid that had been caged up and you'd find out in the woods somewhere living with the animals,'' said police Cpl. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Doty </PERSON>. District Attorney <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON> filed a misdemeanor charge of `` omitting to provide'' against <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The charge, usually filed in cases of failure to pay child support, carries a year in jail or a $ 500 fine. Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said her grandson was kept in the pen to keep him from running onto a highway. She said he was safe there and kept cool under large trees. Investigators said the boy appeared to be well-nourished and had no apparent injuries. But <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON> said, `` If the pen were sanitary, if you were talking about an outdoor play pen, that might be reasonable.'' <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON> said the boy was confined to the 100-square-foot pen from morning until night. He said the boy used a corner of the pen as a toilet and had a dirty baby bottle of water to drink. The pen is next to a kennel with dozens of dogs. The boy was `` filthy from head to toe,'' said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howland </PERSON>. The boy, an 11-year-old cousin and the Whites' 13-year-old daughter were taken into custody Tuesday by the state. Child welfare investigators will hold a hearing to determine if the children should be returned to the home or placed in temporary custody elsewhere. The Whites and the children have been living in a motor home at a site where the Whites are trying to start a commercial kennel, officials said. <PERSON> Howland </PERSON> said the boy's mother left him with the grandparents when he was 2, and the boy's father apparently works in another city.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> sent a top-level envoy to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> Thursday in a cautious new step toward reconciling one of the Arab world's bitterest conflicts. However, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s decision to send an envoy to celebrate Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s 20th anniversary in power _ and not attend himself _ indicated the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> leader remains unwilling to forget more than a decade's conflict with his western neighbor. Government sources say this wariness is due largely to <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s frequent changes of mood toward <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> The current rapprochement began in May, when fellow Arabs enticed <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to sit with <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> at an Arab League summit. They hugged, then met privately for several hours. Since then, their desert border has been reopened and air service between the countries restored. Each has ended invective against the other. But they still have no diplomatic relations, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is waiting for <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to restore relations he ruptured in 1978 after <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, began peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s invitation to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to attend the anniversary celebrations of the coup in which <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> ousted King <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> is itself progress. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s acceptance was another step forward. He designated as his representative Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Waly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waly </PERSON>, who flew Thursday to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, is the most senior <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since 1977 when the two countries fought a five-day border war. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> fell out with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1972 when <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> spurned <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s proposal to merge their countries Relations deteriorated as <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> pursued his peace policy and rapprochement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> blamed <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for bombings in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> and other cities in 1975 and 1976, which led to the war. Since <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> took office in 1981, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> envoys have embarked on more than a dozen futile secret missions to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> publicly said they always brought expressions of friendship, yet each trip was followed by hostile Libyan actions. That was before this spring's summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. On May 23, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> met there and agreed to bury the hatchet. About relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told the Yugoslav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Thursday: `` They are improving steadily.

 More than 10,000 Poles roared their applause as <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> joined them Thursday to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the birth of Solidarity and pray for the success of the new Solidarity-led government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union, had much to celebrate this year. The union emerged from seven years of banishment to end 45 years of communist control of the Polish government. `` On Aug. 31, 1980, I signed in your name the document which became the basis for the creation of Solidarity and which changed the course of Polish history,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told his cheering supporters. `` We reject the road of violence and revolution, but we have the right to use legal measures. We want to have a government really capable of changing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and really responsible in front of Solidarity and its allies and in front of the nation. `` It is our duty to make sure that is what happens. Remember at the end, it is always the nation, the ordinary people, who decide.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a shipyard electrician and 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, drew cheers as he took his seat in front of the towering workers monument in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, where Solidarity was born. Sitting next to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was a special guest, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, the `` Courier from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>,'' who smuggled information out of Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during World War II and who long headed the Polish section of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-financed Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, becoming an enemy of the communist state for his uncensored broadcasts. Solidarity's <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who became prime minister last week, said in a television address he could not join the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> commemoration because of the pressing need to form his new government. Dozens of delegations from mines and factories across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> dipped Solidarity flags at the monument honoring workers killed during 1970 workers' riots along the Baltic coast. Two parachutes lettered with `` Solidarity'' fluttered from poles near the shipyard entrance. Exactly one year ago, the shipyard was strikebound for the second time in four months and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for his first talks in six years with communist authorities desperate for a solution to nationwide labor unrest. Later that day, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and successfully appealed for an end to the strikes. His discussions with authorities led to the start in February of talks on political and economic reform. After the historic negotiations came restoration of Solidarity's legal status April 17 and June elections that were the freest in the Soviet bloc in four decades Solidarity's stunning victories and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s disastrous showings led to the unprecedented possibility of power-sharing And on Aug. 24, as a result of a parliamentary coalition forged by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> between Solidarity and two smaller parties long allied with the Communists, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became prime minister. `` We enter a new epoch. It depends on us when we will be able to say <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is a free, democratic and wealthy country. Now I say that next year, we will be thankful for visible economic acheivements,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said over TV, `` I very warmly greet all my friends from those times that we spent together in such hard, dramatic, but I think fruitful, circumstances. I am with them during these solemn ceremonies.'' <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> was overcome by emotion as he stood to address the assemblage. He returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Tuesday for the first time since fleeing at the end of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Uprising of 1944. `` It seems absolutely impossible I can stand in front of you,'' <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> said. `` Solidarity, although defenseless, opened a road to me for my own country with its spirit. `` Not so long ago, what I would have faced here would have been a death sentence.'' An outdoor Mass was celebrated by <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON>, who wore robes embroidered with `` Solidarity'' in red glitter. `` Today we can be real co-partners in truth, be those who will build the new reality of our homeland,'' <PERSON> Goclowski </PERSON> said. Piles of bouquets, two framed photos of Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and a wooden cross decorated the main gate of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Glos </PERSON> <PERSON> Wybrzeza </PERSON> marked the anniversary in a front page article under the headline `` Hope.'' `` Almost all of us remember that day ... From August 1980, not only nine years have passed, an epoch has passed. Especially the recent months were filled with changes that stunned the world,'' the paper said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> responded to business pressure Thursday and delayed for two months implementing a tax rule that encourages companies to provide health and life insurance benefits to all their workers. The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rules is Dec. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate that health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favor higher-paid workers. The original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had been delayed until Oct. 1. Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether, arguing that it is so complex, costly and time consuming that it will drive some small companies out of business They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended and that companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them to all workers. Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. One, which has passed both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but must be reconciled before going to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would delay implementation until Oct. 1, 1990. A second bill, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would revamp but not rescind the rules and postpone the effective date until Jan. 1.

 With nothing but blueberries for food and the wisdom of years to guide him, a 95-year-old miner survived three weeks lost in the wilderness with little more than sore feet to show for the ordeal. `` I knew the Good Lord would rescue me,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said after he was found Tuesday northwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` As for being scared as that no one would find me, well, I never even gave it a thought.''

 A leading private environmental group said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was not doing enough to help Third World countries combat the threat of rising global temperatures. The bank, owned by 151 governments, is the largest source of aid to the Third World, lending over $ 19 billion a year. `` The status quo is not acceptable as an option,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, senior attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. His criticism was based on an internal bank paper prepared in advance of a major speech on the environment that the bank's president, <ORGANIZATION> Barber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conable </ORGANIZATION>, is due to deliver in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Sept. 11 The paper includes a section entitled: `` The Bank Can Do More.'' `` This document is the equivalent of saying that hats and sunglasses will solve the problem of stratospheric ozone destruction,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said in a statement on the paper. One threat to the environment foreseen by some scientists is that chemicals released on Earth are destroying the layer of ozone, a gas in the upper atmosphere that protects the planet from harmful rays of the sun. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogl </PERSON>, the bank's chief spokesman, said the paper was only one of many inputs for <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>'s speech and for a new `` operational directive'' the bank is preparing. `` The statements of a tiny number of environmentalists fail to acknowledge the immense volume of undertakings by the bank,'' he said in an interview.

 A bomb strapped to an ice cream vendor's bicycle blew up at a paint factory in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Thursday, and drug traffickers vowed to intensify their terror campaign by killing more people The attack on the paint factory in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the heartland of the nation's cocaine trade, injured 13 people and caused $ 300,000 in damage, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>'s fire department said in a statement. About 20 cars were damaged, a police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. The bombing followed the first night of a curfew imposed in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and eight nearby towns. Police reported a series of bombings that caused minor damage in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> as the curfew went into effect Wednesday night. About 530 people were arrested through dawn Thursday for violating the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> set Sunday as the target date to begin shipping weapons, aircraft and other supplies under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 65 million military aid package for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drug traffickers. The bombing of the paint factory in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> was the latest in a two-week wave of assassinations, arsons and bombings by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug traffickers in retaliation for a government crackdown on the narcotics trade The radio networks <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said they had received telephone calls from an anonymous man claiming responsibility on behalf of `` The Extraditables,'' a group blamed for past violence linked to drug traffickers. `` At nighttime, when bombs are placed there are few victims, but there will be more victims now because we will place the bombs at daytime when there are more people in the city,'' the caller told the radio stations. Until Thursday, most of the bombings have been at night, although an Aug. 24 bombing of a political party headquarters in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> killed a passerby. The same group on Aug. 24 issued a statement declaring `` total war'' on the government in response to a crackdown on trafficking after the Aug. 18 assassination of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate. The group apparently speaks on behalf of the 12 Colombians that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants extradited to stand trial for drug violations. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s Medellin-based cartels are believed to supply up to 80 percent of cocaine that reached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Drug lords are trying to force the government to abandon attempts to extradite traffickers and have killed scores of officials. In an effort to protect jurists, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided Thursday to keep the names of judges handling drug cases a secret. In the last 10 years, 220 judges and other court employees have been killed. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, judges handle both the work of a judge and of a prosecuting attorney in questioning witnesses and suspects, reviewing evidence and deciding whether someone should be charged. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s decree, judges will remain out of view when questioning witnesses or suspects. The bomb that exploded Thursday at the paint factory was in a box on the back of an ice cream vendor's bicycle, which had left leaning against a retaining wall around a paint storage tank, <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> news reports said. Just before the curfew went into effect Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, men threw grenades at a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> country club building. Two grenades exploded, but there was little damage and no injuries, a police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. About the same time in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, men firing shoulder rockets narrowly missed gasoline storage tanks belonging to the state oil company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION>, the police spokeswoman said. Police said they assumed the planned attacks were the work of drug traffickers. In the western city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded in a union office Wednesday night, police there said in a communique. The bomb did little damage to the office, which was inside a soda pop bottling plant, the police said. Meanwhile, leftist guerrillas resurfaced after a period of quiet during the two weeks of bloodshed by drug traffickers. Army troops and gunmen battled in the northern state of <LOCATION> Cesar </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and troops killed five of the gunmen, news reports said. The radio network <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> identified some of the men and quoted military sources as saying the five dead men were members of a paramilitary group. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this year that many of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s paramilitary groups are run by drug traffickers. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the men were leftist guerrillas. Elsewhere, peasants in the northern state of <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION> told military authorities there Wednesday that leftist guerrillas had executed 10 of their own men for treason, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiemp </LOCATION> reported. In the northeast state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>, where guerrillas have been active for years, two policemen were fatally shot, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, the bodies of four men were found in a stolen taxi on Wednesday, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said. Two gangs of drug traffickers have been waging a battle for power that has killed 180 people during the last year. Police in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> killed seven kidnappers who held captive <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, son of a Colombian industrialist. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 22, abducted on June 6, was rescued unescathed. His kidnappers were demanding $ 10 million for his release.

 A council controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> named one of his high school classmates as provisional president Thursday and said the timing of new elections depends on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> _ Cabinet ministers and heads of agencies and the military _ chose <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to head the government and said elections could not be held until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and `` aggression'' ended. It said the situation will be evaluated in six months to determine whether elections are possible. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who holds the real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as head of the military and police, is a member of the council and is presumed to control it. He and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> were close friends in high school and graduated in 1957. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who has spent most of his life as a government administrator, takes office Friday when acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s term ends. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> finished the term of <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was dismissed after trying to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last year as chief of <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. International observers said the opposition candidate won the May 7 presidential elections by a 3-1 margin, but the government annulled the vote on grounds the results were `` distorted'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference and economic aid to the opposition. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. At a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a man of `` shameless excess,'' who amassed a fortune of up to $ 300 million from drugs and other criminal activities. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> made the allegation in response to a challenge from a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> diplomat last week for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to back up charge charges. Chosen as provisional vice president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozores </PERSON> <PERSON> Typaldos </PERSON>, a leader of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and deputy director of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estrella </ORGANIZATION>. The Council of State said the national legislature would be abolished and the government would rule with a legislative commission of 41 appointed members. It said the government would rule by decree until the commission was selected. City governments will be replaced by appointed officials and the new government will draft a new constitution, the council said. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has lived a historic moment today as a free and sovereign nation and within its laws,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said after the announcement that his friend would become president. Political opposition leaders have called the new government `` a continuation of the military dictatorship.'' <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was chosen `` because of the knowledge he has of the country's economic situation and balanced judgment he has exercised in his decisions.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is in an economic crisis aggravated by the two-year confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to the comptroller's office, the gross national product declined 17 per cent in 1988, the worst drop since 1945, and more than 30,000 jobs were lost. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has has withheld fees for use of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> since March 1988, has stopped payment of taxes on salaries of <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> employees and has frozen <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government funds in American banks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say normal relations can not be resumed with a government <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to kidnap the general. Sandbagged fortifications have been built around the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and other military installations. Military units of the two countries have been had several confrontations in which, as a diplomat put it, `` they have come pretty close to shooting.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and is charged with protecting the canal until the end of 1999, when it will be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges against him are part of a plot to renege on the 1977 treaties and keep the canal.

 <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> agreed Thursday to peacefully settle a border dispute that began when <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s tanks crossed the desert and invaded northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> in 1973. Authorities said the two countries signed an accord to settle sovereignty of the 45,000-square-mile <LOCATION> Aouzou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> within a year, or let the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in The Hague decide.

It comes nearly a year after the countries restored diplomatic relations and a day before <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> celebrates the 20th anniversary of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s seizure of power. It is a sign of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s recent efforts to break his country's isolation in the Arab world <PERSON> Ibn </PERSON> <PERSON> Oumar </PERSON> and Libyan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Djadallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Azouz </PERSON> <PERSON> Talhi </PERSON> signed the agreement before Algerian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Boualem </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessaieh </PERSON>, who helped mediate. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> annexed northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>'s mineral-rich <LOCATION> Aouzou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in 1973, citing an unratified 1941 treaty between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s then colonial ruler, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. By 1984, Libyan forces supported by Chadian rebels had invaded much of northern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>. They were chased out with help from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> soldiers in a series of victories in early 1987, but retain their hold of the <LOCATION> Aouzou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Details of the accord were worked out at negotiations Aug. 21-25 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the French Foreign Ministry confirmed. According to a copy of the agreement made available by the <ORGANIZATION> Chadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> also agreed to sign a friendship treaty and leave the disputed area under the administration of a group of African observers until its sovereignty is decided. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> holds about 2,000 Libyan prisoners and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it has freed most Chadian prisoners. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which keeps 1,500 soldiers in southern <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, praised the accord and `` the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries.''

<HEAD>New Form Of Speed Dubbed `Ice' is `Real Horror Story'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ice, a potent new form of the drug known as speed with a high that lasts 12 to 24 hours, is on the streets in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and is threatening to invade major <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ports. `` This is a real horror story,'' <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Captain <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Ice, a colorless and odorless form of the stimulant methamphetamine, is smoked much like crack, the highly addictive rock form of cocaine. But unlike a crack high, which lasts less than half an hour, a few puffs of ice can keep the user high all day. Ice has been found at all levels of society in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` It's a nightmare here, and there is still only a glimmer of understanding of its long-term effects,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bent </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` Only now are we learning that its high is many times more potent and longer than crack, that its low is deep, morbid and entrenched, and that its addiction is at least as great as crack and possibly far greater.'' Most of the ice in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> appears to be coming from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` Normally, we are not on the cutting edge of something like this,'' said Major <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> police narcotics squad. `` Drugs usually come here from the mainland heading west; but this drug is coming from the opposite direction _ the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` Its couriers are not <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gang members like the Crips and the Bloods, but gang members from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who are just as deadly. We have become their test tube for smokable crystal meth.'' Ice costs two to three times the current price of crack cocaine, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> police said. While crack might cost $ 2,000 a pound, ice is $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 for the same amount.

<TEXT>
 On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, Poles from <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> remembered the conflict with sadness Thursday and vowed `` War Never Again.'' `` They fell on the field of glory!,'' shouted soldiers assembled for a torchlight ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. In a symbolic roll call, an officer read out a list of groups of the fallen _ soldiers, sailors, pilots and the millions of civilians killed in camps and forgotten forests _ and the honor guard replied: `` Honor to their memory'' `` War never again!,'' the officer shouted. `` Never! Never! Never!,'' the guard responded. The alarm read on the day of the Nazi attack by then-Mayor <PERSON> Stefen </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzynski </PERSON> was replayed, and the wail of sirens as the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> bombers approached once more sounded in the twilight. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, wearing his army general's uniform, saluted as he approached the tomb to lay flowers portraying the white Polish eagle in a sea of red. Beside him was Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the longtime Solidarity activist who last week became <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-communist government leader in 45 years. On Friday, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> will speak at <LOCATION> Westerplatte </LOCATION> on the Baltic coast, where the first shots were fired, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> will lead a memorial concert in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. But a key event bringing together members of the world's religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a boycott by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s only rabbi He said he is staying away because the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has not removed a convent from the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the estimated 2.5 million Jews who died there. The World Prayer for Peace project began Thursday with a solemn convocation at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> led by Polish primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> and attended by leaders of many world religions, including Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Hindus and Buddhists. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> was joined by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who noted <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was the first country visited by the war and remembered the 6 million Poles who died. `` War destroys man and his material and spiritual heritage, but it is man alone who sets it ablaze,'' the general said. `` Opposing war means ... -LRB- engaging in -RRB- dialogue, tolerance and mutual respect, including endorsing the sovereignty of states and the rights of nations to self-determination.'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> spoke of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s difficult past _ `` a country that suffered greatly ... preserving always its deep religious and spiritual values.'' The primate, who has been criticized for insensitivity to Jews, said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was a tolerant country where Catholics and Jews had lived together. He said Jews were the most numerous religious community besides Catholics in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> before the war and `` suffered the greatest persecution.'' `` In terrible death camps organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, Jews were killed for the sole fact that they were Jews,'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said. He departed briefly from his text to say he had made the same point Saturday, in a homily about Polish-Jewish relations that later was criticized by some Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders as being insensitive to Jews. Elsewhere, Castle Square in downtown <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> was decorated with a huge sign in English reading `` War Never Again,'' and in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> referred to the war Thursday as `` that great human stupidity.'' The conflict began at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939. The German battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on a garrison of 182 Polish soldiers on the <LOCATION> Westerplatte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in the port of the <LOCATION> Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Danzig </LOCATION>, and German troops fired on the city's main Polish post office. At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> `` blitzkrieg'' _ lightning war _ began without warning, an invasion by 1.5 million German troops that was to obliterate the last organized Polish army units by Oct. 5. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored treaty obligations and declared war on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> on Sept. 3. Poles continued to fight _ in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the underground <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as pilots in the Battle of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or in Gen. <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Anders </PERSON>' army that crossed <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and in the East under Soviet auspices. Poles were among the Allied troops who entered <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on May 9, 1945. The Solidarity-dominated Polish <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted a statement on the war that said the anniversary should be a day of `` new horizons of reconciliation.'' Nearly one out of every five Poles died. Victims included 3 million Polish Jews swallowed up in the Holocaust, 15,000 Polish officers believed massacred on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 200,000 residents of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> who died in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising, and boy and girl scouts who organized underground resistance units.

<TEXT>
 An unusual mix of <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaguers </ORGANIZATION> and western cowboys, the band of volunteers who formed the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s World War II mountain division, holds a unique place in American military and skiing history. More than 44 years after their victories, the veterans of the 10th Mountain Division still get together regularly to reminisce and enjoy the fellowship of the men they once fought against. `` The division's record was most phenomenal _ never defeated, never pushed back,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> businessman and founder of the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> holding a reunion here this week. `` It was something that happened once in our military history,'' he said. `` After the war, the German commanders labeled the 10th Division the elite unit of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Army.'' The division was the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> unit of infantry-division strength ever trained specifically for high altitude and cold weather fighting. `` You had quite a conglomeration _ men from <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, because that's where the skiing was, and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> cattle ranchers,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Made up of skiers, mountain climbers and survival experts _ supported by a group of cowboys, mule skinners and blacksmiths _ the 10th captured key <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> strongholds in the <LOCATION> Apennine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in early 1945. That paved the way for the final Allied thrust into the <LOCATION> Po </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dolomite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Inspiration for the division came from <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s ski troops in 1939, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Russian invaders `` were literally stopped for the winter by a very small unit of men on skis,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` That was a graphic example of how a skilled unit of men on skis could stop an invasion force.'' Finding skilled skiers was n't easy. `` There were n't many in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at that time,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who still skis at age 70. `` There were more skiers at <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> -RRB- during Christmas week than there were in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1939.'' Veterans of the division helped create the nation's post-war ski industry. The division, which had 14,000 troops at one point, was sent in mid-1944 to fight its way up the mountains of northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. More than 2,000 mules carrying supplies and howitzers accompanied the division, which took heavy casualties, with 992 men killed and more than 4,100 wounded. Many members of the division were also first-generation Austrian and German immigrants, who had been given the option of fighting the Japanese rather than having to face soldiers from their old countries, said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. The white ski suits, cold weather tents and mountain skis the division used are on display this week at the division's reunion. `` You'd be soaking in sweat if you were in one of those tents and it was n't 20 below,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Felix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, a rock-climbing specialist who lost his left leg in combat and won the Silver and Bronze stars and the Purple Heart. The 10th veterans also have forged ties with mountain fighters from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Participants from those countries were in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> this week and will be at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soliders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> that starts Friday in <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>. `` There's very little refighting of the war that goes on at these,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` In addition to the war experience, you had another great love that binds us all together _ the love of the mountains.''

<TEXT>
 An explosion in a 12-unit, three-story apartment building less than a mile from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> killed a man on Thursday and injured three people, sending rubble flying a full block away. Police believed the explosion was caused either by natural gas or propane. Witnesses said they smelled gas immediately after the blast at about 9:30 a.m., but there was no confirmation the explosion was caused by a gas leak. Two hours after the explosion, firefighters rescued a middle-age woman trapped inside her apartment. She was taken to a hospital. Three other people were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Ottawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> earlier. One man, not identified, was pronounced dead on arrival. A dog brought in by police searched for more possible victims. Flying debris damaged cars and nearby downtown buildings. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, the landlord of two nearby buildings, said the explosion sent `` huge chunks of concrete, the size of television sets'' hurtling through the air. Cab driver <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Legault </PERSON> was returning to his nearby apartment when he heard the blast. As he ran toward the building, he encountered a dazed and bleeding woman. `` She was delirious and was crying that her 7-year-old son was still in the apartment.'' <PERSON> Legault </PERSON> said he ran into the building and saw a man lying halfway out of a doorway in a pool of blood. `` He was covered with blood and his head had deep cuts in it. I checked and I think he was dead.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalina </PERSON>, 36, who lives one block north, said the explosion `` sounded like someone was kicking our door in.'' The building is in a fashionable neighborhood of renovated older homes, townhouses, boutiques and restaurants.

 Police arrested demonstrating students, journalists and trade unionists Thursday, and anti-apartheid activists announced nationwide protests of next week's segregated elections. Acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said police arrested nine guerrillas who planned violent disruptions of Wednesday's parliamentary elections, which exclude blacks A bomb exploded Thursday night at a community center in a mixed-race township outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, police and witnesses said. No one was seriously injured. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police banned a defiance rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>, then fired repeated volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of students who reassembled each time they were dispersed. Police, who were seen charging through campus buildings in search of protesters, said they arrested 10 blacks. An estimated 5,000 mixed-race high school students in the city boycotted classes to protest the elections. Police raided the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> home and office of <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general secretary of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, and later arrested about 10 members of the labor federation who protested the action. `` The raids ... were a blatant form of intimidation and disruption of our legitimate activities,'' <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said. `` At no time did the police specify what offense they were investigating.'' The explosion near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> rocked a community center housing offices of an anti-apartheid organization in a mixed-race township, police and witnesses said. It occurred shortly after several meetings broke up in the building. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which caused minor damage. Also in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, 12 journalists protesting media regulations under the state of emergency were arrested. Nearby, about 25 black squatters were arrested outside a government office where they were demanding improved services and an end to evictions. In <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police detained five activists involved in planning a weekend protest by blacks on a whites-only beach. One of them, <PERSON> Curtick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndlovu </PERSON>, is a senior official of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. A police spokesman, Gen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, said `` quite a number'' of political activists had been detained without charge in the past two days, but gave no details. The <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>, the trade union congress and other major anti-apartheid organizations said national protests of the elections would take place Tuesday and Wednesday. Emergency regulations prohibit calls for general strikes, but previous national protests have taken that form. The groups also calls for a month-long consumer boycott starting a week after the elections. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in a speech at a police college, said nine guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and 10 collaborators had been arrested in the past week. He said police seized a `` big quantity'' of Soviet-made limpet mines, rifles and hand grenades which allegedly were to be used in terrorist attacks to disrupt the election. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> includes segregated mixed-race and Indian chambers, as well as the dominant white chamber. Many anti-apartheid leaders of all races oppose the elections because the 28 million black majority is excluded. Activists and police have clashed almost daily since the launch of a defiance campaign Aug. 2. The civil disobedience has included protests against whites-only schools, hospitals, beaches and buses. Meanwhile, three blacks were killed in ongoing factional violence in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, police said. The conflict is between supporters of militant anti-apartheid groups and the more conservative Zulu political organization, <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, emerging from a seaside retreat, said Thursday they explored ways of providing more help for Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> in his battle against the drug barons. But both leaders, pressed on the possibility of sending a multilateral force to fight the drug cartels, stressed that any such appeal must start with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and not be imposed upon the Latin American nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There is no point in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or ... any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is now trying very very hard to rid itself of this menace.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said they were in `` complete agreement ... -LRB- on -RRB- the need to support a very courageous leader in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and the need to stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs.'' In a windy, seaside news conference, the two leaders also renewed their condemnation of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has thwarted democratic rule in his country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who played host to <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and family for a 26-hour stay here, called it `` an unusually productive visit'' that despite its private nature included almost four hours of talks on world issues and U.S.-Canadian ties. Both men wore yellow sports shirts and casual slacks while their wives, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 88-year-old mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s children stood watching them field questions on the lawn between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tennis court and the blue sea, dotted with brightly colored markers from lobster pots Lobster, in fact, was one of the few areas of strain in U.S.-Canadian relations, and <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> allowed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` advanced some persuasive arguments'' about Canadian lobstermen's catch of lobsters that in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters would be too small to keep The Americans contend the Canadian catch lobsters before they grow big enough to reproduce. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was broad agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on trade, `` there are still bumps in the road.'' On the lobster dispute, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said, `` The president was big on lobsters today. I was big on pork because we feel that the Americans have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork.'' He said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork dispute under the Free Trade Agreement. The Canadian leader said they were making progress on acid rain, thanks in part to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recently proposed Clean Air amendments. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he wants a U.S.-Canada bilateral clean air accord `` and I wo n't be satisfied that the issue is resolved until President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I sit down and sign that accord.'' `` We agree on almost all the major issues,'' said the president. `` And where <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> may have bumps in the road, we can talk very frankly.' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the national drug strategy he will unveil next Tuesday will not slight drug interdiction efforts abroad to expand drug enforcement at home. Afterwards, his chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, predicted the drug package will cost $ 7.8 billion, almost $ 2 billion above current spending levels, and require a reallocation of resources. On another issue, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was considering increasing emergency food shipments to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` That is one -LRB- area -RRB- where we ought to be able to do more,'' he said. On the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I've never seen a coming together in world opinion as there is on this one ... that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ought to get out.'' He said he had just received a letter from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I am not going to give up on multilateral diplomacy,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There's a high frustration level. I'm ready to concede that. But we are not going to give up on this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We are not going to permit the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be thwarted by this dictator.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who came with his wife, <PERSON> Mila </PERSON>, and four children, encountered the same luck as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he tried fishing. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> offered `` the impartial international assessment of the fact that there are no fish out there. I can certify to that. It's not the president's fault. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I positively guarantee you that this jinx will be broken'' before he heads home Monday from his 20-day vacation.

An overriding concern at the monthlong conference, which ended Wednesday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was that civil war would resume when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulled its forces out Sept. 27, leaving the army of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> to fend for itself. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 and overthrew the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime of <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, which was held responsible for 1 million deaths during less than four years in power. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Naruedol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejpradiyuth </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> army spokesman, said Thursday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> he doubted the Vietnamese pullout would be complete but still expected a renewal of the war in neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He spoke at the monthly army news conference. A Vietnamese radio broadcast said guerrillas encamped near the border already were trying to push soldiers and civilians into the Cambodian interior `` to provide a legal status for the so-called resistance ... before a cease-fire takes effect and elections are held.'' Delegates and observers note the Vietnamese departure comes at the beginning of the dry season, the traditional time for intensified combat in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Although it may have been inadvertent, the conference left time for military confrontation with its decision to renew contacts within six months about resuming peace talks. `` Without results on the battlefield, there are no results at the negotiating table,'' said <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> <PERSON> Sereywath </PERSON>, spokesman for the delegation of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> ruler who leads the guerrilla alliance. `` We were deadlocked here because the military situation is not decisive.'' Most of those commenting felt the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest element of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s three-party rebel coalition, would act first. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> have something to prove ... that they can not be eliminated in the political domain and that they are a permanent factor'' in any settlement, <PERSON> Godement </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. At the 19-nation conference, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> excluded a share of authority for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, contending his allies would be less dangerous in power than out, insisted they participate in a four-party transitional government that would run the country before elections. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s chief delegate, Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON>, said the failure to reach a settlement `` signifies that the resistance struggle against Vietnamese agression will continue in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would continue aid to the guerrillas while seeking peace. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said privately: `` We may be moving into a period where, having had this initial test of political opinion, things will go back to ... the battlefield.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration welcomed the progress made at the conference and hoped it would lead to a comprehensive settlement. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON>, Vietnamese ambassador in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s army was capable of defending itself. `` They are very self-confident and I think they are very capable,'' he said. At a news conference Wednesday night, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> called for a diplomatic solution but said he expected renewed attacks by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have really prepared ourselves for the worst,'' he told the reporters.

 A bridge being built over a major <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> artery collapsed during rush-hour Thursday as workers poured its concrete deck, trapping several motorists beneath debris. Fourteen people were injured. One victim, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elkridge </LOCATION>, was listed in critical condition. She was one of five commuters in two cars caught under a hail of wet concrete, metal and wood on the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 30, suffered multiple injuries, including head wounds and facial cuts, said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trohanis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. None of the other victims, including nine construction workers, had serious injuries, authorities said. Investigators were focusing on the false work, or shoring, that supports the concrete road surface while it cures and sets. The workers had poured about 200 tons of concrete and were two-thirds of the way through when the bridge collapsed in the middle, said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, deputy administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The shoring basically collapsed. We suspect the shoring is probably the cause of the failure. We have no specific conclusions at this point,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. `` The shoring was a combination of timber members and steel members,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. `` Conceivably _ I am not suggesting this at all _ something could have hit one of the support members and thereby led to the failure.'' Early morning rush-hour traffic was heavy when the Route 198 span collapsed about 6:30 a.m. `` All I seen was concrete flying and falling down,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` It collapsed fast.'' Rescue workers initially feared more cars may have been trapped under a 10-foot-tall pile of debris and carefully removed pieces of gooey concrete, wood and metal by hand. By 11 a.m., however, rescuers said it appeared all the victims had been rescued. Heavy equipment was brought in to clean up the debris. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said five federal inspectors were at the overpass at the time of the collapse. The supports for the molds into which the concrete was being poured had been inspected and approved in early July, he said. `` The foreman said he heard a clanging or a clunk just before the bridge collapsed, but there was really no warning,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said. The concrete-laden span lay in the parkway amid the broken and twisted metal and wood that once formed its framework. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said it will be two days before the parkway is reopened. One commuter, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Izzard </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, was treated for minor injuries at the shock trauma center and released, a hospital spokesman said. Three <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> men riding in the same car as <PERSON> Izzard </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, 29; <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 53 _ were listed in good condition with minor bruises at Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Nine construction workers were taken to <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Darci </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said eight were treated for sprains and bruises and discharged. The ninth suffered a fractured and dislocated shoulder.

 The director of the British Interest Section met at the Foreign Ministry Thursday with an Argentine diplomat in the first such meeting since the two nations went to war in 1982 and cut diplomatic ties. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> chief for Foreign Minister <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavallo </PERSON>. A similar meeting took place in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Argentina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> and a British Foreign Ministry official. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> seek to improve commercial and trade links en route to resuming full diplomatic relations.

Both nations claim the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and fought over them in 1982. Nearly 1,000 people were killed in the 74-day war, which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> won. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has refused to formally declare an end to hostilities and has barred British planes and ships from local ports, among other restrictions. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which has ruled the windswept islands as a colony since 1833, retook possession after an Argentine invasion and now is enforcing a 150-mile `` protection zone'' around them.

President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> broke the stalemate after taking office in July. He offered to set aside _ without prejudicing either claim _ the issue of who owns the islands in order to discuss other topics of mutual concern.

 Foreign dignitaries streamed into a freshly painted <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> on Thursday for celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the radical revolution led by Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. Friday's multimillion-dollar bash, featuring a military parade and air show, was expected to attract top officials from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The dispatching of high-ranking envoys from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the festival underlined <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s efforts in recent years to move away from a radical, go-it-alone policy to one of cooperation with his Northern African neighbors and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, it appeared not all of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s plans for the celebration would come off. A Western European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said committee sessions on a planned Maghreb summit had broken off over differences in financial matters between the <ORGANIZATION> Maghreb </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> seized power from King <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> on Sept. 1, 1969, and replaced the country's pro-Western policy with his own personal brand of socialism and pan-Arabism. Relations between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> deteriorated, and in April 1986 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bombed <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> in retaliation for what it called <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s sponsoring of international iterrorism On Thursday, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s military airport to greet the leaders of <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s presence was unusual. He rarely travels and is thought to have gone to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, an ally, because of his isolation in his war against <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christians. A military band played and 21-gun salutes boomed as the dignitaries were met by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, wearing white slacks, a white jacket, a green shirt and sunglasses. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> made the grandest entry, sailing into <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s downtown harbor in a small white ship flanked by Libyan escort vessels and blaring its horn. The leaders of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> already were in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, along with official delegations from other Arab, African and Asian countries. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would attend. Italian Foreign Ministrer <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> was the highest-ranking <PERSON> Westerner </PERSON> who traveled to the former Italian colony. He was the first Italian government official to visit <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since it fired a missile at an Italian island in 1986. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> sent a top-level envoy to the celebrations, in a cautious step toward resolving a bitter feud with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Waly </PERSON>, deputy prime minister and secretary-general of the ruling party, was the highest Egyptian official to visit since 1977, when the two countries fought a five-day border war. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> recently reopened their border and resumed air flights. Western European diplomats in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> said they expected the two countries would soon re-establish diplomatic relations, broken in 1978. In <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, diplomats announced that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> had signed a peace agreement. In the accord, signed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, the two countries agreed to end 16 years of fighting over the disputed Aozou strip and try to reach a political settlement within a year. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> was represented at the <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> festivities by a delegation led by Minister of State <PERSON> Jedenkar </PERSON> <PERSON> Donou </PERSON> <PERSON> Aukar </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, sirens blared as white-jacketed policemen on motorcycles escorted official motorcades to seaside hotels. The city was freshly painted white and green, the colors of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s flag, for the celebration. Brightly colored helium balloons about three feet in diameter floated from buildings, and a large green, yellow and white hot-air balloon emblazoned with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s picture rose from a parking lot near the central Green Square. Hundreds of green <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> flags fluttered from lampposts and windows, and strings of lights glowed above the streets. The celebrations to mark the annivesary begin Friday with a special meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s parliament The session will be followed by the air show and military parade.

 Thousands of people in the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> surged into the streets of its capital Thursday night to protest a legislative compromise that will keep the Russian language a part of their everyday life, activists said. Members of the southern republic's legislature voted to substitute Moldavian _ similar to <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> _ for <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> as the language of government and economic affairs. But they ruled that both Russian and Moldavian could be used in everyday life. `` The people are scandalized. We need only one language,'' said <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestase </PERSON> of the pro-Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the capital. Nestase estimated tens of thousands of people took to the streets outside the theater where the deputies had met, and he played a tape recording of the shouting masses. He said hundreds of police armed with clubs had formed a cordon around the building. `` If this decision is not reversed, we will start a general strike,'' he said. The next step, he said, is secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are not a legal part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said, pointing to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940 under the terms of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, which also put the Baltic states under Soviet control. The legislators had been seeking a compromise that would placate both Moldavian nationalists and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> immigrants. The Moldavians are trying to shed what they see as decades of infringement on their rights. The Russians feared they would be forced to learn Moldavian and went on strike at 200 enterprises in protest. Representatives of both the Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Russian group <PERSON> Yedinstvo </PERSON> said Wednesday they saw support for the compromise. The choice of language is an important issue for Soviets because many believe they were forced to adopt Russian even though their native tongues are vastly different and represent their distinct cultural heritage. The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, gave the nationalists a clear-cut victory in two of its three decisions Thursday. It declared Moldavian the state language, to be used in `` political, economic, social and cultural affairs.'' <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> previously had no official language, but <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> was typically used in government and commerce, especially since many cities are dominated by non-Moldavians. The legislature also restored the Latin alphabet taken away a half-century ago by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> when he annexed <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed Cyrillic _ the alphabet used in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> _ to back his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities even though the languages are virtually identical The vote approving the bill on Moldavian as the official language was 321-11, with an undetermined number of abstentions, said a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> ATEM </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s official news agency. There were conflicting reports on the vote counts on other measures. The third proposal, which was rejected, would have made Moldavian the language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the republic. Many non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but they share some knowledge of Russian as a result of Soviet schooling. Legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise of bilingualism, similar to that proposed Wednesday by <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Semen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON>, after a telephone conversation with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> According to a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> ATEM </ORGANIZATION>, it reads: `` The Russian language, as the language of inter-ethnic communication in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, is used on the territory of the republic together with Moldavian as a language of inter-ethnic communication, which ensures the carrying out of real bilingualism between <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and the national tongue.'' In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, the leaders of the People's Fronts of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> reacted to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership's recent scathing criticism of their independence movements with a lengthy analysis of the situation The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> report says recent petitions and demonstrations calling for freedom in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> `` are a normal process for today,'' said <PERSON> Ianis </PERSON> <PERSON> Krummins </PERSON>, deputy editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <LOCATION> Atmoda </LOCATION>. The Soviet press has been full of criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> since the party statement Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that some members of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met to discuss rising violence in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a largely Armenian territory inside <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> The group called for dialogue at all levels to stop ethnic clashes there.

 Soldiers killed one man and wounded six in a mistaken attack on a group of unarmed young people whose pickup truck ran out of gas after nighttime beach party, victims said Thursday. The man killed was <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, whose friends gave the party for him the night before he was to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said of the attack Tuesday and the killing of a high school student by a soldier last week: `` These are lamentable incidents that happen in the climate of tension in which we live.'' At least 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old civil war with leftist rebels. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday the soldiers involved in both shootings were in custody and would stand trial. `` The high command has no intention of covering up any criminal activity within the armed forces,'' he said. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, 23, spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his bed at <LOCATION> Rosales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. He was wounded in both arms and the abdomen during the encounter in the western province of Sonsonate. In the next bed, with a chest wound, was <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, 20. They said they were returning from the beach to their homes in <LOCATION> Sonsonate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with 13 companions at about 3:00 a.m. Tuesday and ran out of gas on a rural highway. `` We were waiting for dawn to see if someone would come by and take us to buy gas when two vehicles drove up and, without saying a word, they opened fire,'' <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said. `` After they shot us, they asked us where our guns were.'' A statement from Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, Sonsonate provincial commander, said his post was informed by a motorist that guerrillas had set up a roadblock on the highway. `` A patrol was dispatched and, when the patrol was driving along the highway, some individuals stepped out all of a sudden making signals to stop, and that is when the soldiers opened fire,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said the the soldiers `` acted wrongly. They could have pointed their guns at us, asked us who we were and checked our documents.'' He, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and another seriously wounded man were moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` The soldiers did not want to take us to the hospital, but after a while their hearts softened and they took us to the Sonsonate hospital,'' <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> said. `` Even so, their truck would n't start at first and they made us, even the wounded ones, push it to ... start it.'' On Aug. 22, high school student <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, 17, was killed by an army trooper who was checking the youngster's documents at a checkpoint in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` We have no doubts about the honesty and the good conduct of the student <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, who was not involved in any subversive activity,'' Col. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> said Tigrean rebels launched surprise attacks `` on all fronts'' in northeastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> at dawn Thursday _ six days after saying they wanted peace talks. The announcement came only hours after <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> had given an optimistic assessment of recent peace moves to the country's Shengo, or parliament. But when the legislative assembly resumed its afternoon session, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> reappeared to tell deputies of a dawn offensive by the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The president said the rebels launched massive attacks in Tigre and <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> provinces in northeastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and that fighting may have extended to <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION> in the northwest. He said the offensive appears to be supported by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s major rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are indications that the rebels might extend the fighting to <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION> and attempt to cut the Addis Ababa-Assab highway,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s main port on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the highway, which was badly damaged in a series of earthquakes 10 days ago, was reopened only Wednesday. It is the capital's main link to the sea. The two rebel groups supported each other in coordinated attacks in early 1988 that won them control of all of Tigre and most of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost province. <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> were largely spared in that offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> called Thursday's attack `` a regrettable and sad development.'' While he did not give casualty figures for either side, his description of the fighting suggested government forces are being pushed back. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> had told the morning's opening session of Parliament that his government soon would hold peace talks with the Tigrean rebels. Although he made no reference to those planned talks in his afternoon announcement, the attack may have put any possible negotiations on indefinite hold. Government officials and Eritrean rebels have planned to meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> beginning Sept. 7 with former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> acting as an observer. Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago to press for increased autonomy in their region. On Aug. 25, they announced they were ready for peace talks overseen by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1961. They agreed to peace talks in June after <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> announced there would be no conditions and he would welcome an independent observer.

 An 865-foot Singaporean tanker spilled at least 1,000 gallons of crude oil Thursday into the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> while discharging cargo at a refinery, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Preliminary reports indicate that human error may be responsible,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said about four hours after the tanker <PERSON> Minerva </PERSON>'s 11:20 a.m. at the British Petroleum Refinery. The cause remained under investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which initially reported the spill at 4,200 gallons, revised its figure after <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said the spill involved only 600 gallons.

Representatives of the Minerva, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Argo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, and the refinery immediately notified authorities and put containment booms around the tanker, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The ship hired a pollution contractor, which deployed a boat and trucks to vacuum up the crude. Petty Officer <PERSON> Jery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheddel </PERSON> said spills of less than 10,000 gallons are considered minor on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. On June 24, the Uruguayan tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> spilled an estimated 300,000 gallons of heating oil.

<TEXT>
 The director of forensic medicine in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said Thursday that many Palestinian deaths attributed to clashes with troops in the occupied areas actually resulted from criminal disputes or other circumstances. The comments by <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Abu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, came as an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tax collector died of injuries from a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> firebomb attack two weeks ago and a Palestinian, whose family said he was beaten, died of wounds in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Tax collector <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaken </PERSON>'s death raised to 39 the number of Israelis killed in the Palestinian rebellion. At least 554 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or Jewish settlers during the 20-month-old revolt, and 100 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators. At least 16 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he found 25 percent of deaths attributed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troopers during the uprising were not linked to the army. He said 30 percent of the Palestinians killed and said to be `` victims of the intefadeh,'' or uprising, were brought to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> for autopsies. In one fourth of the cases, <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> said he found the <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> died of strangulation, stabbing or suffocation and not army force. In two cases, the victims had been decapitated, he said. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> attributed the deaths to criminal disputes, family honor killings and suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I fear that in a number of years ... the world will blame us for causing the death of thousands of residents of the territories, many of whom I am certain did not die from army operations,'' <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> said. He said the deaths, including some from natural causes, `` are all put in one basket of victims of the intefadeh.'' The controversy over cause of death in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is reflected in differing death tolls offered by rival sides and by news organizations. Official army statistics show 450 Palestinians killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as a result of clashes with troops between December 1987 and mid-August 1989. An unofficial toll for the same period compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> showed 535 Palestinians killed by troops or settlers. Both tolls exclude many deaths which <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said resulted from tear-gas inhalation or beatings. Some Palestinian organizations put the number of Palestinian deaths at more than 700. One Palestinian journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the Arab figures exxagerated. He said hospital doctors were threatened and their cars burned for refusing to falsify death records. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> also noted the widespread practice of taking bodies from hospitals in Arab areas and burying them before an autopsy. He recommended exhuming the bodies for autopsies. <PERSON> Hiss </PERSON> said many claims of torture or killing by troops proved untrue when autopsy was performed. He cited the death of <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, 14, a Palestinian-American boy, near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> two weeks ago. Palestinian reports said the boy was found dead with broken arms, teeth knocked out and cigarette burns covering his body, but an autopsy at <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> and a subsequent independent autopsy found no signs of torture. <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> died from a gunshot in the back. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Zaken </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Hadassah hospital after suffering burns on 70 percent of his body in a firebomb attack. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, 19-year-old <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> of head injuries. His family said he was beaten by soldiers in a clash four days earlier. The army said it was investigating the reported beating. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the body of a 30-year-old Palestinian taxi driver, <PERSON> Burhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Badawi </PERSON>, was found in a pushcart in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. Arab reporters said the reason for his death was unclear.

<HEAD>Audit: Plug Loophole for Tax-Exempt Incone</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The overall premium charges for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic coverage would be lowered by plugging a loophole that favors senior citizens with tax-free investment income, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said Thursday. Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said in an audit report that if tax-exempt interest were included in the income calculation used to figure individual premiums, `` significant'' revenues could be generated to reduce premiums and correct an inequity that hurts less affluent beneficiaries. Auditors said they were unable to estimate how much could be produced by closing the loophole. `` We believe, however, that it is sizable,'' the audit said. `` Across the country, financial advisors are educating the public on how they can reduce their catastrophic coverage premium by shifting to tax-free or tax-deferred investments, such as municipal bonds, annuities and mutual funds.'' The inspector general said closing the loophole `` would produce savings that could be used, if the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were so inclined, to reduce premiums.'' The audit said the exclusion is unfair to lower income and financially unsophisticated taxpayers who do not own tax-free investments and have no opportunity to avoid paying the premium. The exclusion of tax-exempt interest also is inconsistent with the way the federal government taxes Social Security benefits. In figuring how much of these benefits can be taxed, Social Security recipients must include tax-exempt income. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in comments included in the audit, rejected the inspector general's recommendation that it propose legislation to close the loophole. The agency noted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said it is too early in the program to start making changes in it. The catastrophic coverage program was set up to be funded entirely by the elderly. Senior citizens who object to the supplemental premium they will pay have been pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change the funding mechanism. To pay for the program, the Medicare Part B premium this year was increased by $ 4 per month and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries will pay a supplemental premium computed at $ 22.50 per $ 150 of federal income tax liability. That premium is scheduled to increase to $ 42 by 1993. The most a person will have to pay this year is $ 800, or $ 1,600 for a couple in which both partners are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Four social workers were indicted on child abuse charges Thursday in the death of a 2-year-old boy who was released to his parents despite warnings that he was in danger. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> died of a brain hemorrhage at his home on July 28 after his mother and stepfather punished him for soiling his diapers by repeatedly dunking him `` plunger-like'' head-first into a commode, police said. `` I think we are seeing the beginning of accountability,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, who was <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s foster mother before he was returned to his parents. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> died two months later. Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> had warned caseworkers of the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of the possibility that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was being abused at his parents' <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> home. She called the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury action an `` indictment of the system which failed <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and other children like him.'' <PERSON> Caseworker </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was indicted on a third-degree felony charge of child abuse and a second-degree misdemeanor charge of failing to report child abuse. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s former supervisor, program administrator <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> and former caseworker <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Duboise </PERSON> each were indicted on charges of failing to report child abuse. On conviction, each count of child abuse could be punishable by five years in prison; failure to report child abuse could be punished by 60 days in jail. An earlier HRS investigation led to <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s suspension for six weeks on Aug. 15. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was demoted from supervisor to caseworker, <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> was reprimanded and <PERSON> DuBoise </PERSON> resigned rather than face action from her superiors. Regional administrator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McFayden </PERSON>, who was given a three-week suspension by HRS, was n't charged in the Thursday indictment. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, 20, have been indicted on first-degree murder charges. Their trial is scheduled to start Dec. 11. Mrs. <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> abandoned <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> shortly after his birth, turning him over to a stranger in a shopping mall. He wound up in a foster home, and his foster parents told social workers there were signs of his being abused on weekly home visits allowed with the Coes.

<TEXT>
 Several important manuscripts by French philosopher <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> and his companion, writer <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>, have been accepted as payment of estate taxes from de Beauvoir's heirs, officials announced Thursday. The texts include the manuscripts of <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON>'s work `` Flaubert: The Idiot of the Family,'' `` The Critique of Dialectical Reason'' and 399 letters <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON> wrote to de Beavoir between 1926 and 1963, some of which have never been published. Most exciting is the discovery of 255 letters from de Beauvoir to <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON>, which literary historians did not know existed. The two intellectuals met while university students and corresponded regularly during a relationship which ended with <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON>'s death in 1980. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beavoir </PERSON>, best known for her best-selling and influential feminist essay, `` The Second Sex,'' died in 1986. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s budget minister, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Charasse </PERSON>, made the announcement. All the texts taken as payment of estate taxes become the property of the government and part of the French national collections. The texts also include nine of Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvoir </PERSON>'s her private diaries, her unpublished `` Misunderstanding in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' `` Monologue'' and `` Old Age.'' Among works by <PERSON> Sartre </PERSON>, a leading proponent of existentialism, are: the novel `` Nausea,'' the plays `` No Exit'' and `` The Flies'' and the treatise `` Being and Nothingness.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said she never imagined her husband <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> would break down emotionally but `` a person's mental capacity ... can only take so much.'' The tearful wife of the television evangelist spoke to reporters outside her home here after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was committed to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, who suspended his fraud trial in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` We have been under emotional stress for 2 -LCB- years and we've been holding steady for 2 -LCB- years and I just think that he could n't hold steady anymore, and I would like to tell the people you be in our shoes and see if you could hold steady for 2 -LCB- years,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. A sobbing <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was led away in handcuffs and manacles Thursday after a psychiatrist reported that he had been hallucinating and cowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office. The same day, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> prayed in a television broadcast of her `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' for the `` spirit of lying'' to be driven out of her husband's fraud trial, but she did not mention the incident. `` Spirit of lying you are bound!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> prayed on the broadcast from an <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> studio Thursday. `` Get out of that courtroom, get off God's people in the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> also issued a message to her husband that she and others were in prayer for him. `` I love you darling, hang in there, do n't give up,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` And that's all you have to do. You do n't even have to do the praying. Let us do the praying. Let the people who love you do the praying.'' Asked by reporters later whether she thought in her `` worst fears'' her husband might suffer a mental breakdown, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> replied, `` No, I did n't. But you know, a person's mental capacity, I suppose, can only take so much.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said her husband was very distressed by the collapse in the courtroom Wednesday of former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a prosecution witness. `` I knew when I talked to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> last night that he was in a terrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed that we would trust the Lord,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A seven-pronged, $ 191 million research program to understand how man's activities and pollution are changing the planet was laid out Thursday by a group of federal agencies. The goal is `` to monitor, understand and, ultimately, predict global change,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON> of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. `` Global change is a large, complex scientific problem and it still is not largely understood,'' said <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating the research effort. `` There is a shared, common purpose; to understand global change. We're in the planning stages,'' added <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The effort announced Thursday covers the coming fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> described it as largely a planning period to be used setting up research programs likely to last a decade or more. The atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority in in the program. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said clouds are a major factor in the feared rise in global temperatures, and their effect is not well understood. The widely discussed threat of global warming, however, is only part of the overall research effort. The studies also will look at threats to the earth's protective ozone layer, possible changes in the oceans and atmosphere, air pollution, acid rain and other processes. Reports of warmer temperatures have drawn the most attention recently. Some scientists are concerned that carbon dioxide and other gases added to the atmosphere by human activities are causing the higher temperatures and tha eventually they might lead to disruptive climate changes. Other scientists dispute the so-called greenhouse effect, and evidence is lacking on both sides. That is an area the researchers hope to tackle early. Funds totaling $ 191.5 million for fiscal 1990 are included in the budgets of various departments to get the program under way, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. In January the committee will put together requests for funds for 1991 and future years, he said. The seven major areas of research set forth Thursday are: _ Climate and hydrologic systems The role of clouds is the first item on the agenda, followed by research in ocean circulation, and interaction of the air land and water. _ Biogeochemical dynamics: the relationship between living organisms and the water and atmosphere For example, trees take carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen. Cutting down trees reduces that activity. _ Ecological systems and dynamics: how people, plants and animals would react to climate change and how those reactions might in turn affect other processes _ Earth system history: what has happened to the land, air and water when climate has changed in the past _ Human interactions: population growth and development, energy and land use and industrial production and how those activities affect the earth _ Solid earth research: coastal erosion, volcanoes and their effect on climate, permafrost, the seafloor and other areas _ Solar influences: monitoring incoming radiation from the sun, the amount reflected back into space and how this energy affects the earth and its climate In addition to the Geological Survey, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>, other agencies in the program are the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Council on Environmental Quality and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday suspended the adoptions of babies by foreigners after President <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> complained the system was run more like a business than a social service. Court President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said adoptions in process may be completed. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> complained publicly on Aug. 17 that `` infants are being sold for $ 7,000 and incredibly, judges and lawyers are involved in this business. ... It is a shame that Paraguayan children are negotiated over like merchandise.'' The general ousted the 34-year regime of President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup and was overwhelmingly elected president on May 1. Newspapers printed stories involving poor women who said they felt pressured to give up their children, and of foreigners, many from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, allegedly paying large sums for healthy babies with blond hair and blue eyes. Judges became reluctant to give the final authorization that would allow Paraguayan infants to leave the country with adoptive parents. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhof </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, are among eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> couples in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> awaiting judicial permission to take home babies they were given since arriving during the previous two weeks. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> has put on 1 -LCB- pounds since we got him,'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhof </PERSON>, a 36-year-old computer software salesman, said in a telephone interview. `` They asked us what color we wanted,'' he said, noting that the baby has `` dark hair, dark eyes and medium to dark skin ... We did n't care. We were more concerned that it be a boy. We have a daughter.'' Until recently, adoptions by foreign families were comparatively easy and fast. Adoptions by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> families went from 37 in 1985 to 322 in 1988. `` I called several adoption agencies in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, but when they found out our ages, they would n't accept us,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, 37, in an interview earlier this year. She and her husband, <PERSON> Granville </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hanceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, now are the parents of 6-month-old <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a chubby, black-haired boy with brown eyes. About 220 adoptions are pending, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
 A congressman opposed to aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Contras contended Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> admits it lacks the intelligence capability to assure that rebel attacks on civilians in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had ceased. `` The adminstration admits now that they knew that they could n't keep their promise to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said in a news release that quoted a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> letter to him <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> was referring to the agreement under which the Contras could receive non-military aid if they refrained from offensive actions. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, however, said its letter was misinterpreted. The letter from <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, said: `` We do not have a strong intelligence capability to assess responsibility for the initiation of the reported clashes which mar the informal truce in effect between the Nicaraguan Resistance and Sandinista forces. `` But given that the Resistance has been cut off from military aid and is very low on ammunition, we do not believe that they have the ability to take an offensive mode.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the department has asserted to the Contras its position against military attacks. `` In one case, we terminated family support to a commander whose unit initiated an offensive operation after the bipartisan accord,'' she said. She also said `` we may have prevented an offensive operation'' in another instance, by contacting the Contra command after learning a unit leader may have been planning an attack. The letter was a response to one written by <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> and signed by 83 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asking the administration to investigate allegations that the Contras were `` engaged in offensive military actions.'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>'s letter listed nine alleged Contra attacks between April 13 and June 8, reported by Witness for Peace, a human rights organization. The congressman said the reports have been corroborated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalists. `` The administration is turning a blind eye to a series of well-documented human rights abuses and military actions by Contra forces,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>' response did not speak directly to the Witness for Peace list, but alluded to another series of alleged Contra attacks reported by the Nicaraguan government which, she said, were investigated by an agency. She did not identify the agency but said that it could verify only a small number as having taken place. On the other hand, she said: `` The Department has received an increasing number of worrisome reports of Sandinista abuses from Nicaraguan and international human rights organizations.'' Under the bipartisan agreement that accompanied the $ 48 million Contra aid package approved last April, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to cut off funds to all <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> units that persisted in offensive actions such as killing or kidnaping civilians. Under the informal agreement, which has no legal standing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not continue spending the $ 48 million on the Contras after Nov. 30 if congressional leaders found that the Contras were not acting in good faith toward peace in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The money was appropriated for use through Feb. 28, 1990.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was committed to a mental institution in handcuffs and leg shackles Thursday after a psychiatrist reported the TV evangelist was hallucinating and cowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> suspended <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial and ordered him to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION> for up to 60 days for psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. `` Please do n't do this to me,'' a sobbing, disheveled <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said as he was led from his lawyer's office by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals to the courthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in a fetal position in the back seat. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please,'' a deputy marshal said. After the paperwork was completed, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, bound hand and foot, was taken to <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION> to spend his first night behind bars since the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> scandal broke. The evangelist is accused of fleecing followers of his evangelical empire. He was lying in the back seat of a marshal's car when he arrived, and a marshal held him on each side as he walked in a slow, stooped shuffle into the prison. Dr. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who has been treating <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for nine months, told the judge that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> began hallucinating Wednesday after a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive testifying against him collapsed on the stand. The witness was revived within seconds and said he was laid low by illness. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> reported that when he left the courthouse Wednesday, suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animals which he felt were intent on destroying him, attacking him and hurting him,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s condition worsened overnight, even after he was given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was not in court for the hearing. On Thursday morning, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> `` was lying in the corner of his attorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt him.'' `` To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said later. Prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. But during the hearing, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> described the psychiatrist as a `` hired gun.'' Former Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said most pretrial psychiatric evaluations take about 45 days. But the judge told jurors _ who were not told the reason for the suspension in the trial _ to report back to court in a week. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives are accused of diverting for their own use more than $ 4 million of $ 158 million raised from followers who gave $ 1,000 for three nights' free lodging each year for life at the ministry's hotels. If convicted on all 24 counts, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $ 5 million. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, told reporters her husband was very distressed by the collapse in the courtroom Wednesday of former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a prosecution witness. `` I knew when I talked to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> last night that he was in a terrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed that we would trust the Lord,'' she said outside her home in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I would like to tell the people, you be in our shoes and see if you can hold steady for 2 -LCB- years,'' she added. Defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, kept saying he wanted the trial to continue but was `` on the floor in a fetal position.'' `` If Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is handled gently and carefully he may be able to proceed with this trial,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The defense had tried to persuade the judge to allow <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to stay in a private institution. Last year, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> described a similar scene, saying in a fund-raising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in a fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry in 1987. And <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s downfall, said in a 1987 Playboy interview that just after the tryst, a fellow evangelist who had just come from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s hotel room said he was `` lying in a fetal position in his room, saying he's happy.'' `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s biggest power play was and still is manipulation through sympathy,'' Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said through her publicist, <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundin </PERSON>, after hearing of Thursday's incident. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his initial diagnosis was that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was `` actively hallucinating,'' suffers from `` acute depression'' and has episodes where he is unable `` to adequately judge and relate to reality.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s collapse came the same day that lawyers confirmed that another key witness in the trial, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> second-in-command <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, was being treated at a <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hospital for an undisclosed ailment. The Butner facility has been used for psychiatric evaluations of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who shot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>. It houses about 320 inmates, including about 150 in the mental health unit. <PERSON> Marshals </PERSON> said the shackles that bound <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> are standard procedure for moving prisoners. A few supporters were on hand to offer encouragement. `` He will come back,'' said <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s a fighter. He's not a quitter ... but it will take time.''

 Buses, beaches and public swimming pools are segregated by law throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but a judge ruled Thursday that a town council was wrong in reserving a park for whites. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Supreme Court Judge C.F. <PERSON> Eloff </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Carletonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> acted with `` improper motives'' when it resegregated the park last year. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the South African Council of Churches said authorities in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> are refusing to investigate charges that West German firms are helping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> build submarines in violation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arms embargo. Also Thursday, publishers of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest-selling newspaper were fined $ 800 for violating a security law by quoting a banned black activist. The Sunday Times published an interview with <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, in December after his release from prison. Lawyers said they will appeal the judgment from a magistrate who said the newspaper was negligent in failing to determine that <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> is among people not allowed to quoted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, town council chairman <PERSON> Jacobus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nel </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that officials banned blacks from the park because of complaints they were littering and urinating in public. However, <PERSON> Eloff </PERSON> said: `` I find that the town council was not motivated to make the decision on account of a nuisance of black people.'' Three <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> businessmen filed the suit, saying the resegregation triggered a black consumer boycott. The town 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> is one of several where the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has reinstituted strict segregation since capturing control in municipal elections last year. The Conservatives oppose all concessions to the 28-million black majority and say blacks should have political rights only in tribal homelands. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policy of race discrimination, it is legal to segregate public facilities, though many public places have been integrated in recent years. Conservative party spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Thursday's ruling will be appealed because the council acted `` strictly within statute law.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s position is `` vicious hypocrisy.'' The Nationalists like to boast to foreign audiences that they are dismantling apartheid, while maintaining segregation to please white voters, he said. The South African Council of Churches said in a statement that reports by an Oslo-based monitoring group and <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WDR </ORGANIZATION> television provided details of three West German companies collaborating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s submarine project. `` Throughout the submarine saga, the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government has sought to sweep the matter under the carpet,'' the church council said. It noted the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government on Aug. 1 refused a request by the <LOCATION> Kiel </LOCATION> prosecutor's office to investigate the Kiel ship-building company <ORGANIZATION> Howaldtswerke-Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Werft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and the engineering firm <LOCATION> Ingenieurkontor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luebeck </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said there was no evidence the firms' dealings with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were illegal. `` The government can only be cleared if it allows an intensive investigation,'' the council said. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Dries </PERSON> <PERSON> Putter </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Thursday that the navy has `` postponed indefinitely'' plans to build its own submarines. He said the navy has completed a major modernization of one of its three French-built, <PERSON> Daphne </PERSON> class submarines and is busy upgrading a second. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> customarily refuses to disclose details of military cooperation with foreign countries.

<HEAD>Former Premier Resigns As Party President, Then Changes His Mind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> resigned Thursday as president of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then changed his mind several hours later. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> told a meeting of party leaders late Thursday that he would stay on as Christian Democrat president after receiving assurances that his opinions would be respected. Only hours earlier, he told reporters he had resigned because of concerns the party `` gives the impression of being in a different frequency than mine.'' The decision to stay on appeared to represent a gain for <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, considered on the `` left'' of the party. Its members had been criticized and excluded from top government posts since <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> as premier in July. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>'s faction of the party is considered more traditional and closer to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The support <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> received in party leaders' speeches Thursday also patched over a growing breach in the party, which has been the most important force in Italian government since World War II. `` <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> has responded in a convincing way,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said Thursday evening, referring to the premier's public plea to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> to remain in his post. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, 61, is credited with reversing the sliding electoral fortunes of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant party during his seven-year term as party secretary, which ended in February. He was then moved to party president, a position with less authority, post, because of charges by party members that he held too much power. The move led to the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s 13-month-old government in May. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> then formed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 49th postwar government with the party's same five coalition partners: <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists, Social Democrats, Liberals and Republicans. Political observers had speculated that a <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> resignation could lead to a split in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Such a division would radically change the political landscape in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been the main force keeping the Communists out of power.

 Soviet lawmakers here observing the workings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said Thursday they want the same authority that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has in order to curb the power of executive government officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, many good ideas'' for Soviet democracy such as legislative oversight over the military and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police still lack support to become law, said <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON>, leader of the six-member delegation of the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on constitutionality and legislative reform, said many Old Guard deputies in his country's legislative body refuse to even vote on such proposals. `` When the question of roll call arises, two-thirds of the deputies oppose letting the voters know how they voted, and until today the proposal is blocked,'' said another Supreme Soviet member, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebentsov </PERSON>. The delegation is studying the adoption of time-saving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic voting systems `` that will make it possible for every voter to know how his deputy voted,'' <PERSON> Sebentsov </PERSON> said. `` This may be hard for some deputies to get used to, but they're going to have to.'' Addressing a news conference here, the Soviet lawmakers said they are determined to convert their country to a genuine democracy despite entrenched resistence and potentials for setbacks. `` People in all groups of society favor moving toward greater democracy _ farmers, intellectuals, the working class, young people, the middle-aged _ and this is a very powerful force,'' <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON> said. `` ... We are building from the ground level, like bricklayers ... without a good blueprint, but with great desire to build a good house,'' he said. `` To draw the blueprint we have come to study the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> model, and not only the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> but also -LRB- European -RRB- continental parliaments.'' The Soviet lawmakers' three-week visit is being sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, an independent non-partisan educational group, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic organization.

The armed forces said in a statement that the land, air and naval maneuvers would take place in <LOCATION> Cortes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> provinces, northwest of the capital. The statement said the maneuvers were designed to prepare `` to repel a hypothetical subversive action.'' The maneuvers will help commanders evaluate the defensive capacity of the Honduran military, the statement added. It said that medical and dental teams from both countries would provide health care in conjunction with the maneuvers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have staged about 80 joint maneuvers involving more than 100,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers since signing a joint defense treaty in 1954.

<HEAD>Pomak Leader Says Bulgarians Killing Hundreds; U.N. Team Visiting
Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leader of ethnic Turkish immigrants from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> claimed Thursday that 160 people have been killed in clashes this month between Bulgarian security forces and the Moslem Pomak minority. <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavus </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and Solidarity of Balkan Turks, told a news conference hundreds of <LOCATION> Pomaks </LOCATION> have been killed in fighting in northern and southern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and thousands have been imprisoned. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it has sent a team to investigate charges that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has expelled more than 250,000 members of its Turkish minority in the past three months. The team will visit <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cavus </PERSON> said his reports on alleged killings came from sources in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. He declined to identify them further, saying he did not want to endanger them. Last week, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> denied a report quoting diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> as saying 15 people had been killed in fighting between security forces and <LOCATION> Pomaks </LOCATION> _ a Bulgarian Moslem ethnic group numbering about 200,000. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Polansky </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to protest the alleged human rights abuses. <PERSON> Cavus </PERSON> said the latest violence occurred after <PERSON> Pomaks </PERSON> held rallies to protest the government's refusal to give them passports to emigrate. The Pomaks had hoped to follow at least 310,000 ethnics Turks living in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> who have received passports and crossed to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since May, when communist authorities said at least nine ethnic <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> died in clashes with security forces in northern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Diplomats put the number of deaths in May at 30 or more. Like the Pomaks, the ethnic Turks say they were victims of a forced assimilation campaign. The sudden emigration has left <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> facing an acute labor shortage. Last month, special regulations empowered authorities to draft labor from towns to harvest the fields. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> also is affected by the exodus _ <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest refugee problem since the end of World War II _ and two weeks said it was closing its border to stem the flow. Early in August, 92 Pomaks from northern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> signed a statement protesting that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had refused to give them travel documents. They reportedly were told they are not included in reforms allowing all Bulgarians to travel abroad. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has been in touch with leaders of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` He did send a team headed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonah </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and the Collection of Information, to go to the area to ascertain the facts and report back to him,'' she said. <PERSON> Jonah </PERSON> is an assistant secretary-general whose office sometimes is called `` the secretary-general's foreign ministry.'' It was formed in 1987 and collects information on situations that could threaten peace and security. For five years, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has been trying to assimilate its 1 million ethnic Turks by denying their identity as a minority and forcing them to give up Islamic names. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s population is about 9 million.

 The suspected gunman in the slaying of a black teen-ager by a gang of whites surrendered upstate Thursday after an eight-day manhunt and returned to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where protesters marched with coffins and clashed with police. `` My name is <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is looking for me for murder,'' the 18-year-old was quoted as telling a police officer about 2:30 a.m. in <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A crowd estimated by police at 7,500, chanting `` No more!'' and `` Whose street? Our street!,'' marched through downtown <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> during Thursday evening's rush hour. Organizers said the march was prompted by the Aug. 23 killing of 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who was buried Wednesday. `` This is for the folks who could n't take off from work yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Jitu </PERSON> <PERSON> Weusi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Marchers carried two coffins, symbolizing those of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and of <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, the former Black Panther leader killed in an apparent drug dispute in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The march was peaceful until it reached barricades police set up to keep the protesters off the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. The marchers ran through the barricades, shouting `` take the bridge, take the bridge!'' A shoving match ensued with police at the bridge entrance. Police beat several marchers with nightsticks, and protesters threw bottles at officers. Several thousand of the marchers poured onto the bridge and blocked traffic. At least 23 police officers were injured, one requiring 20 stitches to the head, police said. There was no immediate report of injuries to civilians. Police defused the demonstration at 7:30 p.m. by agreeing to release one of the protest leaders in exchange for the march breaking up, said Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Police closed the bridge to traffic in both directions for about two hours, reopening it around 8:30 p.m. `` This was an absolute success!'' <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, a black community leader, proclaimed. `` This will make the city wake up. This will let the city know that there are young black people who will not take this any more.'' Earlier Thursday, when <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> surrendered, he asked for a lawyer and refused to answer questions, police Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to face a lineup and possible murder charges, authorities said. `` He was running like hell, scared to death, and knew we were breathing on his heels,'' said Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Six other suspects have been charged in the attack and are out on bail. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was shot and killed after being ambushed by a gang of up to 30 white youths carrying bats and golf clubs. He had arrived in the mostly white neighborhood with three black friends to answer a used-car ad. Police said the gang mistook the blacks for friends of a white teen-ager whose friendships with blacks had raised tension in the neighborhood. The slaying has prompted calls for justice from such figures as the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose film `` Do the Right Thing'' is about racial violence in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> told police he was tired of running after hitchhiking from the city, said <LOCATION> Oneonta </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donadio </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the Afghan resistance promised Thursday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will keep faith with a fragile rebel government torn by internal feuding. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> told a news conference the fractious guerrilla `` interim government'' remained the strongest symbol of the 11-year-old insurgency movement. He conceded, however, that the internecine fighting within the guerrilla alliance is `` discouraging.'' The two most powerful rebel groups _ <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> _ are fighting with each other in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>'s charismatic leader, <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, suspended his role in the rebel government to protest its failure to hold elections. He is foreign minister of that government. <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, an Islamic scholar and president of the guerrilla interim government, labeled <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> a `` killer.'' He said publicly that the vociferously anti-American <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> has used U.S.-supplied weapons to kill other guerrillas and other Afghans, a charge <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> denied. On July 9, <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>'s group was charged with killing 32 <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebels. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> backs the anti-communist rebels trying to oust <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s ruling Marxist government led by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has swamped its Afghan communist allies with military hardware, including medium-range Scud missiles, since pulling the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> out of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation Feb. 15. After nine years of military intervention the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> withdrew more than 110,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in line with a U.N.-brokered accord. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said since the Soviet troop withdrawal, more than 2,000 Soviet flights loaded with supplies have landed at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport. He said 300 Soviet military advisers remain in the Afghan capital. <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said the advisers have orchestrated hundreds of Scud missile firings and that some missiles hit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Scud has a range of up to 170 miles. Soviet personnel are also working in key Afghan government ministries, said <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON>. He blamed the continued fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will support a political settlement that removes <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from power. Millions of dollars in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and humanitarian help have gone to the Afghan guerrillas through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which also harbors more than 3 million war refugees. Gradually, however, the guerrilla government has been given direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid until now <PERSON> Tomsen </PERSON> said almost 50 percent of all humanitarian and military help goes directly to it.

<HEAD>Former Head Of Bankrupt Mine Arraigned For Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former director of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest copper mine was arraigned Thursday on charges of defrauding the bankrupt state company. Thirty-three company officials have been arrested. Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenal </PERSON>'s actions did not involve the administrative council of the <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> mine and that his office will not investigate the full council. `` All of the illegal actions that were taken were without the consent and without the knowledge of the administrative council. They were personal actions of the implicated party, and he confessed that,'' he told a news conference on Thursday. <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> is accused of embezzling $ 3 million. He is the son-in-law of former President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, who served from 1970-76. The miners' union had demanded an investigation of the Chilean-born <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> and other top management. Opposition political parties also alleged company mismanagement was involved and asked for an investigation after soldiers forced the open-pit mine to close down on Aug. 20. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said the bankruptcy was not due solely to mismanagement. `` The bad administration and conspiracy that occurred obviously caused damage. That is one of the reasons,'' he said. His office said in a statement earlier that <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> admitted `` to illegally authorizing contracts to obtain personal benefit of 5 percent of authorized sales'' from 1983-89. Closing of the mine, 25 miles south of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border, threw 3,200 miners out of work. It came one week before the mineworkers had scheduled a strike to press for a 330 percent wage-and-benefit increase. The government, which owns 90 percent of the operation, is seeking a buyer for the insolvent mine.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Twenty-five leftist groups Thursday formed `` a common front against repression'' by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s government, which they accused of unwarranted arrests and torturing of political opponents. `` Death-squads, often comprising soldiers, operate with complete impunity,'' said <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON>, co-leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference of 25 organizations, including <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s largest trade union, <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON> charged the government has been responsible for at least 60 human rights violations since June He did not list specific cases. `` In the last two months, the government has arrested without warrant and tortured dozens of people,'' he said.

They said they are forming a `` common front against repression.'' Since April, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> has been plagued by a crime wave including an average of one murder a day.

 The Rolling Stones opened their first concert tour in eight years with fireworks and <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s trademark strut as 50,000 fans jumped to their feet and began a night of dancing at their seats. The Stones, launching their 29-city `` Steel Wheels'' tour with concerts at Veterans Stadium Thursday and Friday, played on a stage 110 feet high and 300 feet wide showing a scene of industrial decay with catwalks, gray girders and black nets. `` Strong, tough, urban, risky,'' is how set-designer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who previously designed the stage for <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>'s `` The Wall'' tour, described the set, which includes more than 100 lights and three video screens. The Stones opened with `` Start Me Up'' from 1981, followed with `` Bitch'' from 1971 and `` Shattered'' from 1978. They then left the stage briefly, explaining they had lost power. After they returned, they were joined by three backup singers and four horn players. The flamboyant <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> strutted around the stage singing in his raunchy style while wearing his black leather pants and a kelly green tuxedo jacket. The crowd, which saw the band Living Colour as the opening act, ranged from young to old _ some even as old as the Stones themselves. `` They transcend age groups,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scespie </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>. `` I think they're one of the super-bands still left.'' `` They seem to change with the times or stay ahead of the times,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinnler </PERSON>, a 25-year-old resident of nearby <LOCATION> Doylestown </LOCATION>. She called the band `` the greatest in the world.'' The stage was unveiled just hours before Thursday night's opening show of the tour. About 250 people are needed to handle all of the equipment. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, production manager, called the stage a `` stirring indictment of contemporary society.'' Concertgoers paid $ 28.50 apiece for tickets, which sold out in two hours, 45 minutes. Scalpers were getting as much as $ 200 a ticket. The group opened its last tour, in 1981, in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as well. The `` Steel Wheels'' album has received generally favorable reviews. Some critics have called it the group's best work since 1978's `` Some Girls.'' <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, guitarists <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, and drummer <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> recorded the group's 34th album in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> earlier this year after <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the leaders of British band, resolved their feud over <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s desire to record and tour separately. The next stops on the 29-city North American tour are Sept. 3-4 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and Sept. 6 in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was supposed to have the opening of the tour on Friday night but lost out to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> after Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> ordered the closing of the aging <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, where the Stones were scheduled to play Sept. 21, for safety reasons. This was the only week the Stones could get Veterans Stadium. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the group's first recording, and some have speculated that `` Steel Wheels'' may be the Stones' last tour.

 Soviet lawmakers here observing the workings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said Thursday they want the same authority that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has in order to curb the power of executive government officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, many good ideas'' for Soviet democracy such as legislative oversight over the military and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police still lack support to become law, said <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON>, leader of the six-member delegation of the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet's committee on constitutionality and legislative reform, said many Old Guard deputies in his country's legislative body refuse to even vote on such proposals. `` When the question of roll call arises, two-thirds of the deputies oppose letting the voters know how they voted, and until today the proposal is blocked,'' said another Supreme Soviet member, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebentsov </PERSON>. The delegation is studying the adoption of time-saving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic voting systems `` that will make it possible for every voter to know how his deputy voted,'' <PERSON> Sebentsov </PERSON> said. `` This may be hard for some deputies to get used to, but they're going to have to.'' Addressing a news conference here, the Soviet lawmakers said they are determined to convert their country to a genuine democracy despite entrenched resistence and potentials for setbacks. `` People in all groups of society favor moving toward greater democracy _ farmers, intellectuals, the working class, young people, the middle-aged _ and this is a very powerful force,'' <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON> said. `` ... We are building from the ground level, like bricklayers ... without a good blueprint, but with great desire to build a good house,'' he said. `` To draw the blueprint we have come to study the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> model, and not only the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> but also -LRB- European -RRB- continental parliaments.'' The Soviet lawmakers' three-week visit is being sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, an independent non-partisan educational group, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a philanthropic organization.

<TEXT>
 The fourth hurricane of the season formed Thursday in the eastern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> with forecasters predicting gradual strengthening, and a tropical storm also churned across open water with winds remaining steady. Hurricane Gabrielle, which intensified as it pushed away from the African coast, had maximum sustained winds of about 75 mph with higher gusts in squalls, said forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurrican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> was centered near 11.4 north latitude and 32.0 west longitude, or about 540 miles southwest of <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verdes </LOCATION>, moving west at 17 mph. Forecasters expected <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> would slow down as it increases in strength by Friday. There is no danger <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> hitting land for several days, said forecasters. Tropical Storm Felix, meanwhile, maintained winds of 40 mph to keep it just above official storm status. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> was near 30.8 north latitude and 40.8 west longitude, or about 785 miles southwest of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> moving to the west northwest at 17 mph. A turn to the north is expected Friday or Saturday with little change in strength. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when sustained winds hit 74 mph. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

 Nine Latin American countries holding a drug-enforcement conference on Thursday praised <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for its battle against narcotics traffickers. `` The meeting expresses its profound appreciation to the people and government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for the resolute and vigorous way in which they are combating drug trafficking in their country,'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> told the closing session. He is assistant attorney general and heads <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s narcotics program. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> imposed curfews in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and eight nearby towns on Wednesday in its strong crackdown on the narcotics trade. Drug traffickers have waged a 2-week-old wave of assassinations, arson and bombings. Representatives of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> signed a letter of praise to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at the end of a three-day meeting. They gathered to prepare the agenda for the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, to be held in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in April 1990. Mexican Attorney General <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> violence will not be repeated in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was more likely to experience drug violence. `` We're strong, and we want to fight -LRB- drug trafficking -RRB-, and we will,'' he said, adding that `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has very good prospects'' for controlling drug trafficking, but the problem must be confronted with international coordination. Delegates agreed on 20 resolutions, among them the `` need to unite efforts in a common front as an effective instrument in the fight against drug trafficking.'' They said drug production, trafficking and addiction are crimes that affect humanity in general `` and should be deemed an affair of state and of national security,'' <PERSON> Coello </PERSON> <PERSON> Trejo </PERSON> reported. The meeting adopted a resolution recommending that drug laws be modernized and enforced, with stiffer penalties. It also advocated raising salaries of personnel in the drug fight. The attorney general said `` all of society'' must be involved in the struggle. Delegates agreed to meet again in January in <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ordered dependents of its embassy staff to leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, and authorities imposed a curfew on the nation's cocaine heartland in a bid to stop violence by drug lords. `` Everything has started with no major inconveniencies. People rushed to their homes shortly before the curfew time began and now the city is quiet,'' a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone Wednesday night. The 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was imposed on <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, home of the world's most powerful cocaine cartel, and surrounding communities to discourage bombings and other attacks by drug barons stung by the toughest anti-narcotics offensive ever launched in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. A police force of 4,000 was on full alert and 18 special anti-terrorist units were stationed throughout <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>.

 Credit card disclosure rules taking effect today offer the nation's 107 million card holders a new opportunity to shop around for lower interest rates, consumer activists say. Industry analysts, however, say they expect the new rules to have little impact _ at least over the short haul. The regulations, adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in April, require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate, monthly fee, grace period and other terms in a chart on applications used to sign up customers. Previously, the card's costs did not have to be disclosed until it arrived in the mail.

 Two plays that flopped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are delighting critics and audiences at the <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fringe </ORGANIZATION>, vindicating the faith of a producer with a fondness for `` problem plays.'' To be sure, the 422 plays on offer in the 43rd annual Festival Fringe include the usual number of American classics and Broadway hits, from `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' to more recent works including `` Agnes of God'' and `` Night, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON>.'' But two plays that were original also-rans are unexpectedly coming up trumps: <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>'s `` The Man Who Had Three Arms'' and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristofer </PERSON>'s `` The Lady and the Clarinet.'' Both plays, which were <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> flops in the early 1980s, have won The Scotsman newspaper's coveted Fringe First awards, given weekly to the best of the Fringe's many openings during the Festival's three weeks. `` <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> is a place where people feel able to see stuff over again, to make a re-evaluation,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, the New York-based producer of `` Lady and the Clarinet.'' The play, about the amorous foibles of a woman named <PERSON> Luba </PERSON>, starred <PERSON> Stockard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> in its off-Broadway production in 1983. This time, with British actress <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON> as <PERSON> Luba </PERSON>, the play is selling out at the 72-seat Netherbow Center playhouse. On Sept. 12, it transfers to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s King's Head Theater for a month, with a further transfer to the commercial West End likely to follow. `` It's not <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>; it's not great social drama. -LRB- But -RRB- it is more than just a funny play,'' said <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, who believes the play was undervalued in its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debut. `` I was surprised it had n't fared better there. <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> has been at the Fringe for eight years as executive producer of the American Festival Theater, a producing organization devoted to a cross-section of American plays. `` I've always liked to take on problem plays _ plays that have n't had whatever reception you think they should have had,'' he said Critics in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> have reaffirmed his faith in <PERSON> Cristofer </PERSON>, who is at work on the screenplay of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>'s novel `` Bonfire of the Vanities.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> in The Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> called `` Lady'' a `` spick-and-span little play, brilliantly acted by everyone.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coveney </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> thought it `` zippy,'' and said <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON> was `` wonderful.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, director of the Southside International production of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Albee </PERSON>'s `` Man Who Had Three Arms,'' similarly refused to be swayed by her play's previous fate. `` I think this is an exciting, really wonderful play,'' said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, a professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Albright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. She described her contribution as `` getting the play out of the drawer,'' following its frosty Broadway reception in 1983 <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> first mounted the three-character play at an Albee Festival last November and decided then to bring it to <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. The author is best known for `` Who's Afraid of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Woolf?'' and `` The Zoo Story,'' plays of the 1960s that are also being revived at this year's Fringe. Critic <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Affleck </PERSON>, writing in The Scotsman, called `` Man'' a remarkable play, and the same newspaper quoted <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> in a long-distance interview as saying he was ecstatic with its local reception in light of his `` long war with the drama critics of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said her staging was probably more `` audience-friendly'' than the strident, haranguing production so coolly received in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ a production she did not see. `` The original production was a little more hostile to the audience, and the critics were lying in wait for him -LRB- <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> -RRB-,'' she said. The play is structured around a lecture given by a man who mysteriously grows a third arm one day and then watches it shrink. `` What <PERSON> Albee </PERSON> does is make us question our own value system,'' said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>. `` I think the play is brilliant.'' Not every unsung American play has its reputation restored in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s `` The Wake of <PERSON> Jamey </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>,'' a short-lived Broadway entry early this decade, got mixed-to-poor reviews at this year's Fringe, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabe </PERSON>'s `` Hurlyburly,'' a Broadway success, was denounced in The Scotsman as `` exploitative, bad-mouthed, and boring.''

 Housewife <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is crass, pushy, all dolled up and yearning to be appreciated and loved. As such, the star of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Married ... With Children'' is much like the upstart network that the sitcom has led out of the ratings wilderness. This past week `` Married ... With Children'' got a 13.4 rating, the highest ever for a Fox show, and for the second time this summer it beat the network competition. The <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rating is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The show ranked 17th in the Nielsen ratings, right there with the big-time competition of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Golden Girls'' and `` Empty Nest.'' `` Married ... With Children,'' which pokes fun at the happy, wholesome families on television sitcoms, has been criticized as too raunchy, but <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> has no intention of toning it down. The publicity, if anything, has helped the show. The show does push the limits, but it's also incredibly funny. <PERSON> Katey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagal </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, the lazy, sex-starved housewife, and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> is loutish <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who'd rather roll his socks than satisfy his wife's longing. They have a sluttish daughter, a delinquent son and two lovey-dovey neighbors they are eager to disillusion. `` We're quite happy around here,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a happy place these days.'' That was n't always the case for <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. Media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s challenge to the three commercial networks is at last being taken seriously after getting off to a shaky start three years ago with a single late-night show. That show, starring <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, was a ratings bomb and lasted less than a year. It did n't begin prime-time programming until April 1987, first on Sunday, then on Saturday. This fall it expands to Monday. <PERSON> Chernin </PERSON> said he attributes the Fox success to two factors. `` I think there is a tremendous sense of momentum which helps viewers find <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>,'' he said. `` There's a lot of word of mouth, the press is writing more about us, advertisers are taking us more seriously and our stations are growing stronger. Everything is working together. `` The other key factor is we have tried to be as aggressive as we can about launching new series as early as we can. We've had new episodes on Saturday night since June.'' Two other <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' and `` Totally Hidden Video,'' have also done well in the ratings this summer. `` Open House,'' a revamp of `` Duet,'' premiered last week in 47th place. `` 21 Jump Street,'' a police show about young detectives, has attracted a large following among young people, although its ratings have never gotten it out of the cellar. This fall, it spawns `` <PERSON> Booker </PERSON>,'' in which maverick policeman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Booker </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieco </PERSON>, gets his own show. `` Booker'' debuts on Sunday, Sept. 24. `` Jump Street'' moves to Monday on Sept. 18, where it will be joined by a new show, `` Alien Nation.'' Fox expects to move its movie night to Tuesday in October. `` The <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON> Show,'' although not highly rated, is one of the most critically acclaimed shows on television. The Fox success comes at a time when the three networks are offering mostly reruns. It also comes at a time when network viewing is down, due not only to competition from <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> but from cable and pay networks, the growing power of independent stations and the growing popularity of videocassettes. Only 57 percent of the audience watched the networks last week. The real test for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> comes this month as the networks begin previewing shows for the fall season, which officially opens on Monday, Sept. 18. `` On one hand we'll have more competition in the fall,'' said <PERSON> Chernin </PERSON>. `` But two things make us optimistic. This same phenomenon happened last summer to a lesser degree. That's when <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> really started to grow. That growth continued into the fall and that makes us optimistic it will happen again. `` Premiering our shows over the summer builds familiarity before we go head to head with the networks. We're optimistic that we've already gained an audience and a foothold in those time periods.

 The cocaine trade has become so pervasive and so great an economic force in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that it threatens the sovereignty and security of nations. Billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in some cases corrupting the economies of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and more recently <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> on a scale that approaches the amounts they earn from legal exports. Cocaine cartels, producers and traffickers have established virtual autonomous states in remote areas and, with the support of local coca-growing peasants, operate out of the reach of the law. Anti-government guerrillas in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are arming themselves with millions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers, with whom they have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, traffickers have formed private armies with intelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of aircraft. In the past decade, they have killed 220 judges and other court employees, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorney general, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others perceived as a threat to their business. But it was the assassination last month of the popular presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> that left the nation in outrage and prompted the government to launch all-out war against the cartels. In <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, however, officials say the overall war against the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort and greater resources for effective coca-leaf reduction and interdiction programs. Peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The implications for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and for other Latin American nations, where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes, are crucial,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` The traffickers in a variety of ways are out to suborn and destroy the democratic system in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> as in other countries of the region. This is nothing less than a war to decide who will govern these countries.'' <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> added: `` Both producing and consuming nations should take heed of what is happening in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. There is no such thing as benign drug production or consumption. The sovereignty of producing nations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca planted and with every dollar spent on a cocaine high.'' `` What we require is a regional approach to the problem because otherwise whatever plans we have in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> would be affected by events in other countries,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrico </PERSON>, under secretary of the interior in charge of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s drug interdiction programs. Already there is concern that the offensive against the Colombian cartels will drive the traffickers to other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations where vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control air traffic. Increased border patrols have already been set up in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. So far, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's anti-drug strategy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been based on an effective interdiction program involving the seizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destruction of cocaine-producing facilities. The intent was to drive down the price of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops. Operation `` Snowcap,'' a multi-nation cocaine interdiction program central to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy, has destroyed since its inception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43 metric tons of cocaine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents and local police forces have in recent years increased their operating capacity but as police activities become more effective, traffickers use their vast resources to bribe judges, district attorneys and police officials. Despite a greater <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in drug producing nations, cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says. As a result, cocaine prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have steadily declined, making cocaine and crack more available. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are now the growth markets for cocaine. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> produced 348 to 454 metric tons of pure cocaine in 1988, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government figures. With cocaine selling wholesale in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for $ 15,000 a kilo -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- or higher and retailing for $ 50,000 to $ 120,000, the value of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cocaine is worth at least $ 5 billion wholesale and at least $ 17 billion retail, many times the legal exports of drug-producing nations. In <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, an impoverished country of 6.9 million people, the cocaine produced is worth at least $ 1.7 billion wholesale. From that an estimated $ 300 million to $ 500 million flows back into the economy, compared with $ 600 million for all legal exports combined.

 For <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s beleaguered economy, $ 700 million to $ 1.2 billion enters the economy while legal exports bring in $ 2.5 billion. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government allocated $ 54.9 million for cocaine interdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989 for all countries south of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a $ 65 million emergency package for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s anti-drug war. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allocated to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> $ 10 million for fiscal 1989, $ 5 million less than in 1988. A single planeload of cocaine from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> _ usually about 14,500 pounds _ would fetch $ 10 million for the shipper. Bolivian anti-drug police trained by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and assisted by members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agents have destroyed three cocaine labs and 5,723 cocaine paste processing pits, compared to 3,542 pits in 1988. But vast areas of the Bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond their reach and traffickers' planes fly cocaine from the northern regions of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> without interference. At least 60 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts operate in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> alongside 1,050 Bolivian anti-drug police. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is becoming an important money laundering and trafficking center in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Cocaine shipments for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to wood and handicrafts. While coca-leaf production is relatively small in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, traffickers are using that Andean country as a transit point for drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- DEA -RRB- says. Police estimate that $ 200 million to $ 400 million was laundered or invested in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> last year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provides <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> with $ 1 million a year for interdiction activities. `` As pressure increases in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, cocaine trafficking will increase in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> because traffickers will move to the country with the least amount of pressure,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> DEA station chief for <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> have expressed concern in editorials about the danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drug cartels. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s most publicized case so far, two judges signed an order for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker. The judges then fled into hiding. One was captured later with nearly $ 20,000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff. The other judge and the trafficker are still at large. The security threat in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is concentrated in the expanding insurgency of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla organization that in the last two years has received millions of dollars from its involvement in the drug trade. The money has allowed <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> to better arm itself and is the principal reason the Peruvian government is concerned about the drug trade. At the same time, corruption of lower-level officials and police in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> hampers government efforts to wipe out the cocaine trade in the jungle region. In the campaign for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s national elections this year, some congressional candidates received backing and money from cocaine traffickers. Bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns or areas as their own. When police tried recently to capture <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> and Colombian traffickers in the town of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, hundreds of townspeople came to the traffickers's defense and forced the police to leave. The town is considered a haven for traffickers. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borja </LOCATION>, a cocaine trafficking center, police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces of cocaine, but thousands of area residents forced them out. Cocaine corruption has reached high places in the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government in years pase. A right-wing government installed after a military coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, that government's minister of the interior, is under indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, says several hundred million dollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. `` We can win the war,'' he said, `` but we must change the focus so that the war is backed by the people of the country.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug officials are concerned that a disruption of cocaine production in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because of the government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to other crops. An estimated 300,000 people in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> depend on coca farming and cocaine production for a livelihood. Coca leaf still provides a 100 percent profit to farmers and coca-leaf acreage increased by 20 percent in 1987-88, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. For farmers to stop growing coca leaves, viable alternative crops must be found. But with the recent drop in the price of coffee _ a crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown _ and the lack of other profitable alternative crops, farmers prefer to grow coca, which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell. The Bolivian government last year passed a law that limits coca-leaf acreage. President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>'s government, which was sworn in Aug. 6, says it will wage an all-out war against traffickers. Coca-leaf reduction in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is moving ahead but slowly as the new government implements an anti-drug strategy. Bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12,350 acres of coca land by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. If the quota is not reached <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> stands to loose $ 10 million in aid. This year so far only about 3,200 acres have been destroyed. In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, coca leaf reduction programs in the 150-mile <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 300 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, have been temporarily suspended because of threats to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents and the killing of Peruvian officials. Coca farmers and traffickers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have allied themselves with insurgency groups, among them the Shining Path, and many coca-leaf producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials. Eradiction and interdiction activities in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> area. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> destroyed 12,670 acres of coca in just four months last year. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> produces coca leaves on 285,600 acres. It is the main supplier of paste for Colombian cocaine producers and distributors.

 Not a lot of people would have seized upon this casting: <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> of `` Dynasty'' as a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nun taking care of orphans.

Her new charges _ ranging from a pint-sized Rastafarian to a boy-crazy teen-ager _ have prided themselves in running off a series of kindly old priests. Of course, in Sister <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> they meet their match. `` Sister Kate'' is predictable fare, but a nice family comedy, and <PERSON> Beacham </PERSON> looks like a break-out sitcom star. The show is well-paired on Sunday night with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` My Two Dads.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has slotted the new <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> comedy `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' after the broad comedy `` Night Court,'' which by comparison looks like a candidate for `` Masterpiece Theatre.'' The humor in the preliminary pilot for `` <ORGANIZATION> Nutt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' which will undergo some changes before its premiere, ranged from broad _ the hotel boa constrictor is dispatched to make quick work of a rat _ to slapstick _ `` Suing <PERSON> Sadie </PERSON>'' attempting to fall down the stairs. <PERSON> Cloris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leachman </PERSON>, equipped with fake bosoms and derriere, is the oversexed head of housekeeping for the large and wacky <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> is the foppish hotel manager. In the pilot, the fate of the hotel hangs in the balance as a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoon plots to buy it and the heir to the hotel fortune -LRB- <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> -RRB- is a party boy extraordinaire, ill-prepared to handle the responsibility. `` I'm a ne'er - do-well,'' he `` The only thing I do well is ne'er.'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> is executive producer with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a kind of protege of <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> who created the wacky `` Sledge Hammer!'' of a couple seasons ago.

 What you want to see in CBS' zoo drama `` Peaceable Kingdom'' is a lot more of the animals and a lot less of the people. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> -LRB- `` Bionic Woman'' -RRB- plays <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Cafferty </PERSON>, the new director of a large metropolitan zoo who is struggling to meet the conflicting demands of research science, animal welfare and city budgets. But <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> is resourceful. To extract quick disaster assistance money from a balking bureaucrat, she whips a tiny monkey out of her purse at lunch. But animal rights activists should n't worry. This series would make anybody like animals more than the people. Another veteran of bad network televsion, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> -LRB- `` Dukes of Hazzard'' -RRB-, plays <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>'s brother, conveniently the curator of mammals at the zoo. <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON>, a country-western singer, croons to the lions. Luckily, they do n't attack. <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> also has three children, 16, 12 and 6, who are variously delighted and chagrined at living on the zoo grounds. `` Face it, Mom, it's a zoo around here,'' notes one after a visiting seal breaks a vase. Opening CBS' Wednesday lineup, `` Peaceable Kingdom'' is a candidate for first show to be canceled. It might have had a better shot with less <PERSON> Wopat </PERSON> and more wombat. As <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> says in a moment of profound wisdom: `` The lion is dead. Do n't take it out on the gorillas.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> left prison five years ago, no one believed he was a changed man. After all, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> began smoking marijuana at age 13 and graduated to snorting cocaine and heroin at 14, feeding an appetite for drugs that for two decades dictated a life of crime. `` I knew the ins and outs of drugs,'' he says, explaining that as a youngster he had seen the debilitating effects of illicit drug use, `` but it was the slick thing to do. I wanted to belong, to do what everybody else was doing at the time.'' So at 13, he began an involvement with drugs that would last almost 20 years. Now a successful businessman who spends his free time speaking at churches and counseling inmates at the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> correctional facilities in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says he is committed to help others change the dead-end course of their lives. `` My whole life had been filled with drugs'' and hustling, said the 45-year-old <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose closely cropped hair now has an even mix of gray. Occasional use of marijuana, then cocaine and heroin, became an obsession by age 15, and `` that's when the crimes increased because I had to get drugs every day,'' he said. At first, money for the drugs came from petty thefts and what he described as `` yoke robberies'' _ strong-arm robberies or holdups without weapons. Despite all of this, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> continued to attend school and to conceal his drug habit and crimes from his mother, a Christian who demanded church attendance. Most of the expensive clothes and jewelry he bought with his ill-gotten money were stored at friends' houses <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s first car at age 16 _ a 1964 Mustang that then held the same prestige as today's BMW _ was parked around corners and in friends' garages and driveways. `` Robbery was the thing in the'60s; we went from bank robbery to robbing private businesses,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, whose first adult arrest came in the summer of 1966 when he joined some friends who hijacked a truck full of merchandise. The charges were later dropped. His profession as a thief ended in April 1968 when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was arrested for felony murder after an accomplice shot a clerk during a postal robbery. While waiting 18 months in jail to go to trial, he met two men from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who convinced him that selling drugs would reap greater profits faster. So when charges again were dropped, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where his friends `` introduced me to a new hustle, selling drugs.'' `` The money came so fast, there was no comparison'' with money from the robberies, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` That's part of the problem today. The money is fast. There is no money in the world faster than drug money.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s success was meteoric. `` I was able to acquire a grocery store, a new home, an apartment building, new cars, fine clothes, jewelry and traveled around the world. I met people that put me in a position to get more and better drugs.'' But as his business skyrocketed, so did his craving for drugs. `` I went from snorting drugs to shooting drugs because I had a raw habit,'' he said. `` When you become your best customer, you become unreliable, as far as the supplier is concerned, as far as paying money back.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s drug suppliers entrusted him with smaller and smaller amounts of drugs, dropping from 10 kilograms down to five kilos and then three. He also had frequent skirmishes with the law and was convicted four times on drug charges. `` When you know people, getting drugs or going to jail was n't a problem to me because my life pattern never had to change,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, explaining that drugs were `` just as plentiful in jail as on the streets, if not more plentiful.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who married at age 17, said his son brought him drugs in prison, concealing them in tennis balls or using other ingenious smuggling techniques. `` My last arrest had me facing 60 years in jail,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, but he was sentenced to only 20 months-to-five years at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>. It was during his last incarceration that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> met several <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> inmates who persuaded him to change his life. After his release, he was still viewed skeptically by his family, especially his wife who had left him three years into the marriage. `` People did n't want to believe it. They've heard before I'd changed and then I'd come out and do the same thing,'' he said `` But the longer I stayed out the more they had to re-evaluate whether or not I was serious.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s family began to respect his commitment. Then in April 1988, his 24-year-old son, a dealer himself, was killed on the street, shot nine times. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said he successfully suppressed his urge to retaliate against his son's murderers. Today, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is production manager of a print shop in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, making $ 40,000 a year that he can spend `` without worrying about the police kicking my door in.'' After a 20-year separation, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and his wife reunited last November and live in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

 When law officers arrested high school dropout <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Tony <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> just a month short of his 25th birthday, they gawped openly at his $ 730,000 <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> home and fleet of luxury cars. This was no Wall Street financier or wunderkind film producer. Like many young people seeking their share of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream, <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> amassed his fortune the new-fashioned way _ he sold cocaine. His 100-employee, multimillion-dollar operation was based in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Laurelton </LOCATION>, the working-class section of south <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> grew up. His headquarters was the corner of <LOCATION> Merrick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and 226th Street, but he also sold drugs in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Mickens operation was n't the largest in drug-infested south <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. But authorities said it was one of the most sophisticated. `` How many 25-year-olds do you know who can accumulate so much wealth and know how to launder illegal money?'' one investigator said after <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' arrest last year. Two months ago a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> federal jury convicted him of 16 counts of drug conspiracy, tax evasion and money laundering. He faces sentences totaling 220 years of prison time. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simels </PERSON> maintains his client's innocence. He argues that the fabulous wealth was left by <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' late father, said to be a big-time Queens numbers runner. But <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the Eastern District of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> personally cleared at least $ 2.5 million in cocaine profits in the 3 -LCB- years before his arrest. Like other young drug kingpins, <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> spent it freely and lavishly, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. In <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' circle, incredible sums of money changed hands, packed in bags and shoeboxes. With sacks of cash and stacks of money orders, <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> bought a $ 100,000 custom <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> equipped with a pair of television sets, VCRs and videogames. He maintained a fleet of sporty, expensive cars _ BMWs, Porsches, <ORGANIZATION> Ferraris </ORGANIZATION> and Mercedes-Benzes _ in which the popular young man took neighborhood kids for rides. `` He was the big talk of <LOCATION> Laurelton </LOCATION>,'' said a teen-age neighborhood girl, who declined to give her name. `` They'd talk about his cars, and how ` fly' they were, how nice.'' <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> took his moniker from <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>, the violent, high-living cocaine-addicted gangster portrayed by actor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> in `` Scarface,'' prosecutors said. `` He tried to model his existence after that character,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> of the Queens narcotics squad. His fascination with the movie was complete: he named his businesses after <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>, and several copies of `` Scarface'' were found in <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' home and in his limousine. Agents who arrested <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> at his home in exclusive <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> were amazed to find a Jacuzzi for 10 and a spiral staircase that ended at a fully outfitted workout gym. He wore fancy clothes and gold jewelry and owned homes in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he docked his 38-foot-long yacht. `` That someone so young could become a multimillionaire by selling cocaine shows how tempting and lucrative the business is,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pileggi </PERSON>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> showed financial savvy in making his purchases and hiding his income. Much of his property was registered under false names or by his girlfriend, <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, who was convicted of helping him launder money. Major purchases were made in installments under $ 10,000 to avoid federal financial reporting requirements. Unlike most drug dealers, <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' empire went beyond the cocaine trade: He owned several stores, the <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleaners </ORGANIZATION>, all of which _ along with the houses, boat and cars _ were seized by the government. <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION>, one of those companies, sponsored a team in a summer basketball league in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> also coached the team; among the players was <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, guard for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> `` enjoyed a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in testimony at <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON>' trial. Others also defended him. An old friend told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> that wealth notwithstanding, <PERSON> Mickens </PERSON> had not changed very much. He was still `` one of the guys, not <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> the drug dealer, just cool <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> the guy we grew up with.''

 No one can accuse <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> of resorting to stale, old formulas with `` <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howser </PERSON>, M.D.'' In the pilot, our hero interrupts his driving test to administer emergency medical aid at the scene of a traffic accident. So why is a doctor just now getting his driver's license? He's only 16. The half-hour `` dramedy'' is the first show to derive from <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s multimillion-dollar development deal with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Howser'' is a well-made show but it remains to be seen what audience will take to an offbeat pairing of adult and teen themes. In the pilot, <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> wins his first kiss and loses his first patient. The series is slotted in a decidedly adult time period, replacing <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>'s other dramedy, `` Hooperman,'' on Wednesday. <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> says it is feasible that a child genius, who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> at 10, could have a medical license at 16. The premise interested him because his late father was a violin prodigy. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is an excellent actor, and taking the same character in and out of parallel lives is kind of interesting, dramatically. But do we want to watch <PERSON> Doogie </PERSON> make life-and-death decisions at the hospital, then come home and sulk because his father -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikking </PERSON> -RRB- wo n't loan him the car? <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> has tried to do something different here, but it has ended up just being kind of weird.

That is going to demand patience, persistence and drudgery, long after the drama of a nationally televised re-declaration of war has faded. The government has declared war on drugs before. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has commanded such an effort before. And the government has reported some progress, but against a changing and growing target. Now, as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is setting a course to redeem a campaign pledge underscored in his inaugural address: `` Take my word for it: this scourge will stop.'' As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlines his drug-fighting program in an address to the nation, Americans are said to be ready to make war on drugs whatever the cost, even if it takes a tax increase. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said it wo n't, that the needed funds will be shifted from other programs. `` In key ways today, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are in a wartime mode and sense a national emergency in the drug crisis,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, reporting on an early summer poll his organization conducted for the drug-fighting effort. That sense of crisis has since been heightened by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government crackdown on the drug lords blamed for the murder of a presidential candidate there, and said to be responsible for about 80 percent of the cocaine flowing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already is sending $ 65 million worth of arms and equipment to help the Colombians combat the drug cartels. The broader administration program will propose up to $ 260 million in economic and military drug-fighting aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is presenting a strategy report required by the law that set up the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the new agency <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> heads. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have left the report to his drug czar; by delivering it himself, in his first nationally televised address from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president puts the drug crisis at the top of his autumn agenda. There's likely to be more drama in the medium than in the message. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has said again and again that there is no magic bullet to be fired in the drug battle. His report sets goals far more cautious than the rhetoric of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign or inaugural address _ a 10 percent reduction in drug use in the next two years; 50 percent in 10 years. The tools include increased federal aid to local law enforcement agencies; more prisons to house drug offenders; tougher and more certain punishment; more funds for drug education and treatment; interdiction efforts that will increase the role of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. During the 1988 campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advocated execution of big-time drug dealers. `` For those who commit drug-related murders, for the drug kingpins who are poisoning our kids, the penalty should be death,'' he said. `` If this is war then let's treat it as such. Let's get these killers off the streets.'' That proposal has not been mentioned in advance discussion of the drug strategy report. All told, the administration plan would cost an estimated $ 8 billion, about $ 2 billion over the current budget for the programs involved. There will be debate on whether that's enough, how much should be spent, and how it should be used. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a prime sponsor of the bill that created the new drug policy agency, has complained that the government so far has n't been willing to pay what's needed to fight the drug epidemic `` We have no war on drugs,'' he told a mid-August conference of corrections officers. `` We need a D-Day, we do n't need another <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who is to deliver a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the president speaks Tuesday night, proposed this week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> set up a system of debt relief for Latin nations that subsidize shifts away from the coca crops that are the raw material of cocaine. The Gallup survey, conducted in June and July and donated to the drug agency, reflected a D-Day mood. The poll of 1,005 adults and 500 teen-agers showed that Americans consider drugs to be the most serious problem facing the nation, with no other single concern even coming close. Gallup said the survey showed a public willingness to sacrifice as in wartime, with a majority favoring increased spending to combat drugs and willing to pay higher taxes if necessary. By all those measures, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> address comes at prime time on the calendar as well as the clock, to a nation fed up with the drug crisis and ready for action. That bodes well for the send-off. The greater challenge may come in finding the staying power for a drug war that wo n't end any time soon.

 Pupils returning this fall to <ORGANIZATION> Sandpiper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near this quiet, well-to-do <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community will find much of their schoolyard off limits. Not because of construction, or asbestos, or hazardous waste, but because of the power lines next to the school that can carry 230,000 volts. Emanating from the lines are electromagnetic fields _ present wherever there is electric power _ that have been linked to everything from cancer to miscarriages, chronic depression and learning disorders. Galvanized by reports of possible health risks, parents took the school board to court last November. When classes started in January, before a ruling came down, some parents kept children home or sent them to private schools. `` I saw it as a gamble with my children's life,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenner </PERSON>, a stockbroker who sent his 9-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, to private school this year and plans to do the same for his 4-year-old son <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>. `` The dosage they're receiving now may not affect them for another 20 years.'' In their lawsuit, <PERSON> Tenner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> contended that the electromagnetic fields from a series of power lines that begins 135 feet from the nearest school building may be harmful to their children's health. <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> ruled this summer that there was insufficient evidence of potential harm to close the school as the parents had asked, but he did close much of the schoolyard during recess and barred outdoor activities in an area that includes art and music rooms and the cafeteria. `` The evidence is clear that both electrical and magnetic fields affect the human body,'' he said. `` Depending on the dosage, the result can be harmful to the human body, increasing the incidence of cancer and other disease.'' Although research has not proven that electromagnetic fields are hazardous, it does show that power at 60 hertz -LRB- cycles per second -RRB-, a frequency commonly used in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, can produce biological changes in humans. A recent <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> report for the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> noted `` legitimate reasons for concern'' over <ORGANIZATION> EMFs </ORGANIZATION>, and even more disturbing, fields from sources like household wiring and appliances. `` The results are very complicated,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s Engineering and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and helped prepare the report. `` I think everybody agrees looking at the science that it's most unlikely the fields will be an initiator of cancer. The way the fields appear to interact with cells is the very elaborate processes on the surface of the cell. That's why the notion of cancer promoter has gotten going.'' The report also noted that construction of power lines is increasingly beset by public intervention and lawsuits. The issue is expected to heat up in states including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Already suits have forced utilities to delay, reroute and even scrap planned construction. One Canadian utility has offered to buy homes along a power-line corridor. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, among several states with electric field standards and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields, strong opposition is building from homeowners, parents and environmentalists to proposed 500,000-volt lines in the west-central and southeastern parts of the state. Should scientists prove that fields are dangerous, the implications would be staggering. It would be `` a multibillion-dollar problem to correct,'' said Buck Oven of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may be we will have to come up with an alternative method of getting power to people.'' Even if additional research turns up nothing, `` public perception is a powerful driving force,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinka </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, whose members produce nearly all the state's power. The <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> school case is being closely watched. Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Marraffino </PERSON>, who represented the parents, hailed it as one of the first `` to have judicial recognition that these fields can cause harm.'' School board lawyer <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> said, `` I have to take the position the judge was saying there's not anything there yet'' because he did n't completely close the school. `` Even if there's an association, the risk at <LOCATION> Sandpiper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> is no greater than that at the home environment.'' Marraffino disputes the contention that children are n't threatened `` I think we're just at the stage now maybe asbestos was many years ago. They're still trying to understand the mechanism by which it works. There's no doubt in my mind in 10 years, it's going to be a foregone conclusion.'' <PERSON> Poulton </PERSON> reserved the right to alter his ruling, if necessary, based on additional scientific data. In post-trial motions, he also ordered the school board to pay for periodic radiation measurements, but he refused to let parents transfer children to nearby schools after the board argued that parents would seek transfers for a host of environmental concerns. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> recalls taking her concerns to the board. `` They were real hung up on conclusive proof. That means names on death certificates, and I did n't feel that was the right approach.'' The Rausches believe EMFs may have contributed to the death from brain-stem cancer in 1985 of their 8-year-old son <PERSON> William </PERSON>. The school where they had lived before, in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, had power lines out front. If not for the lines, Mrs. <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> would have preferred sending her two youngest children to <LOCATION> Sandpiper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, a sprawling campus of one-story tan brick buildings and portable classrooms attended by more than 1,000 children. Unable to transfer 10-year-old <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> and 7-year-old <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> to another school or to afford private school, the Rausches turned their living room into a classroom and now teach their youngest of three children at home. For years, scientists were convinced there was no risk because 60 hertz power produces extremely low frequency fields that do n't cause tissue damage as do other forms of electromagnetic radiation like X-rays and microwaves. But the view of `` categorically no harm'' is on hold as evidence of effects builds. `` By and large the scientists do n't have their minds made up. They are genuinely puzzled,'' said <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. `` There are enough suggestive studies that we ought to continue exploring this.'' One of the most puzzling aspects is how much exposure for how long may pose a health threat. In fact, higher voltages may not necessarily be worse than lower ones; tissue may only be affected at certain levels. Epidemiological studies have found a higher incidence of cancer in exposed groups. In the so-called `` henhouse project,'' fertilized chicken eggs exposed to pulses at 60 hertz produced a greater proportion of abnormal embryos. Other studies have found increased enzyme activity in tumor cells, changes in the functioning of the genetic material DNA and RNA, changes in the calcium flow across cell membranes, changes in the neurotransmitters which send signals between nerves and changes in the hormones that control the biological clock. Still other studies have found no link between fields and health effects. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report noted that the epidemiological studies have shown `` a weak association'' between field exposure and leukemia and nervous system cancer. Researchers also say that despite a dramatic increase in power consumption over several decades there's been no accompanying rise in cancer rates. And if there was a problem, they say, the public would also have to be concerned about household appliances like coffeemakers, blenders, vacuums, electric blankets, hair dryers and shavers. Any risk would be quite small compared with other causes of death, such as smoking, according to researchers. The link between EMFs and cancer was first raised in the late 1970s in a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> study by <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeper </PERSON> of children living near power distribution lines. More than a decade later, public awareness will mean more battles for power companies and added pressure for intensive studies. All sides agree that a major research effort is the key to settling the debate over electromagnetic radiation. Millions are being spent on studies, by the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the research arm of the power industry, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, among others. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> also will include <ORGANIZATION> EMFs </ORGANIZATION> in a three-year study of childhood leukemia. Meanwhile, parents in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> and another group in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Davie </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light is facing stiff opposition to a transmission line proposal, say they'd rather play it safe than accept any assurances. `` I feel it's too unknown,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>, whose 5-year-old son is is going to a private school instead of the <PERSON> Davie </PERSON> elementary school being built near high-voltage power lines. `` I'm really that fearful You get five experts who say it's safe and five that say it's not. `` I just do n't want to take the chance.''

<HEAD>Research Pushes Natural Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponzetti </PERSON> has heard all the jokes about natural family planning. Like the one about how people who use it are called parents. Or those who use the rhythm method have children in a rhythmic fashion _ every two years. But <PERSON> Ponzetti </PERSON> argues that advances in natural techniques have made effective birth control possible without pills or condoms or vows of abstinence, and says the poor image comes from its association with religious beliefs, primarily the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the ineffective rhythm method. `` The natural methods got linked to religion, but they can stand on their own. Many of the religious proponents are incredibly zealous,'' said <PERSON> Ponzetti </PERSON>, who teaches family studies at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and recently published his findings in the can receive training, usually in larger cities where there are doctors available for it. Cities where training is available include <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washigton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, he said. But <PERSON> Tyrer </PERSON> said the inconvenience of learning, plus the lengthy period of abstinence, makes natural family planning impractical. A 1982 federal survey found that only about 553,000 of 36 million women who used birth control chose natural methods. One reason is that it had a failure rate of 24 percent for the average user in the first year and `` most people do not find that acceptable.'' Proper use of natural family planning in research studies has produced much higher success rates but that does not reflect real world use, she said. `` It's usually limited to those with moral or religious concerns.'' <PERSON> Ponzetti </PERSON> contends that natural family planning could become more widespread and effective if it was properly taught during school sex education courses. It especially appeals to those concerned about the health effects of birth control pills and barrier methods like condoms and IUDs, he said. `` Once a woman charts her cycles, she will be amazed how regular she is,'' said <PERSON> Ponzetti </PERSON>, whose wife uses the method. `` It's like clockwork.''

<TEXT>
 The hulking roots of a toppled tree, covered by lush moss and surrounded by saplings, symbolize the extremes of life and death in one of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last virgin stands of spruce and balsam fir. The 110-acre stand, on the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> headwaters six miles from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, has faced threats from nature as well as man in the past century. What is left, owned by The Nature Conservancy, is in many places not a pretty sight. Saved by man from logging operations but ravaged by the great hurricane of 1938 and a spruce budworm attack in the early 1970s, the towering spruce trees, some estimated to be 350 years old, are few and far between. `` It looks sad up there now after the budworm. It was so pretty up there before,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, a paper company forester instrumental in saving the stand situated at <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pool </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. The boggy lowlands are not ideal for spruce and fir, and more impressive specimens can be found elsewhere, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>. But at <ORGANIZATION> Norton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` the idea is that they have n't been trashed. `` You can see what nature does to itself, too. ... It killed its own trees, and there's thick regeneration coming up underneath.'' The stand's inaccessibility _ it's 50 miles north of the state's last stoplight _ has helped protect it through the ages It faced its first threat in recorded times, from lumbering, in the late 1800s. The <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> bought it as part of 125,000 acres of timberland in 1888, and reached East Inlet 10 years later. The 10,000-acre East Inlet watershed had never been cut, but its spruce was in demand. The spring of 1898 was extremely dry, however, and the loggers were unable to float logs down to mills and railroads. After a few weeks, they gave up. There was a budworm onslaught from about 1910 to 1915, though it was n't nearly as serious as the infestation in the 1970s. The tiny worms, which later become moths, eat spruce and fir needles, sometimes killing the trees. Nature again wrought havoc in the hurricane of September 1938. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> estimated that at least 25 percent of the spruce and even more of the fir were blown down or broken. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> observed the destruction for the first time in 1941 when, at age 23, he was in the first <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> team surveying to mark trees for cutting. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> had bought <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> in 1926. `` Sometimes we seemed to go a quarter of a mile climbing on top of blown-down trees. ... You'd be perhaps 10, 15, 20 feet in the air, climbing over that stuff.'' The team recognized that the trees still standing were special, he said. `` Most of us had n't been in large old-growth stands before.'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> began cutting in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> in the late 1940s, though not in the area later protected. By the 1950s, with pressure increasing to cut the huge trees, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> and some colleagues began plotting actively to spare it. `` Some of us kind of decided, ` Gee, you know, let's kind of skip around that. We can always get back get to it. That's what we had to tell some of the other people in the company who said, ` Why did you bypass that?''' The <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and other conservation groups began expressing interest in saving the area that also held rare birds and plants. In the late 1960s, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> agreed to save the stand, but <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which took it over in 1984, for years declined to give the stand to the groups, saying the company was taking care of it. Champion eventually deeded the land to The Nature Conservancy in July 1987. By then, nature had wreaked havoc. In 1974, masses of budworms swept into the region in a five-year infestation. `` Lots of places, very close to 100 percent of the fir got picked off, and a lot of the other growth, the small trees underneath,'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. `` The spruce was a little bit more resistant to it, but it got hit badly up there. It really spoiled the looks of it.'' But <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> remains philosophical about <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pool </PERSON>'s future. `` In this part of the world, things are both man and nature, and unless they pave it over, nature recovers,'' he said. `` Another 100 years or so and it'll look good again.''

<HEAD>Georgia State Psychologist Finds People Eat More in a Crowd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A roomful of diners is probably a roomful of people eating more than they would if they were alone, according to research indicating that people on diets might do well to decline invitations to eat out. `` Eating in a social setting increases the duration of the meal. You're eating at the same speed but you're eating longer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who reported on his work in August's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist, hired 63 adults in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area to keep seven-day diaries of their how much they ate, what they ate, where they ate it and how they felt physically. People tend to eat 44 percent more food when eating with others than when eating alone, and the bigger the group the bigger the individual's appetite. In addition, the food eaten in social settings was often higher in fat and that eaten when alone was more healthful, he said. Contrary to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s expectations, he did not find many instances of people stuffing themselves out of the watchful gaze of others. `` I had expected to see people become closet eaters. That was n't the case,'' he said. The three-year study of nutritional habits is continuing at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, with more people to be hired to keep diaries. De <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the research could eventually yield a complete picture of what factors contribute to overeating.

 It's a bug-eat-bug world for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Blehm </PERSON>. The father and son breed good insects to eat bad insects at <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON>, one of 15 `` insectaria'' nationwide. Every day, <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> produces more than 80 million voracious critters, from ladybugs to wasps. Business has tripled in the past five years as farmers concerned about pesticides turn to natural options. Sales from the 15 insectaria total $ 25 million a year, the Blehms say. Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, plus backyard farmers. `` This is the future,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, an entomologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. `` There is a great need. The farmers are desperate.'' They're so desperate that some universities are adding classes on integrated pest management _ ways to hold down troublesome pests while cutting the use of pesticides. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecologists </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, is producing a video showing farmers how to work with such insects. Controlling pests with beneficial insects takes longer, and because pesticides kill good bugs along with bad farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying while waiting for the good bugs to do their duty. `` The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith,'' <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> said. `` He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's used to a quick knockdown. `` With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before you see a difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is that his crop is contaminated with bugs.'' <PERSON> Rincon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitova </PERSON> sells 15 species including beetles, mites and parasitic wasps that control flies around chickens and cattle. It even sells to moviemakers. A studio needed four gallons of maggots last summer. `` We shipped them <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> to their location site in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> said. More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest populations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding and releasing them.

 Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park and nearby forests are bouncing back from a brush with extinction and should be off the threatened-species list within a decade. But the long-term prognosis is uncertain because bear habitat continues to be pressured by development interests, either for resources or recreation, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Servheen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` All those pressures will continue in grizzly bear habitat. They'll never go away.'' In the short term, <PERSON> Servheen </PERSON> said, the number of bears with cubs during the last four years has been good, bears are more dispersed, mortality rates are down and, perhaps most important, few bears are seeking human food sources. However, agencies managing bears will need to continue working to protect the grizzlies and their habitat, he said. `` As soon as we say they're recovered and we drop our guard, we'll be in a crisis situation again.'' Two decades ago, grizzly bears fed largely at dumps in and near the park. In the early 1970s, the dumps were closed, a controversial move that forced the bears to go `` cold turkey'' off human food sources. Many continued to seek food from humans, leading to encounters the bears rarely won; so many were killed in the 1970s that there is no accurate count, but some put it at well over 100. Wildlife agencies and communities fenced dumps and garbage areas, campers were required to keep food out of bears' reach, bears _ especially females of reproductive age _ were moved, and public education campaigns were begun. Now, <PERSON> Servheen </PERSON> said, `` The goal is in sight. When we started, there was so much to do that the did n't know where to start. We've come a long way. It still could be several years before there is serious discussion of removing the grizzly from the threatened-species list, he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said much of the bears' future depends on the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` Biologists agree that the limiting factor for grizzlies is security and bears are thriving in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> because they are secure. ... The pressures are ever going to increase around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, whether it's a new mine, a new resort or timber sales.''

 Federal disclosure rules taking effect today will make it easier to shop for a credit card, fostering competition that could lower interest rates for the nation's 107 million cardholders. The regulations require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate, monthly fee, grace period and other terms in a chart on the application used to sign up customers. Until now, companies have not had to disclose a card's costs until it arrived in the mail, under federal regulations. However, a dozen states have their own disclosure rules.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street giant that recently settled federal securities fraud charges, has announced several senior management changes, including the appointment of a new president. The company said Wednesday that <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, 56, currently senior executive vice president, will succeed <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitanza </PERSON>, 65, as president. <PERSON> Vitanza </PERSON>, who has held the post since 1982, plans to retire Dec. 31 and will remain a consultant to the firm. <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, a Wall Street professional for 33 years, started with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 as an account executive. His responsibilities have included manager of retail sales, director of marketing and head of equity trading. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, said the appointment of <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> and others `` will further strengthen the firm for the competitive climate <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> anticipates for the 1990s and represent a natural extension of the broad restructuring the firm implemented in April.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most aggressive Wall Street investment firms and helped pioneer the use of high-yield securities known as `` junk bonds'' as tools for corporate refinancings and acquisitions in the 1980s. But its image was tarnished by an intensive government investigation that began nearly three years ago and stemmed from disclosures by now-imprisoned inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who had business dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>.

In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> began a drastic restructuring that included the sale of its retail brokerage unit and other changes that has roughly halved the firm's worldwide staff of more than 10,000.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Up In July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rebound in public works projects helped push the level of new construction contracts nationwide up by 2 percent during July, a survey found. The survey, by the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, found that overall construction last month rose to an annual rate of $ 256.6 billion, a three-month high, <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. That followed a 2 percent drop in June. Contracts for public works and utilities construction jumped 5 percent in July to an annual rate of $ 45.7 billion. July contracts for new non-residential buildings, mainly commercial, industrial and institutional structures, rose 2 percent to $ 91.8 billion. But residential home contracts were up a modest 1 percent, with multifamily houses and hotels declining slightly and single-family homes advancing 2 percent. `` It's still early to be looking for a surge of one family housing in response to falling mortgage rates, as July's data bear out,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> group's vice president and chief economist. `` In another month or two, when inventory of unsold new homes is worked down and recession fears subside, conditions will be right for a solid recovery of homebuilding.'' For the first seven months of this year the unadjusted total of all newly started construction was $ 149.8 billion, off 1 percent from the same period a year ago.

In addition, he said, the new company will broaden its product line to range from machines costing $ 15,000 or $ 20,000 to ones costing $ 200,000. The combination is a straight merger, so no money is changing hands. `` We have a marriage of two equals that is really something to watch out for,'' <PERSON> Poduska </PERSON> said in an interview.

<HEAD>Concerns Over Indoor Pollution Create Work For Toxin Cleaners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> says more than one person has compared his business to the Ghostbusters of movie fame. He has a team, armed with chemicals, that goes into offices to fight invisible enemies. The enemies in this case are the indoor pollutants that environmental officials say are threatening workers' health. Increased awareness of indoor pollution, which some say is as dangerous as the toxins floating around outdoors, is creating plenty of work for companies such as <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> BriteTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Five or seven years ago it was hard to go in and convince someone they had indoor pollution,'' said <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>, president and founder of <ORGANIZATION> BriteTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norcross </ORGANIZATION>, which franchises its services. `` They'd look around and say, ` I do n't see it.''' An <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> survey conducted last year found that 1,200 companies were providing indoor environmental cleaning or analysis work, most of it for radon or asbestos. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrad </PERSON>, director of the indoor air division of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Radiation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said many of these companies are expanding into the field of indoor air pollution, though the survey did not give a precise figure `` Our sense is it is a growing business,'' <PERSON> Axelrad </PERSON> said. `` A lot of -LRB- those doing -RRB- industrial hygiene work are finding pretty good demand for their services,'' he said. `` We definitely think this is an emerging issue,'' <PERSON> Axelrad </PERSON> said of indoor pollution. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report released last spring said pesticides, radon, asbestos, tobacco smoke, bacteria and mold inhaled in poorly ventilated offices may threaten the health of Americans as much as outdoor pollution. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report attributed more than $ 1 billion in medical costs from cancer and heart disease to eight indoor pollutants. The combination of indoor pollutants has earned the name `` Sick Building Syndrome.'' Americans spend most of their time indoors, and <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said that as more people become aware of the syndrome they want something done about it. People often are surprised by the pollution found in an office or other indoor environment, <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said. The toxins in cigarette smoke, for example, stick to walls and ceilings and stay there for years, he said. `` There are 350 types of gases and pollutants in tobacco smoke,'' he said. `` If the building was contaminated before, the residue is still there.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>, staff engineer at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a customer of a BriteTech franchisee, said hospitals are extremely concerned with indoor pollution. But he said that only in recent years has the means for fighting the toxins grown more sophisticated. `` We were very much concerned with odors. We ca n't have any because of our critical-care areas,'' Almond said. `` We used to have a can of Lysol, and that's what we used.'' Almond said the availability of indoor pollution-control companies is contributing to cleaner hospitals. With the growth of an industry that deals with something that often can not be seen, however, comes inevitable fraud, officials warn. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency conducts training programs for both pollution testers and `` mitigators'' and makes lists of participants available to its regional offices in an effort to minimize fraud. `` We know there are some con artists out there who come in with the mayonnaise jar, scoop up some air and then tell them -LRB- customers -RRB- they'll analyze it and get back to them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. BriteTech uses a variety of measuring tools and also talks to building occupants to determine the level of pollution. The company also suggests remedies and has about 20 formulas _ all non-toxic and biodegradable, <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said _ for cleaning indoor areas. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said the cleaning process involves spraying a chemical mist onto surfaces, which dissolves the toxins. There is no scrubbing, he said. The cleaning materials also are sprayed into ventilation systems, though in extreme cases installation of a new air conditioning system may be recommended. Though the cost of BriteTech service varies according to the type of surface and degree of pollution, <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said franchises generally charge 25 cents to 50 cents per square foot. BriteTech is a relatively new player in the indoor pollution field, having started in January. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said he believes BriteTech is the first franchisor in the industry. The company has 12 franchises operating in nine states. Franchisees must put up a fee of $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 plus $ 10,000 working capital. The Norcross headquarters provides training, materials and a full-time staff including a chemist. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said his company's revenues so far are about $ 3 million a year, and he is hoping for 45 units and revenues of $ 20 million by the middle of next year.

Major shareholders and some environmentalists said they approved of the marine scientist.

In a telephone interview from his office at <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on the southeast end of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> spoke of the spill. `` I think it's a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just for the animals but for the people in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. He declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the cleanup but said he would visit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in about two weeks for a separate scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of the spill. `` It will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and scientific questions with colleagues in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> will serve on the board until <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholder's meeting in April, when his name will be submitted for shareholder approval along with the other directors, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Born in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>'s career includes 26 years at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. He joined Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1977. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>'s principal research subject is the marine environment. He is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for Exploration of the Sea. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s board from among 100 names submitted for review. At the company's annual meeting in May, shareholders demanded changes in what they called <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` inadequate state of preparedness'' for dealing with future environmental problems. Although the pension funds ultimately voted for management this year, they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the Exxon appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders. At the May meeting, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> management agreed to create the six-member public issues committee, which includes four non-Exxon employees. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said the committee would review the corporation's `` policies, programs and practices on public issues of significance including their effects on the environment and worker safety and health.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has extended for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban Red Dye No. 3 as a cancer-causing food additive. The agency had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline, which was Wednesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in July passed legislation calling for further study of the coloring that gives marachino cherries their bright glow. The Senate has not yet acted on the legislation. Since 1960, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and other additives have been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market for an additional two years pending further study. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has granted dozens of extensions of the provisional listing since then. The agency, in announcing the latest extension Wednesday, said it has been evaluating research data submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Certified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The association maintains that the dye is not a primary cause of cancer and causes tumors only when used in doses higher than would ever be consumed through its use as a food coloring.

 The capital paper chase begins in earnest Oct. 1. In a city where photocopying and paper-pushing have been elevated to art forms, recycling is about to become the norm. `` Newspaper and office paper, we can produce that in great numbers,'' said <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the city's public works department. `` We read a lot of newspapers, we write a lot of memos, we prepare a lot of reports.'' In fact, the city estimates that 53 percent of the approximately 740,000 tons of trash collected each year is paper. The new recycling law will require office workers, government employees and residents to separate paper from the rest of their garbage. And in conjunction with the law, officials are encouraging lawyers to stop using yellow legal pads, which like other colored paper is not wanted by many recyclers. That is not a small matter, considering that the capital boasts the highest concentration of attorneys in the nation _ more than 30,000. `` Not to be melodramatic, but it's going to change the way we live,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Over the next five years, we are all going to have to change our definition of what we call trash.'' While the rules governing paper recycling go into effect Oct. 1, the city has an ambitious plan to begin glass, aluminum and metal recycling programs by 1994, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. A set of proposed rules stipulates that most city residents will have their newspapers collected on the same day that trash is picked up, while businesses and government offices will be required to hire private haulers to take away their newspapers and office papers. Condominiums and cooperative apartment groups, which pay for private trash collection, will be allowed to ask the city to pick up newspapers. The rules, which will be reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the next three weeks, allow businesses to apply for exemptions. However, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> cautioned that small stores and offices, rather than paper-producing monsters such as the federal government, are far more likely to avoid having to recycle. `` There are some businesses that are so small, use so little paper, that it does n't make sense for them to enter into a contract to have paper hauled away,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. However, she said most of those business wo n't receive exemptions, but will be encouraged to pool their paper resources with small businesses nearby. To help make the adjustment to recycling easier, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s office has produced an information sheet _ printed on recycled paper _ that will be sent to city residents and businesses The mailing spells out the rules, tells residents when their papers will be picked up and warns against mixing paper with regular garbage. Residents violating the regulations can be fined $ 25, while condominium groups and cooperative apartment organizations can be penalized between $ 100 and $ 400. Levies against businesses start at $ 400. In recent years, construction of new office buildings and the conversion of single-family homes to condominiums and apartments have contributed to a growth in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s trash rate, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. In 1981, according to district figures, the city collected 450,000 tons of trash. Last year, that figure swelled to 740,000 tons, and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> estimated that without recycling, the city would be producing 1 million tons of trash a year by 2002. The district, which has no landfill, must pay to cart its trash to neighboring <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` We just ca n't go on like this,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` This is just a first step in dealing with our solid-waste problem.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Thursday it has succeeded in confining a subatomic particle that can be used in a new chip device to vastly speed the work of computers. A <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the successs made it possible for the company to produce ultra-high speed optical-electronic functional devices with a computing speed more than 10,000 times that of the chips used in supercomputers now available. He said the company has decided to use the particle, called a polariton, because it has the feaures of both electrons and light. The official said conventional chips using electrons function relatively slowly, and scientists have been studying the possibility of using light to increase the speed. But light has the defect of being uncontrollable, he said. He said the chip device with the polariton is fast and controllable. The polariton originally was discovered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physicist <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopfield </PERSON> in 1960s. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> will produce a test chip device with polaritons by 1990 and adapt it for practical use in optical computers by 2000, the official said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan, whose failure may cost the government $ 2.5 billion, invested $ 100 million with inside trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, according to newspaper reports. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s heavy investments in high-yield, high-risk corporate securities are well-known, and were one reason why the recent federal savings-and-loan bailout bill banned thrifts from investing in such securities, called junk bonds. Articles in Wednesday's editions of The Los Angeles Times and The Orange County Register detailed other types of risky investments by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, including attempts to profit in various ways from takeovers. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> officials apparently had no knowledge of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s illegal information gathering, according to the Times, which cited unidentified sources familiar with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s operations. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> invested $ 100 million with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the Wall Street trader known for investing in companies that frequently became takeover candidates, was forced to liquidate the fund prematurely when he pleaded guilty to securities law violations The Times said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> statements showed the company hoped to reap a 29 percent return on the investment in the fund, but quoted unidentified sources as saying the company realized a 9 percent profit. The Register said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> broke even on the investment. Federal regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on April 14, the day after its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans to reopen an investigation into <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s collapse, a failure that regulators and analysts say could result in the government's most costly bailout, requiring more than $ 2.5 billion in federal funds. Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> dispute that figure, and say losses were brought on by the regulators who seized the thrift. In November 1986, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> pleaded guilty to felony insider trading. He paid a $ 100 million fine and is serving three years in a federal prison. The federal Office of Thrift Supervision found that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> made numerous risky investments with federally insured deposits, even after regulators, citing the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> expenditures, criticized the thrift in March 1987. However, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> fared well with some of its high-risk ventures. The Register said investments with British financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> earned <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> $ 31 million in 1986. In a related development, The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> reported in a copyright story prepared for Thursday's editions that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state official in late 1984 authorized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> to engage in $ 800 million in risky ventures and then became a director and officer of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> firm about the same time the firm received a $ 2.9 million investment from <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, commissioner of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan from March 1983 to Jan. 1, 1985, on Wednesday told the Republic he helped arrange a meeting that may have led to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s January 1985 agreement to purchase stock in <ORGANIZATION> TCS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial-services firm now known as <ORGANIZATION> TCS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said there was no impropriety and no conflict of interest in his relationships with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and `` I'm not going to apologize for anything,'' he told the newspaper.

 <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> has given up his title as chief executive officer after directing <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> through its darkest days and into an era of record profits <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 64, relinquished the company's reins Wednesday to <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Becherer </PERSON>, currently president of <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, the world leader in tractor and agricultural-implement manufacturing. `` The action ... is reflective of the commitment by <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors to an orderly and effective management succession plan,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said in a news release `` This new appointment indicates the board's confidence in his ability to continue to exercise the kind of effective leadership that will help ensure <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s progress in the years ahead,'' said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, who retains his title as chairman. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> said no firm date has been established for <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s retirement, although company policy mandates he step down in 15 months on his 66th birthday in December 1990. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> will remain very active in leading the company up until his retirement,'' <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> said. The choice of <PERSON> Becherer </PERSON> as heir-apparent signals the end of a remarkable near 40-year tenure which saw <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> take control in 1982 as the company stood on the brink of collapse. Deere accumulated $ 328 million in losses in two years, and its operating losses totaled $ 637 million in the six-year period 1982-87. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> orchestrated a brutal cost-cutting program and laided off about 12,000 workers as the farm crisis gripped the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and caused thousands of farm foreclosures nationwide. The problems were compounded by a 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and four other states that ended Feb. 1, 1987, when workers accepted a wage freeze. Since then, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> has led the 152-year-old company to its highest profit levels ever. Aided by a diversification plan that saw <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> enter insurance, consumer credit, mail-order catalogue and health maintenance fields, the company has flourished. In 1988, <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> earned $ 315.4 million on sales of $ 5.3 billion despite a crippling drought that cut corn and soybean yields in half in key states like <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Profits and sales again are on a record pace nine months into the 1989 fiscal year. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, an East Moline native, was the first person not a member of the <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> family by blood or marriage to run the company. But he's the ultimate company man. Raised a few miles from the corporate headquarters, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s father was a middle-level manager at a Deere foundry <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> in 1950 and rose through the ranks until attaining a seat on the board of directors in 1974. He was named president in 1978 and achieved the post of chief operating officer in 1979. <PERSON> Becherer </PERSON>, 54, joined <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> in 1962 and followed a course to the top similar to <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s in marketing and extensive overseas work. He joined the board of directors in 1986 and was elected president and chief operating officer in 1987.

<HEAD>Japanese Economists Criticize U.S. Result-Oriented Trade Approach</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Japanese economists said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could expect only greater frictions with its trading partners if it adopted an advisory committee's calls for a more `` result-oriented'' approach to lowering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The economists also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must re-examine such business practices as the tendency of Japanese doing business mainly with each other, manufacturers' dominance in price-setting, and discriminatory treatment against imported products. But while these practices may be frustrating to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exporters, they have little to do with the large trade imbalances of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Masaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshitomi </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The council presented a counterproposal Thursday to recommendations in February by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel, headed by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, recommended that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative take a more result-oriented approach to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. This would mean judging Japanese actions by how much they reduce the deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Yoshitomi </ORGANIZATION>'s group recommends handling trade imbalance issues separately from trade policy issues, saying that lowering barriers is a separate issue from achieving a balance between imports and exports. It argues that `` it is totally wrong'' to see a large deficit as reflecting a country's free trade practices and a large surplus as reflecting trade restrictions. `` Fundamental confusion is often seen in many journalistic articles,'' it says. Referring to growing protectionist sentiment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against Japanese trade practices, the report says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not be frustrated by the lack of progress in reducing trade deficits and should not let politicians use the sentiment politically. The report also attacks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' use against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of new trade legislation providing for retaliation if the two sides can not negotiate a solution to Japanese trade practices the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deems unfair. `` The global free trade system would completely break down if every country adopted the same policies based on unilateral judgments of unfair trade practices of trading partners in specific products, especially when no country always acts fairly, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' it says. <ORGANIZATION> Yoshitomi </ORGANIZATION> stressed that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must change in order to reduce their trade deficit, rather than simply demanding that its trade partners change. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technological hegemony was established through essentially a mass production system since early this century,'' he said. But the situation may have changed in favor of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, so that many aspects of the American system must adapt, he said.

<HEAD>Allstate Insurance Introduces Discount for Anti-lock Brake Systems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drivers of cars equipped with anti-lock brakes could soon be getting a break on their auto insurance rates. In a move that could set a precedent for other major insurance companies, <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it is offering a 10 percent discount on three major auto-policy coverages for cars with anti-lock brakes. `` This discount, in effect, is the first of its kind for a major carrier,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company, based in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>. The only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance company currently offering an anti-lock brake system discount is <ORGANIZATION> USAA </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a firm which provides insurance to military personnel and their dependents, <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said. Anti-lock brakes use an on-board computer to control wheel speed during braking, allowing faster and safer stops without skidding or loss of steering control. `` There's no question that the anti-lock brake system provides a remarkable amount of braking protection that is not available in regular brake systems,'' <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Geen </PERSON>, senior vice-president of <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based firm that evaluates car losses for the insurance industry, said he also has found that anti-lock brakes are effective. `` It's certainly been proven that the anti-lock brake system works very well and more manufacturers are offering it.'' <PERSON> Geen </PERSON> said he expected other insurance companies to follow <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s example in offering the anti-lock brake discount. <PERSON> Geen </PERSON> said there are few cars on the road with anti-lock brakes, but they should be available as an optional or standard feature on more 1990 model cars. The anti-lock system was introduced about six years ago, and until recently has only been available on luxury cars. It is now being offered as an option on more moderately priced autos, but no statistics are available as to how many cars now on the road in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have anti-lock brakes, <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said. The new discount offered by <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, covers cars equipped with four-wheel anti-lock brake systems. It provides for 10 percent off three coverages that are part of an auto policy _ bodily injury, property damage liability and collision.

<TEXT>
 The second big-time Wall Street securities professional in two weeks has reversed position and pleaded guilty to fraud charges that stem indirectly from the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. Stock speculator <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 50, unexpectedly entered a guilty plea Wednesday to three felony charges involving alleged fraud in the trading of <ORGANIZATION> Fireman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock more than three years ago. The guilty plea by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a well-known Wall Street figure and former special adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, came a month before he was to go on trial for charges his lawyer originally denounced as `` a piece of garbage.'' On Aug. 17, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, also implicated as an indirect result of the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal, said he would plead guilty to a single felony count for insider trading in <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> stock in 1986. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> originally had asserted his innocence. It was not immediately clear why <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> changed his position. Neither he nor his lawyer, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, would comment. But many lawyers have speculated that recent jury guilty verdicts in two other cases, involving takeover speculator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> and partners in an investment partnership called <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, convinced other defendants that juries are willing to deal harshly with suspects in white-collar fraud crimes. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> entered the pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to charges of manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund common stock, aiding and abetting the falsification of records and stock-margin violations. In addition, his brokerage firm, S.B. <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities laws violations. In a statement before the judge, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> did not provide a motive for the stock manipulation. The charges against <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> carry a total maximum 15-year prison term and $ 2.75 million in fines. His company faces up to $ 1 million in fines. A sentencing conference was set for Sept. 25. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and his brokerage were named in a 22-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury Nov. 3. The indictment claimed <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> manipulated Fireman's Fund stock price just before <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale of Fireman's Fund shares in 1986. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had a close working relationship with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's biggest financial services companies and parent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Wall Street investment house. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> was not named in the indictment but was portrayed as the intended beneficiary of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' alleged scheme. The company denied any wrongdoing and said it had cooperated with investigators. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> reiterated its position after <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> entered his guilty plea. In a press statement the company also said: `` We conducted our own internal investigation and concluded that no one at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> was involved in any wrongdoing whatsovever. We have had a longstanding business relationship with Mr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. We have always regarded him as a man of integrity and high profesional competence and we are saddened by this episode.'' Charges against <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, former head of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who turned state's evidence. Jefferies had been implicated by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned speculator who settled insider trading charges in November 1986. Federal prosecutors alleged <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> requested two unidentified Jefferies employees to buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on May 8, 1986, in an attempt to drive its price up to $ 38 a share, substantially above its price at the time The indictment also accused <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of promising to reimburse the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> employees for any losses and of hiding his role through phony records. On May 9, 1986, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> announced it would sell 8 million shares of Fireman's Fund at $ 41.50 a share. It eventually made a profit of $ 88 million from the sale.

 Credit card disclosure rules taking effect today offer the nation's 107 million card holders a new opportunity to shop around for lower interest rates, consumer activists say. Industry analysts, however, say they expect the new rules to have little impact _ at least over the short haul. The regulations, adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in April, require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate, monthly fee, grace period and other terms in a chart on applications used to sign up customers. Previously, the card's costs did not have to be disclosed until it arrived in the mail. The new rules also require companies to notify existing customers in advance when their accounts are about to be renewed and another annual fee charged. `` Consumers should use the renewal notice as a reminder to switch cards and save,'' said <PERSON> Elgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer group. He advised cardholders to pay off their high-rate cards with a cash advance from a low-rate card. The new rules apply to bank cards, such as Visa, <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> and Discover; to department store cards; and also to cards such as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, whose full balance must be paid monthly. `` I'm very hopeful that this will at least provide the edge to consumers to make better judgments,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other consumer activists believe the regulations should force card companies to compete by lowering their interest rates and annual fees. Bankers and analysts, however, say most cardholders probably wo n't see much decline. `` It's going to put some strain on banks charging above-market rates ... and some of the banks that have extremely low rates may see a little more business, but the vast majority are going to stay where they are,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's going to do much of anything,'' agreed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, publisher and editor of <ORGANIZATION> RAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>'s Bankcard Update, a <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, newsletter that follows the industry. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said competition has increased in the past several years, but rates are still high, even in the dozen or so states such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that have their own disclosure laws. Nationally, cards offered by banks had average interest rates of 18.28 percent in August and an average annual fee of $ 16.97, he said. One reason interest rates are not lower is the growing concentration of the industry as large institutions buy out smaller credit card operations, said <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>. Another is that consumers do n't appear to pay much attention to interest rates. Economists attribute the indifference to interest rates in part to the fact that most people intend to pay off their entire bill each month, avoiding interest charges. But a substantial portion do n't follow through on their good intentions. Credit card rates became a political issue in the early 1980s when short-term interest rates soared above 20 percent. Consumer groups sought disclosure rules and federal caps on the rates, but made little headway until they dropped their demand for caps. Although earlier disclosure of card terms should help card shoppers, <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said it still wo n't be easy to find cards with the lowest rates. Big national operations, which do the most advertising and mail solicitation, generally charge higher rates and fees. The best bargains often come from banks and savings institutions that, at most, advertise only regionally. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> said consumers should decide whether they will use it for convenience or to borrow. Cardholders who pay their entire balance monthly should look for a card with a low annual fee, or no fee. However, those who carry balances of $ 1,000 or more may find it cheaper to pay a fee in exchange for a lower rate. He lists some gimmicks that consumers should beware of, even with the new rules: _ Some cards with no annual fee compensate by charging interest rates of more than 20 percent The annual fee often is waived only for the first year. _ Other cards offer skip-a-payment options, but tack on added interest costs to the next bill _ Cards with low rates compensate by charging high annual fees or allow no grace period, assessing interest from the day of purchase Others advertise `` cost-saving'' variable rates that wind up being substantially higher than national averages for fixed rates. _ Some banks offer a lower annual fee or an interest-rate break, but only if customers maintain a checking account that carries a $ 5 or $ 6 a month service charge _ Other companies tout 1 percent rebates on purchases, but charge interest rates 3 to 4 percentage points higher than most cards

 The federal government clamped tighter controls today on the industrial handling and use of the cancer-causing chemical benzene, saying the new requirements will cut releases of the toxic chemical into the air by 90 percent. The regulations, some of which will take effect immediately and others within six months, would cut benzene emissions into the air by more than 34,000 tons yearly, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protecton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today's rules and proposals will lower the industrial emmissions of benzene by 90 percent,'' <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy administrator, said in the announcement The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the new requirements, some of which will be phased in over two years, will reduce the risk of the general population of getting cancer as a result of benzene exposure to less than one chance in 1 million. But the agency acknowledged the risk could be much higher _ perhaps one in 10,000 _ near some industrial plants where large amounts of benzene are found. The new controls come 12 years after the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> first listed benzene, a colorless, odorless liquid widely found in the chemical, steelmaking and petroleum industries, as a hazardous air pollutant. The sharpest emission cuts are expected to be seen in the steel industry where benzene has long been a chief byproduct with few controls on releases into the air, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The new rules cut those emissions by 97 percent, officials said. Sizable emission reductions also are expected in the transportation of benzene, in the pharmaceutical industry and in the transportation of gasoline from refineries to local service stations, the agency said. According to one <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official, as many as 100 million people across the country are exposed to some level of benzene pollution. Releases into the air can be found anywhere from steel mills and refineries to the corner service station. In addition to cancer, federal authorities concluded in the 1970s that chronic exposure to benzene also causes leukemia and birth defects and damages blood-forming organs. Details of the new benzene controls were n't disclosed in advance, but they are considered by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to be among the most costly issued so far in curbing toxic emissions. Initial capital investment costs are expected to exceed $ 1 billion over the next two years. There was no immediate estimate on what additional operational costs companies might face. `` We think this is an expensive standard. We think it's worth it,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Emison </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s office of air quality planning. In 1987, industry users reported more than 32 million pounds of benzene was released into the air, but environmentalists say that does n't count additional releases by small companies and other facilities _ such as gasoline stations _ that were not required to make emission reports. Benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for not moving more quickly to curb releases of such substances from the nation's plants and factories There are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must make annual reports of releases. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged that the task of developing comprehensive emission controls for benzene has taken too long, but blame much of the delay on the complex legal process they have been forced to follow. As part of its planned tightening of federal air pollution laws, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering a revamping of how the EPA deals with toxic chemicals, so the agency can issue broad regulations based on installation of technology that would curb emissions of many chemicals at the same time. The agency now must deal with each chemical separately _ as it has with benzene. Although some benzene releases are already controlled by either federal or state regulations, the vast majority of the releases are not. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, for example, says that the largest single source of benzene releases into the air stem from the production of coke in the iron and steel industry. Yet those releases have remained largely uncontrolled until now, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Significant releases also continue to occur in the transportation of benzene, as well as during the transfer of gasoline from refineries to retail service stations. Controls on releases in those areas are largely nonexistent, officials said. Federal controls have been in effect curbing benzene emissions from certain industrial equipment since 1984, but those controls cover only about 5 percent of all industrial releases of the chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> began regulating benzene releases in the workplace in 1987, but that does n't cover emissions outside the immediate work environment.

 It may not make your day to hear this, but the federal budget deficit will soon be back making news. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns to session after Labor Day facing a deadline just a few weeks away to shrink, somehow, the projected gap between income and outgo for the government fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. If it does n't succeed, then the law known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings calls for automatic cuts in spending to bring the deficit down within specified limits. `` The stage is set for intense negotiations over the budget in the coming weeks,'' says <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, political analyst for the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Unless something is done, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget staff says, the government will stand to run $ 116 billion, give or take a few hundred million, in the red for fiscal 1990. That's $ 16 billion more than mandated by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but a conservative estimate by comparison to others, who have projected deficits as large as $ 140 billion. It seems safe to assume that this will bring a lot of the usual scenes that have become so familiar in the 1980s _ wrangling between the administration and the lawmakers, late-night maneuvering and some sort of last-minute compromise that will keep the government lurching along. Lots of people will pay no attention, and why should they? The debate over the deficit has been going on since the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration at least, and the situation never seems to change much. Besides, whatever is done this fall, the underlying problem wo n't go away `` Any budget pain encountered in getting under the Gramm-Rudman ceiling for 1990 will be dwarfed by the ` agony' coming down the track for 1991,'' observes the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Report </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based newsletter. In that fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Gramm-Rudman </ORGANIZATION> calls for a deficit limit of $ 64 billion. Some people trace the origins of the much-bewailed `` breakdown of the budget process'' to the mid-1960s, when the nation was faced with a choice of how to spend its large, but still finite, resources. Should it build up its expensive role in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, or should it embark on a sweeping campaign to deal with domestic problems? Guns AND butter, decided President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The deficit widened with the recessions and oil crises of the 1970s, and got still worse during the `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution'' of the'80s. Along the way, Americans have taken part in a long experiment determining what happens to their economy in a period of chronic deficits. It turns out that policy measures taken in response to a deficit can cause severe economic slumps, runaway booms, or long periods of mere muddling through. They can foster rising inflation or declining inflation, higher interest rates or lower interest rates. In short, under the deficits of the past two decades, the nation has witnessed just about every conceivable economic environment _ except for the kind of calamity so many analysts of the problem have predicted. Logic still dictates that the government can not go on indefinitely spending more than it takes in. Experience has shown that it could in fact do just that for longer than many experts thought possible. Blamed for everything from the stock market of crash of 1987 to a decline in family values, the deficit persists. Having survived this far, it seems ready to take on the 1990s with plenty of energy left.

 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has moved its Northeast distribution center from the Port of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the second major shipper the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> port has lost in two months, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was transferring its shipping center to the port of <LOCATION> Davisville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, effective immediately. The West German automaker had shipped more than 100,000 cars up the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> in the last three years. The pullout will mean work reductions for up to 175 longshoremen, while about a dozen jobs will be lost in related businesses, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> shipped about 20,500 cars to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> last year, accounting for $ 135,000 in revenues, about 9 percent of the port's receipts The move comes after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which shipped bananas from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> for 17 years, moved its shipments to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, this summer. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> had been the port's biggest clients, accounting for 80 percent of longshoremen's work, union officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> was `` the last major, steady client for us, said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnwall </PERSON>, port manager for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the port. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> decided to leave <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> after 11 years despite incentives offered by the port and union leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> reported. Those incentives included freezing dock fees in 1990, the newspaper reported. `` It's simply more economical to import through <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> than to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> told the newspaper. Shipping sources said <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, facing slumping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales, had complained about the costs of doing business at the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> port.

<HEAD>BAT Takeover Could Fail, Goldsmith Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, one of the three financiers leading the hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday a British regulatory panel must extend its deadline or his takeover attempt will fail. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers requires that all conditions of a bid, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory hurdles, must be completed within 81 days of the posting of the bidder's formal offer document. `` If there is no extension from the panel it's very hard to see the offer succeeding,'' <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s consortium, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, posted its 13.4 billion pound, or $ 21.4 billion, bid for BAT and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiaries on Aug. 8, which leaves the group 58 days to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory requirements. London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, has significant interests in financial services, paper and retailing _ including such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings as the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> department stores and <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> on Thursday also launched an attack on regulatory commissions in several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states `` for obstructing the bid.'' `` The -LRB- state -RRB- regulators have got to ask themselves whether they are going to be a poison pill or are going to allow free trade,'' he said. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> is joined by British banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian investor <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> in leading the BAT takeover bid, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest to date. The British takeover panel said a decision on the extension request would be made in the next few weeks. BAT shares were down 14 pence, or around 22 cents, at 823 pence, or $ 13.10, a share on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s remarks. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> is offering 878 pence, or $ 14.10, a share for BAT.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose slightly in directionless European trading Thursday, while gold prices fell. Dealers said they avoided taking large positions on the last day of the month and before Friday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment data for July, which could give further clues to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth. `` There were no sharp moves today,'' said a dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank. `` We remain stuck in a range ahead of the jobs data.'' Volume was thin with many corporate traders absent from the market. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.20 yen to a closing 144.28 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 144.55 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5735 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5815 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday: 1.9580 West German marks, up from 1.9465; 1.6880 Swiss francs, up from 1.6770; 2.2090 Dutch guilders, up from 2.183; 6.6035 French francs, up from 6.5515; 1.1758 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1760; and 1,406.90 Italian lire, up from 1,389.50.

 Share prices ended higher but below the day's peaks Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market drifted in tentative trading. Stocks opened stronger and then rallied on unconfirmed rumors that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate finance specialist was considering taking a large stake in the British company <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. However, buying interest wilted at higher levels, encouraging several players to take profits, analysts said. A lackluster opening on Wall Street provided little incentive for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to push higher, they said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 6.6 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,387.9, but below the day's high of 2,394.3, up 13 points. At its lowest, the index touched 2,384.6. Volume was a healthy 447 million shares at mid-afternoon, up from 414 million traded by the same time on Wednesday. Traders believe that in the next few weeks the key 100-share index will be hard pressed to breach the psychologically important 2,400-point level. Dealers said the market is cautious ahead of an upcoming series of interim company earnings reports, which might confirm fears of a slowdown in British corporate profitability. `` This market's been driven by speculative stories and so no one wants to be reminded of the fundamentals,'' one dealer said. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended up 6.7 points at 1,977.6. The 500-share index was at 1,334.52, up 5.07.

 Ever since the coffee bean's muddy broth was first served 1,000 years ago, it's survived religious persecution, official banishment and suspected links to maladies ranging from heart attacks to male impotence. It's been written about, used for inspiration and put to music. <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> composed `` Coffee Cantata,'' which parodied those who sought to suppress the brew. French philosopher <PERSON> Voltaire </PERSON> reportedly drank 50 cups a day. Coffee as a drink first appeared in the year 900 in a part of Arabia that is now <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. It became so popular in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that Moslem priests complained the drink emptied the mosques. Coffee's rapid spread to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> led devout <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> to denounce it as an infidel's brew. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> the Great of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION> once banned coffee because he thought it threatened consumption of beer, the national drink. A study of coffee by Find-SVP, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> research concern, said coffee's success in 16th century <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> led women to agitate for a prohibition, claiming the drink inhibited the virility of their mates. In more modern times, medical studies have concluded the stimulant caffeine in coffee may contribute to higher cholesterol levels and heart disease. Health concerns about coffee is one reason it's popularity among Americans is diminishing, according to recent studies which show a long-term decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption. While three out of four Americans regularly downed at least a cup a day in 1962, only half of the population reported drinking coffee last year, a study by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> shows. In 1988, the average number of cups of coffee consumed per person per day was 1.67 cups, down from 1.76 cups in 1987 and 46 percent below 1962 when per capita consumption was 3.12 cups, the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> study found. Even hard core drinkers drink less _ 3.34 cups per day in 1988 compared with 4.17 cups in 1962. That does n't mean coffee drinking is doomed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which remains the largest market for coffee. Although Americans constitute only 5 percent of the world population, they still drink a third of the planet's coffee, about 360 million cups a day, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> shows. Americans have also become more selective about their brew. Consumption of instant coffee has dipped appreciably in the last three decades. Though the number of people drinking decaffeinated coffee last year was four times that of 1962, the amount consumed declined, from 17.5 percent in 1987 to 15.8 percent in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> study found. The most noticeable change has been in the habits of those 20-29 years of age whose per capita consumption fell from about 3 -LCB- cups a day in 1962 to less than one cup in 1988. People older than 30, who consumed more than 4 cups in 1962, now drink about two cups a day. Analysts also attribute the decline in coffee drinking to the rise in popularity of soft drinks, which has increased proportionally. Since 1985, soft drinks have overtaken coffee as the most consumed beverage. But consumer concern about natural, healthy foods also has led to a rise in the popularity of gourmet coffees. Despite the decline in overall coffee consumption, sales of gourmet blends have grown about 25 percent a year since 1975, says the Find-SVP study. Specialty whole bean and gourmet coffee now constitutes 8 percent of the total coffee market, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChillo </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. DeChillo defines gourmet coffee as high quality, flavored or unflavored coffee. The trend to increased supermarket distribution is the most significant development in the industry and in helping popularize gourmet coffee. It has also grown in restaurants. With the two biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roasters _ <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ getting into the act and expanding their marketing of gourmet coffees at supermarkets, sales of gourmet coffee, which totaled about $ 600 million in 1988, are forecast to double in another decade, the Find-SVP study says. Of the gourmet segment, flavored coffees are the fastest growing segment and the most controversial. Many purists shun flavored coffees because they consider them adulterated. But it is this segment that has captured younger consumers, who have grown up on soft drinks and sweeter-oriented taste buds, the Find-SVP study concludes. The research firm found that vanilla nut, Irish cream and chocolate are consumers' favorite flavors. Other favorites include cinnamon, chocolate raspberry and coconut.

 Swedish automaker <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, facing mounting losses and lay-offs, refused Thursday to confirm or deny news reports that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is a leading suitor for its ailing passenger car division. Following a board meeting Thursday, <PERSON> Jan-Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s auto division, declined to clarify a report in the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Expressen </ORGANIZATION> that a takeover deal with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was imminent. It has been rumored for several months that <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a buyer to help salvage its crisis-ridden passenger car division and to enable it to develop a successor to its stock 900 model by 1992. The 900 model, in recent years has run into hard times on the vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. When it was developed, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> managed to halve the costs by collaborating with Italian auto giant Fiat-Lancia. This time <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> reportedly first turned to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>' e <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, which is one-fourth-owned by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, and then turned to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> itself. According to the Expressen report, top-level negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> are nearing their conclusion. The paper reported that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, demanded a majority share of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, but other sources said the Swedish company is only willing to relinquish 20 percent to 40 percent of its stock. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said, `` We can neither confirm nor deny the report.'' <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> in a television interview Thursday night said <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> `` will remain a Swedish automaking company,'' indicating a possible refusal of a full take-over bid. <ORGANIZATION> SAAB </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnsund </PERSON>, who refused all comment Thursday, earlier had said `` we will seek to make it on our own.'' From <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s viewpoint a take-over of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s profit-making truck division could be a golden egg. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s top automaker <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> two years ago purchased <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>' heavy truck division. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sells hardly any heavy trucks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Scania </ORGANIZATION> truck division markets 75 percent of its products, which are partly produced in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> last year showed a record group profit of 3.2 billion kronor, about $ 484 million at current exchange rates, up 16 percent despite increasing losses in the passenger car division. In addition to automotive and engine manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> makes aircraft, weapons systems and electronic equipment. <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> on Thursday refused to confirm that the passenger car losses would mount to about one billion kronor for the first six months of this year and hit two billion kronor for the full year. However, he said losses would increase during the year from the 450 million kronor suffered in the first four months, which would virtually halve <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s profit for fiscal 1989. <PERSON> Larsson </PERSON> also said a tough crisis program, including a staff reduction of about 2,000 employees, will not take effect until 1991 and admitted that the automaker is in for a couple of tough years before it can hope to break even. According to Swedish business sources, the liquidity problem of the <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> passenger car division, reportedly losing about $ 2,500 on each car it produces due to high costs and setbacks on the dollar market, is so severe it had to borrow from the parent company to cover this months' wages.

<TEXT>
 Japanese banks, Goliaths of international finance, are growing even bigger, leaving their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts in the dust as they keep an eye on deregulation. The 10 largest banks in the world in terms of assets are all Japanese, led by <ORGANIZATION> Daichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has assets of $ 377 billion. That's more than <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the two biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks _ combined. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said they would merge in April, forming the world's second-largest bank with assets of $ 348 billion. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, four of the top 10 banks are Japanese-owned. Deregulation starting in 1991 will allow them to expand across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, backed by the strength of their huge parent companies. A look at the unwieldy names of Japanese banks shows how they got so big: The <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will combine the oldest bank in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with the results of a 1973 merger of <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Daichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kangyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bank </PERSON> is the result of a 1971 merger of its namesakes. And had <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> achieved its original three-way merger ambitions, the economic newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> says, there would have been a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kobe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Mergers of this scale are virtually unthinkable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where anti-trust regulations prevent the creation of firms judged large enough to restrict competition. They are also rare in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, senior <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> officials praised the <LOCATION> Mitsui-Taiyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> deal as good business strategy. The national bankers' association also welcomed the merger. Although <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taiyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobe </PERSON> were ranked seventh and eighth largest banks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, each significantly larger than any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank, `` neither bank was really big enough to fulfill its ambitions on its own,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it will look into the merger to see if it violates anti-trust laws, but the usually meek agency is not expected to block the deal. Next week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are expected to cite what they see as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s lax enforcement of anti-trust laws in talks on `` structural impediments'' to correcting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s big surplus in trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There have been fears that Japanese banks, with the enormous cash reserves pooled by thrifty Japanese savers, will dominate international markets just as Japanese car and electronics manufacturers have. In banking, largely through cheap pricing and high-volume business, Japanese banks already have made major inroads into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lending and in Eurobond issues. Because of their strong domestic market, where analysts estimate they make 90 percent of their profits, they can afford to take slim margins on their overseas business. But sheer size does n't necessarilymean profitability. <PERSON> Daichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kangyo </PERSON> is ranked first in the world in terms of assets, but only 77th in terms of return on equity, notes <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterhouse </PERSON>, an analyst at the securities house <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capel </PERSON>. Some analysts say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s banking is where its manufacturing was 20 years ago _ selling simple products cheap. But foreign analysts say Japanese banks are rapidly moving into more sophisticated products, starting to invent as well as copy, and that, combined with first-class skills, their size will be an enormous advantage. `` There could be implications for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if Americans found themselves constrained by their own laws from reaching world size,'' said an American banker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Freeze Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Soybean futures prices jumped about 10 cents a bushel Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that freezing temperatures could strike maturing crops in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as early as next week. Corn and oat futures also finished higher while the wheat market was nearly unchanged. Some private meteorologists say the chance of an early freeze is greater than usual this year, based on weather patterns that caused <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> temperatures to drop to record lows earlier this month. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmerino </PERSON>, a senior agricultural meteorologist with <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his firm sees a 1-in-3 chance of a significant freeze in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during September, compared with the normal odds of 1 in 15. But <PERSON> Palmerino </PERSON> said meteorologists predicting a freeze next week were likely using a forecasting model developed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whereas his firm uses a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> model that suggests rain followed by a warming trend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week. Furthermore, he said, if a freeze were to occur in the Grain Belt next week, `` it would probably affect only a very small portion of the area,'' causing only marginal crop damage. At the close of trading, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.86 a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 2.34 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 1.35 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 10 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 5.88 a bushel.

<HEAD>Apple's Portable Macintosh Will Be Heavy, Expensive And Sharp, Analysts
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s first portable Macintosh will be heavy, bulky and expensive, but it will also have one of the sharpest screens in the business, analysts say. Apple, which plans to announce the new portable Sept. 20, did not cut any corners with its long-awaited portable, even if doing so would have produced a more affordable and easier-to-carry computer, according to people familiar with the product. `` They're trying to be, on one machine, everything to everyone. Which Apple has always done, especially in the Macintosh line,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyeroff </PERSON>, a computer consultant in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, N.Y. The portable Mac is expected to be priced at more than $ 6,000 and weigh about 17 pounds, making it more costly and heavier than the latest IBM-compatible laptop computers. It is powered either by wall current or an internal, rechargeable lead-acid battery. On the plus side, its flat, flip-up screen is expected to be unusually large and sharp, with 1 million picture elements in a 1,000 by 1,000 array. A sharp picture is important because many people use Macintoshes for design work. To overcome the slowness of most flat screens, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> has attached a separate transistor to each picture element, or pixel, so the screen responds almost instantaneously, analysts say. The screen's biggest drawback is that it is somewhat hard to read in dim light, they say Devoted users of the Macintosh for years have seen fellow travelers being able to tap away on their laptop versions of <LOCATION> Tandys </LOCATION>, Zeniths, Toshibas and NECs. Apple has said it was not ready to bring out a portable Mac because the technology for one was not adequate. That apparently has changed. In private showings Apple has been careful not to call the new machine a laptop, which would imply it is lighter than it really is. `` People are calling it the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunyan </PERSON> laptop,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> MacWeek </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a weekly newspaper that has broken information about the forthcoming machine. Laptops are the fastest-growing portion of the personal computer market and have spawned their own smaller offspring, notebook computers, which weigh roughly 4 pounds and slip into an average briefcase. <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to sell a pared-down, lightweight laptop version of the Macintosh is typical of the company's attitude: `` When it comes to design stuff they're rather arrogant. `` My personal feeling is, I'd like <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> to take a look at what <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>'s done with the line of portables they have. That should give them a better idea of what the market's looking for,'' <PERSON> Meyeroff </PERSON> said. Apple declined to respond Thursday to comment and speculation about its machine in advance of the Sept. 20 announcement. Apple wo n't quite have the portable Macintosh market all to itself. Several small companies make fully legal Mac compatibles, billed as add-ons, that are built around circuit boards taken out of actual Mac computers. <ORGANIZATION> Wallaby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, is getting ready to market a portable that weighs less than 10 pounds and costs $ 3,000 or $ 4,000, depending on options. The customer has to take certain circuitry out of an old Macintosh SE or Mac Plus and put it in the Wallaby. The Wallaby can also be hooked to the gutted Mac, giving a user two screens and twice the power. At the upscale end of the market, <ORGANIZATION> Dynamac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> sells a machine with Mac boards that is even more powerful than <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s own portable Mac, with possibly a better screen. But it costs $ 6,000 to $ 10,000, weighs at least as much as the Mac and ca n't run on batteries.

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Crush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> beverage operations to <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British candy and beverage giant, for $ 220 million in cash, the companies announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, a Cincinnati-based consumer products company which operates worldwide, had been searching since May for a buyer for the soft-drink line. The company purchased Crush in 1980 for about $ 50 million and then bought Crush's Canadian operations in 1984 for an estimated $ 10 million. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> said it was selling the Crush unit to devote more time and resources to other beverages, including Folgers coffee, <LOCATION> Citrus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> juices and Sundor fruit juices and drinks. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> had $ 21.4 billion in worldwide sales in the fiscal year ended June 30. P & amp; G's 290 worldwide Crush employees _ about 215 of those are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ will be transferred to other positions within <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, company spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassone </PERSON> said. The cash acquisition would give <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> the Crush brands in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. That unit, which includes the Crush soft drinks and Hires root beer labels, had sales of $ 71 million for the first half of this year. Combining Crush brands with <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s existing drinks businesses would give the company a 4.7 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drinks market, up from 3.6 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> said. Its share of the Canadian market will jump to 15.1 percent from 10.8 percent, it said. Thursday's announcement was accompanied by a report that <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s net income rose 16 percent for the first six months of 1989, to $ 97.8 million from $ 84.5 million. Sales totaled $ 1.86 billion, up 11 percent from $ 1.67 billion in 1988. Last year's results included a one-time gain of $ 47.08 million from the sale of part of <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soft drinks concern Dr. Pepper.

 The stock market moved modestly higher today in sluggish trading as a cautious mood prevailed ahead of sensitive economic reports due Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials managed to eke out a gain after trading near its opening level throughout the day. Wall Street analysts say the market went into a holding pattern before the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues the August unemployment figures which might provide additional evidence that the economy is strong enough not to need the stimulation of lower interest rates. Also scheduled for release Friday are the August survey of purchasing managers and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index of leading economic indicators. A report today that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories sagged 1.7 percent in July to the lowest level in eight months went largely ignored by the market and some analysts said business probably perked up since that month. Airline stocks were an exception to the sluggish activity in the market. Several airline stocks plunged in response to a report that the government may move to curb leveraged buyouts in the industry. The Wall Street Journal reported that a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said in an interview that aviation regulators are concerned about the takeover fever in the airline industry. One of the biggest losers in the airline sector was <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which tumbled 5 to 88 as more than 3.7 million shares changed hands, making it the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s most active issue. The stock recently soared on speculation that it would be a takeover target. Union Carbide, the second most heavily traded NYSE-listed stock, rose 1 -RRB- to 31 -LRB- on word that a securities analyst had upgraded his earnings estimate for the company.

Osceola County Property Appraiser Bob Day removed a lucrative agricultural classification on a large portion of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s property that is suitable for development near Interstate 4 and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 192. Disney's Osceola tax notice, which arrived by mail this week, shows taxes would rise from $ 395,000 in 1988 to more than $ 1.4 million this year. The property, with the exemption, was assessed at $ 26.9 million in 1988. The same parcels were assessed at more than $ 84 million this year. Like many cattle farmers and citrus growers who use the agricultural exemption until it's time to sell or develop, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> had been using exemptions in state laws created by agricultural interests in the late 1950s to reduce its property tax exposure. `` The taxpayers of this county have been subsidizing <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and a lot of speculators for too long,'' Day said Wednesday. `` It's only fair.

 Assets of the nation's 464 money market mutual funds rose $ 53.7 million in the latest week to hit a new record of $ 343.4 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday marked the ninth straight week for a new all-time high in fund assets and followed a $ 2.68 billion increase in the assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. The previous record set the week ended Aug. 23 totaled $ 343.35 billion, revised slightly from the $ 343.22 billion originally reported by the institute. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $ 124.3 million to $ 109.91 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $ 310.3 million to $ 148.16 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds declined $ 380.9 million to $ 85.33 billion.

The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38 days, down from 40 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. Separately, the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 6.46 percent as of Wednesday from 6.45 percent a week earlier.

<TEXT>
 Milk supplies are drying up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, which means consumers probably will have to pay up to 20 cents more per gallon by the end of the year, dairy experts said Thursday. `` It's good news for the dairy farmer because that means his price is going up,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stammer </PERSON>, senior vice president of economics and communications at <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a cooperative of about 2,200 dairy farmers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Milk is really short all the way from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> out to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and clear down through the south,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, director of research at the Farm Credit Banks of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. Agriculture officials said they do n't anticipate a shortage of milk in stores. `` There is milk around, but the cost is going to be increased because they're going to have to go farther and farther west to get the milk,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, assistant commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Dairy farmer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who runs a herd of about 170 on his <ORGANIZATION> Sunderland </ORGANIZATION> farm, said he hopes the shortage will translate into a better price. `` I'm optimistic,'' he said. A few years ago, the nation appeared awash in a milk surplus with the government installing price supports and giving away cheese in bulk amounts. However, there was no overflow in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which produces only about 25 percent of its fluid milk needs. Now, the surplus is gone, partly because of a 1986 `` whole herd buyout,'' in which farmers sold their entire herds to the government for slaughter and promised to stay out of the dairy business for five years. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> imports much of its milk from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which are in the same situation of low production at a time when consumption historically is high, <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the number of dairy farms in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has fallen from about 770 in 1984 to about 450. The buyout program is estimated to have reduced herds by 20 percent while rising land prices and competition from large <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> dairy farms also affected the state industry, officials said. `` The main reason that we're in the current situation is that the dairy farmers' prices pretty much constantly declined since 1983. This has driven a lot of farmers out of business,'' Stammer said. `` Right now, market prices are bidding up the price,'' said <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumb </PERSON>, chief of the order formulation division in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s dairy division. `` It's something that has n't been the case since the late 1970s in terms of dairy prices being market driven,'' he said. The shortage is being felt strongest in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Plumb said. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> has issued permits to bring 100,000 pounds of milk this week into his state as schools order milk for returning children.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which attracted thousands of customers with relatively low credit card interest rate, has bumped the rate by nearly 4 percentage points. `` I feel like I've been sucker-punched,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> energy consultant who said he was drawn to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s low credit card interest rate a year ago. `` That's simply an awesome increase.'' However, the Stockton-based thrift said the increase is necessary to keep its operation competitive. `` We've heard few complaints,'' said American spokeswoman <PERSON> Layna </PERSON> <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Browdy </PERSON> said that more than 50 percent of the bank's customers pay off their credit card balance every month, so they are not affected by the rate hike. The once-insolvent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan, which changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> acquired it last year, boosted its credit card loans eightfold in the past two years by offering <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> holders a relatively low 15 percent interest rate. But last month American raised the rate almost 4 percentage points to 18.9 percent. The increase is retroactive, applying not only to new purchases but also to unpaid balances. `` That seems immoral,'' <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> said. But it is legal. Only a few states, such as <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, have laws prohibiting lenders from applying a new interest rate to an existing balance, and only if the customer stops using the card. If a customer makes a charge after the new rate takes effect, the entire balance is subject to the new rate. American's credit card operation is the second fastest-growing in the state, after <ORGANIZATION> Glendale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>. American's credit card loans jumped to $ 66.4 million by the end of 1988 from $ 8 million in 1986.

 The stock market moved ahead Thursday but a cautious mood prevailed with traders awaiting new reports on economic conditions. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended at its second-highest close ever after trading near its opening level for much of a fairly sluggish session. The industrial average rose 9.12 to 2,737.27, pushed up by a late round of buying.

High-flying airline stocks lost altitude in response to a report that federal regulators soon may move to curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investment in the industry. A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that aviation regulators are concerned about the takeover fever gripping the airline industry.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Move In Opposite Directions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended Aug. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,138.4 billion from a revised $ 3,133.1 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 4.011.0 billion from a revised $ 4,012.2 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 779.6 billion from $ 774.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.9 percent, which is below the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 4.2 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,107.4 billion, a 4 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,990.9 billion, up 3.9 percent, while M1 fell 3.8 percent to an average of $ 774.9 billion.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Up Sharply On Renewed Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices surged in late trading Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange on renewed supply jitters prompted by plans for a strike at a mine in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the world's largest copper producer. On other markets, frost fears sent most grain and soybean futures higher; pork belly futures rose sharply while livestock futures were mixed; precious metals retreated; and energy futures advanced. Copper settled 2.95 cents to 3.35 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1.3195 a pound. Copper miners at the <ORGANIZATION> Chilean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> mine were scheduled to walk out Friday, which would add a fourth major mine to those shut down worldwide by strikes, bankruptcy or terrorism. Copper futures prices generally have been rising over the past month in reaction to the industry's problems. The trend appeared to have changed Tuesday when prices plunged on signs of weakening unity among striking miners in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and some market analysts declared the bull market all but over. Those assumptions may have been premature, despite reports that leaders of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s mining union voted Wednesday to end their 18-day-old strike at midnight Thursday. A walkout at the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> would halt a production stream that produces 120,000 metric tons of refined copper a year, less than 2 percent of the 7-million-ton global output. The <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, a 180,000-ton-a-year unit, has been closed due to terrorist attacks since late July; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Cananea copper mine, with an annual output of 95,000 tons, remains shut down while the government investigates alleged improprieties that led to a bankruptcy declaration last week; and a strike at the <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 170,000-ton-a-year <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> continued for a 57th day Thursday. Talks aimed at ending the <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> strike are scheduled to resume Tuesday, but hopes for a settlement are fading. Soybean futures prices jumped as much as 10 \ cents a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that freezing temperatures could strike maturing crops in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as early as next week <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmerino </PERSON>, a senior agricultural meteorologist with <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his firm sees a 1-in-3 chance of a significant freeze in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> during September, compared to the normal odds of 1 in 15. Soybeans settled 4 cents to 10 \ cents higher with September at $ 5.88 a bushel; wheat was -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 3.86 a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 2.34 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 1.35 a bushel; Frozen pork belly futures rose sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters that a possible package of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including pork bellies, was `` on the front burner. Frozen pork belly futures settled .83 cent to 1.25 cents higher with February at 44 cents a pound; live cattle were .70 cent lower to .25 cent higher with September at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .22 cent higher with August at 83.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .28 cent higher with October at 40.47 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar strengthened. Gold settled $ 1.90 to $ 2.40 lower with September at $ 359.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.5 cents lower with September at $ 5.045 a troy ounce. Energy futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by a weekly <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> report showing substantial drawdowns in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies of gasoline and petroleum distillates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 19 cents higher with September at $ 18.22 a barrel; heating oil was .47 cent to .71 cent higher with September at 53.82 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .02 cent lower to .44 cent higher with September at 54.98 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is buying four new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 jets and has options on four other jets to increase its fleet and replace older aircraft, the company announced Thursday. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> president and chief executive officer, said the $ 250 million deal confirms the airline's confidence in sustained tourism growth in the 1990s. The first of the jets was expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1992. The 737-300 model carries 139 passengers. Aloha currently has two 737-300s in its 13-plane fleet. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said he expects <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s fleet to continue growing at the rate of about one plane a year. He said the airline's oldest jets would be retired as necessary when the new planes arrive. In April 1988, an aging Aloha 737 blew open at 24,000 feet on a flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. A flight attendant was swept to her death. The plane landed on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> missing the front third of its passenger cabin roof.

<HEAD>FCC Approves McCaw's Takeover Of Rival Cellular Phone Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.5 billion hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The commission denied assertions by <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based cellular telephone, broadcasting and publishing concern, that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s bid for transfer of control of LIN's telephone and broadcasting licenses was not in the public interest and that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> did n't have the money to make the deal. LIN also had argued that a hearing should be held to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> held too much control of <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest non-wireline cellular telephone company, under laws limiting foreign investment in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasting companies; that the merger would be anticompetitive; that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would be too indebted; and that the merger would violate cable-television cross-ownership rules. In addition, <PERSON> LIN </PERSON> challenged the character of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> director who is president of the nation's largest cable TV operator, <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it appeared that <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> would not exert direct control over the new company's television operations, but it conditioned its approval on McCaw providing an exact description of <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>'s position and duties and assurances he will comply with the cable-television cross-ownership restrictions. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said `` no good reason has been shown for the commission significantly to depart from its longstanding policy of strict neutrality and hence minimal intervention into the marketplace for corporate control.'' LIN operates seven network-affiliated television stations and has interests in cellular systems serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. It also owns a specialty publishing house that produces hard-cover tourist guides for hotel rooms. In May, LIN's board approved in principal spinning off all of the stock in a new subsidiary that would own its TV stations. It said it would operate its cellular operations along with the publishing business as a separate company. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, Wash.-based <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> made a $ 110-per-share cash offer for all shares of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s stock in July, after first offering $ 120 a share. LIN management is seeking $ 127.50 a share for its 53.9 million shares, or nearly $ 6.9 billion. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> already owns 5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month extended its offer to Sept. 1. About 1.07 million LIN shares have been tendered, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said earlier this month. LIN said on July 31, its own deadline, that its board would pursue other options. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> that, in order to speed the merger, LIN's licenses be transfered temporarily to a trustee representing its wholly owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> MMM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> But the commission said Thursday it could rule on the full application for transfer immediately. The commission said it generally does not consider debt or the level of debt as a relevant consideration in license transfers. As for assertions by LIN that <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> has n't lined up the financing necessary, the commission said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> had `` well in excess of the amount needed to acquire LIN, with the balance more than adequate to operate the -LRB- LIN -RRB- television stations for three months.'' The commission said <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> had $ 1 billion in cash from the recent sale of stock to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, the British phone company; $ 1.3 billion in revolving credit; $ 2 billion from a credit line from a bank syndicate headed by <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION>; and up to $ 2.5 billion from public or private equity or debt placements to be managed by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s 22 percent holdings in McCaw were within the 25 percent limits for foreign investors. The British government has a 48 percent ownership interest in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also rejected LIN's request to look into possible anticompetitive rule violations by <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, the regional telephone company, which would be partnered with <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> through the merger, while competing with <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> in other areas. It also said no further action was warranted on LIN's assertions that <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> was not qualified to hold licenses because of his possible involvement in a cable franchise renewal proceeding in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, that resulted in a multimillion-dollar verdict against <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION> for antitrust violations. LIN's TV stations are: <ORGANIZATION> KXAS </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-Dallas </LOCATION>; WISH, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; WOTV, <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; WAVY, <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> KXAN </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; WAND in central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; and WANE, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened higher against the Japanese yen in early trading Friday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> also gained. The dollar started trading at 144.95 yen, up 0.67 yen from Thursday's close. It finished at 145.03 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, up 0.80 yen from the previous day. <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Seto </PERSON>, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said trust banks purchased dollars soon after the market opened following a dollar-buying trend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, rumors on the market that a major life insurance company was waiting to sell a large amount of dollars exerted downward pressure on the dollar, <PERSON> Seto </PERSON> said. He said dealers were also waiting the announcement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate in August, due for release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> later Friday. But their long-term position adjustments would have more of an impact on the market than the jobless rate, he added. The 225-issue Nikkei Industrial Average rose 40.07 points, or 0.12 percent, to 34,471.27 shortly after the market opened.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against Regulations in Stock Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a lower court's decision to throw out controversial first-in-the-nation state regulations that would have made it easier for stock traders to sue brokers in financial disputes. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> backed up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON>'s December 1988 ruling throwing out <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> regulations that prevent stockbrokers from requiring customers to seek arbitration in stock disputes. A coalition of brokers brought the case in September 1988 after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> imposed the regulations, inspired by the 1987 stock market crash. The regulations would have required brokers to fully disclose the terms of their arbitration agreements and give customers the option of maintaining their right to sue in court. `` We can find no evidence of a clear congressional command to override the unambiguous pro-arbitration mandate of the -LRB- Federal Arbitration Act -RRB- in the securities field,'' the court opinion said. Other states interested in instituting requirements similar to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> regulations were watching the case closely. Typically, the arbitration agreements state that in the event of a dispute, the customer and the broker would go into arbitration before a mutually acceptable party, such as the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, rather than take the case to court. Among those challenging the regulations were the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and 10 brokerage firms, including <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokerage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of investors filed complaints alleging their urgent stock transactions were misplaced or mishandled during the stock market crash of October 1987 and many have said they prefer lawsuits to arbitration `` There's been a certain amount of suspicion that investors do n't get as good a result in arbitration as in court,'' said attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>, who represents the plaintiffs in the case `` But as far as I'm concerned that's unfounded.'' Telephone calls placed to <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>'s office for comment Thursday evening were not answered.

<HEAD>SBA To Buy Data Network From US Sprint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Small Business Administration has signed a letter of intent for data network services to be provided through the government's new FTS2000 long-distance network, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint said Thursday. Sprint said the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> will be the first customer <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> will provide with new integrated voice and data services through FTS2000. Sprint said the contract could be worth $ 7 million over 10 years. Sprint is providing 40 percent of FTS2000, while a team led by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will provide the other 60 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says FTS2000 could be worth as much as $ 10 billion to the companies that will provide voice, video and computer data to more than 1,300 far-flung government agencies. The <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> network will handle transactions the agency sends between its 10 regional centers nationwide and more than 100 field offices, <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> said. Sprint said the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the new system would save taxpayers at least $ 300,000 over five years. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T announced two weeks ago that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will be the first agency to use AT & amp; T's portion of the new data network services. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said the <ORGANIZATION> HFCA </ORGANIZATION> contract was worth $ 100 million.
