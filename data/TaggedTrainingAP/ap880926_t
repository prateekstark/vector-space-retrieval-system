 Lehrer: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a question for the vice president. Jennings: Mr. Vice President, I'm struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life and it leads me to recall your own phrase that you are `` haunted'' by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling, there's an explosion of single-parent families, and by any measure these single-parent families _ many with unwanted children _ are the source of poverty, school dropouts, crime which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: One of the reasons _ and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about and then we could talk on the merits of the programs _ but you see my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to the haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid to challenge the states and maybe, maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, so much of it is _ gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in. And that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education. I think part of it is the crime-infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat _ the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so, it's a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light, the people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing so people can learn to read in this country, and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I'm for Head Start, moving that up, and I've already made a proposal. And yes, it'll cost some money, but I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I do n't think the federal government can endorse a $ 35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program. Q. Governor? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, I must have been living through a different eight years from the one that the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. It's cut federal aid to education; it has cut <ORGANIZATION> Pell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grants </ORGANIZATION> and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people _ hundreds of thousands of people _ living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting. Now, that's the way you help people. Being haunted _ `` a thousand points of light'' _ I do n't know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.

 Jennings: Governor, the crisis is no less a crisis for you if you were elected president. Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities, which is clearly needed? And can you be specific about the programs not only you'd reinstate, but the more imaginative ones that you'd begin? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, I said a few minutes ago, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids do n't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help, literally, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of families to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives _ the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time. In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they may lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> who has to tell his youngster that he ca n't play <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> ball, that he ca n't go out on that ball field, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt And, yet, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` Well, I do n't think we ought to expect businesses to provide health insurance for their employees.'' When responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not employed, that are not insured that have to go to that hospital. So, these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives and more decent lives. And we're ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us I know the private sector is. People are all over the country. But, it takes presidential leadership. It takes a commitment to being involved and to leading. And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.

 Union officials and <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> authorities reached a tentative contract settlement Sunday on the eve of a threatened strike that would affect about 100,000 commuters on the 71-mile train line. `` Both sides compromised and compromised, and then we met _ sort of happily _ in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 790. Union negotiators and <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> officials held face-to-face talks throughout the weekend with a state mediator before a settlement was reached late Sunday afternoon. The agreement was announced at a joint news conference Sunday evening. A ratification vote is set for Wednesday, and Local 790 President <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waalkens </PERSON> predicted approval. `` I think they will be as happy as they can be with what we've gotten,'' he said Details of the tentative settlement were not released. A strike had been called for Monday morning after 1,200 janitors, maintenance workers and clerks rejected a contract offer last week. As negotiations took place Sunday, agency managers were being trained in operations of the train system, <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouber </PERSON> said. A wildcat strike threatened for Sunday by union representatives angry about the training did not materialize, <PERSON> Mouber </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> hoped the training would enable it to operate about half its normal service Monday with the use of 42 management employees. Another union, which represents 500 station agents and train operators had agreed to a contract with <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> but promised to honor Local 790's picket lines. Those lines had been scheduled to form at 6 a.m. Monday at 34 stations. The disputed contract proposals involved profits from retirement fund investments, union activity during work hours, sick leave restrictions and overtime.

 Lehrer: Mr. Vice President. Bush: What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a `` thousand points of light'' and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he does n't understand what I'm talking about And this is the problem I have with the big-spending liberals. They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all. The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government. It is up, it is not down. The federal, but here's the point he misses, the federal government spends 7 percent of the total money on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments, and the `` thousand points of light'' _ and I'm talking about private schools, and private church schools, and things of this nature _ are putting up 93 percent. But the federal spending for education is up. And I want to be the `` education president,'' because I want to see us do better. We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. We've gotten away from the values and the fundamentals, and I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path toward real excellence. And we can do it, but it's not going to be dictated by some federal bureaucracy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Lehrer: All right. Let's move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> will ask the first question of the governor. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>: Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters. He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons systems that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country. Is that true? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Of course not. Of course, that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> back in 1980. Remember that, <PERSON> George </PERSON>? And yet, some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors: <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. It's not the amount of time you've spent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, it's not the length of your resume. It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick, it's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised to outline his view of what lies ahead for the world as he went before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today for his seventh appearance and his last before leaving office. Asked as he returned from a weekend at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Sunday whether he was looking forward to his annual visit for the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the president answered with a single word: `` Yes.'' An official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said over the weekend that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would deal in his speech with the thorny issue of chemical weapons, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many other Western nations manufacture. The president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, predicted last week that the president also would press efforts to stem the proliferation of such weapons in individual talks with world leaders. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has addressed the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> each year since 1983. He also spoke at a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament in 1982. In his weekly radio speech Saturday, the president said he would talk today about his administration's record of `` successes for our philosophy of peace through strength.'' `` The great question now is, what next?'' he added. `` Where does the world go in the next eight years and the next 80 years? What are the steps we might take toward a safer, better, freer world? And I'll have some thoughts of my own on Monday.'' `` One thing is certain,'' he said. ` If we're to continue to advance world peace and human freedom, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must remain strong. We must turn a deaf ear to those born-again patriots who talk about strength while serving up the same old menu of weakness.'' The president did n't say whom he was talking about, but the words were similar to those he has used to describe the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After his speech, the president planned to meet with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>; with senior advisers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>; with Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> and Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>; with President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>; with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>; and with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Persian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` committed to a comprehensive, worldwide ban on chemical weapons'' and he expected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to `` press the issue'' in his talks. Both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in their eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. In addition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using poison gas against its Kurdish minority. It will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was releasing $ 188 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld from the organization to show displeasure with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budgetary and hiring practices. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had responded to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestions by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as the fact that the organization `` has started to play a more important role around the world in helping to deal with regional conflicts.''

 When <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> sent a team of scientists to <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in 1865, he expected them to return to the Smithsonian Institution with samples of birds, animals and Eskimo artifacts. They brought back all that, as well as evidence of mineral wealth that helped persuade a reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two years later to spend $ 7.2 million to buy <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from the Russian czar. `` Seward's Folly'' it was called, after <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, who was then secretary of state Many of the samples collected in those and later expeditions, including some native American hunting cloaks of astounding beauty, have gone on display at a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibit that also features samples collected by 18th century Russian pioneers but never before shown. The exhibit is at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s Museum of Natural History. `` This is a story that no one country can tell,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON>, curator of the show, which is the fruit of a decade of planning and cooperation between American and Soviet anthropologists. The exhibit, `` Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' also highlights recent scientific findings about the migration of people across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> 11,000 years to 12,000 years ago and the development of native American culture in the far Northwest. And now, 121 years after <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was sold for a song, Russian scholars flocked to the <LOCATION> Smithsonian </LOCATION> last week for a series of seminars on the links between ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the Eskimo, Aleut, Athapaskan, <ORGANIZATION> Eyak </ORGANIZATION> and Tlingit peoples of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` So we learn that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> played a leading role in convincing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 19th century to buy <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Potemkin </PERSON>, cultural attache at the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It is the same Smithsonian Institution that is playing a leading role in bringing the neighbors together again,'' he said. The exhibition, part of increased cultural cooperation between the superpowers, breaks new ground in several respects. It provides Western scholars with their first look at examples of Eskimo and Tlingit art collected for the czars by explorers like <PERSON> Vitus </PERSON> <PERSON> Bering </PERSON>, and by scientists and Russian traders who settled as far south as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Many of the objects have been stored out of public sight in the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, the oldest museum in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, founded in what is now <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great in 1714. In another first, after the exhibition tours the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with stops in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, it will go to <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and then to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and two Soviet cities yet to be chosen. The rich collection of clothes, hunting devices and other utensils on display testify to the links between the native cultures of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and also the differences. Many of the Siberian peoples, said <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON>, learned to raise herds of reindeer. That form of life involves a more complex social structure than that of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> peoples, who remained largely hunter-gatherers. `` The hunters had a spiritual relation with the animals that were their prey,'' said <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON>. And when they hunted, they wore their best clothes, including one elaborate cloak sewn of gut and decorated with cormorant feathers, <PERSON> Fitzhugh </PERSON>'s favorite object in the exhibit.

 The Metropolitan Opera's 105th season may be opening with something of a musical whimper, but it promises to end with a bang. The gold curtain will rise tonight on a production of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Il Trovatore'' that, when it premiered last season, provoked some of the most scathing critical catcalls in recent memory When the season ends in May, it will be with a musical event of historic proportions _ three performances of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s four-opera Ring Cycle, not seen in its entirety at the Met for a generation. In between are a number of promising evenings _ starting with the second night of the season when <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s `` Giulio Cesare'' will be presented at the Met for the first time. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyanos </PERSON> will star, along with <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gall </PERSON>, the first countertenor ever to sing at the Met. The Handel masterpiece will be conducted by <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON>, the British early music specialist who not only has never conducted at the Met before but has never conducted any opera before. He will be leading an orchestra of about 30 players, unusually small for the Met pit. By contrast, there is little new or unusual about `` Il Trovatore.'' Met artistic director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> will conduct an all-star cast that includes <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milnes </PERSON>, but whether they can overcome the dreary staging remains to be seen. `` Normally it takes a new opera production years to decline to the point of terminal weariness and ineptitude, but the Metropolitan Opera's ` Trovatore' reached that sad state in one evening,'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> chief music critic <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> Henahan </PERSON> wrote after the premiere last fall. Of <LOCATION> Fabrizio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Melano </LOCATION>'s production, <PERSON> Henahan </PERSON> said, `` The idea that anyone actually directed the solo singers or the chorus strained belief.'' <PERSON> Ezio </PERSON> <PERSON> Frigerio </PERSON>'s sets, he wrote, `` consisted mostly of six groups of marbleized pillars that moved about for reasons known perhaps only to the designer.'' Despite this and other pans, most upcoming performances of `` Trovatore'' have been sold out for weeks. That includes opening night, when tickets cost up to $ 1,000, a price that entitles the holder to attend a post-opera party. Total gross revenues from the evening will come to $ 629,000. `` Gradually, we're making opening night into the gala social event it was 25 years ago,'' explained Met spokeswoman <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>. `` If you approach it that way, then it makes sense to do something like <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON> that is popular with the kind of audience that goes to galas.'' A key ingredient of success for such a gala seems to be the presence of either <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> or the world's other leading operatic tenor, <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>. One or the other has starred in five out of the last six opening nights, and <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> will be on hand when the Met puts on another gala in December _ a new production of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Aida. The three Ring Cycles that will climax the season represent the fulfillment of a longtime dream for <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, restoring to the repertory for the first time since the early 1970s one of the crowning works of opera. The production by <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenk </PERSON> has sets and projections by <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider-Siemssen </PERSON> that combine an old-fashioned literalism with modern technology. The cast, led by <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Behrens </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bruennhilde </PERSON>, is about the best available in today's impoverished world of Wagnerian singing.

Sucurre is an Old French word meaning `` to assist.'' `` Can you imagine being 30, 40 or 50 years old and having to wait for someone to read a stack of Christmas cards to you? Or not being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for your wife or a birthday card for your child?'' she asked. The inspiration for Sucurre Greetings, which Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> owns with her husband, came while she was working on an advertising project with a blind businessman. `` He was doing things I could n't do even with my sight,'' she said. `` It just did n't seem right that he needed someone to go to a store with him just to pick out a card.'' Because of the limited market, Braille greeting cards have not been manufactured by established card companies, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ash </PERSON>, publisher of the Gift Reporter, a trade publication for the gift industry. Some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some Braille cards at Christmas, and others translate greeting cards to Braille when requested. `` At best, what you've been able to get up until now is a card for a sighted person that's been Brailled. These cards are designed specifically for a visually impaired person, but are still appealing to a sighted person as well,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponchillia </PERSON>, a professor in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ponchillia </PERSON>, who is blind, helped the Shanks design the cards. The Shanks, also co-owners of a year-old advertising and printing company, hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide audience. Underneath the design is a description of the object in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION>. Inside, Braille appears under the message, typically a short phrase with slightly raised letters. One lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover. Inside, the message is `` My heart's all a-flutter.'' In addition to her basic line of 25 cards, Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said she also has a line of Christmas cards. `` We want the person to get the full impact of the card _ a card that everyone can enjoy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, a bubbly, 32-year-old mother of three. She does the embossing by hand. Her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, art director at a television station, does much of the designing and printing. Most of the Brailling is done by blind volunteers. Distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops, but Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up distributors for the cards in other parts of the country. The cards sell for $ 2 and $ 2.50 locally. If the cards catch on, the <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> would like to provide jobs for blind rehabilitation and training groups. And it looks as if the cards may be catching on. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of department stores, as well as an alphabet book Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> designed for use by both sighted and blind children. `` Before getting involved in this, I never really knew a blind person and I do n't think I ever remember seeing a book that's shown me what <PERSON> Braille </PERSON>'s like,'' she said. `` We planned the book to get rid of the gap between sighted and blind children. We want a sighted child to know what Braille feels like and a blind child to be able to feel the letters that we're seeing Maybe that way we can get rid of some of the prejudice.'' Prejudice is a subject Mrs. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> knows well. `` Because I'm black, some people might ask why I'm not doing something for a black cause. Well, blindness knows no color. When people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped people, maybe they'll stop being prejudiced about black people,'' she said.

 As Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> lies in his sickbed, a lack of information and conflicting reports on his health are provoking frustration and concern. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s stubborn reluctance to release detailed information about the monarch is drawing increasingly strong criticism. `` I am getting the strong impression that the emperor's real condition may be much worse than what's been reported,'' said <PERSON> Naoki </PERSON> <PERSON> Inose </PERSON>, author of several books on the imperial family. `` Only a handful of doctors, nurses and servants actually get to see the emperor other than those in the imperial family.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which handles all matters concerning the monarchy, has been releasing only the emperor's temperature, blood pressure and pulse three to four times a day along with a brief comment about his condition `` What we are interested in is how the emperor is really doing, not those medical numbers,'' said a middle-aged man who came to the palace Sunday to sign his name in a registry of well-wishers. `` His condition is everyone's interest.'' A reporter for a nationally circulated newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had its `` own standards about the news, which apparently differ considerably from today's ordinary standard.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second largest circulation newspaper, said Saturday that the emperor apparently has cancer. It quoted pathologists who examined tissue taken from the emperor's pancreas when he underwent intestinal bypass surgery last September as saying `` cancer cells were found in the tissue.'' The article said pathologists at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> believe the emperor has either pancreatic or duodenum cancer and that palace officials decided he should not be told about it. Instead, the article said, they announced the illness as merely an inflammation of the pancreas. <PERSON> Shouichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimori </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, telephoned the publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, expressed regret and asked the newspaper to exercise self-restraint. `` At this point where the emperor's consciousness is still clear and he is struggling with his illness, publishing the article was deemed totally inappropriate,'' said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Taking into account the emperor's feeling, the decision to publish such an article apparently lacks consideration. But he refused to confirm or deny the report, saying only: `` Matters regarding the fact of the article and publishing such an article are on different dimensions.'' Deputy Managing Editor <PERSON> Hisao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuwashima </PERSON> said the paper printed the article after its editors decided the emperor would not be able to read a newspaper again. `` Everyone is frustrated about the lack of information about his condition,'' said <PERSON> Kuwashima </PERSON>. `` His conditions have been clearly showing signs of pancreatic cancer since a long time ago. After he was listed in critical condition, we decided we must run this article.'' He said the decision also was based on the fact that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is a public figure. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the decision whether to tell patients they have cancer is left to doctors and relatives. When <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature soared Saturday afternoon, some news services and television stations quoted unidentified government sources as saying the emperor was in critical condition, was hooked to a respirator and was receiving heart massages. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> hastily denied those reports and angrily said: `` Which can you trust, speculation by unknown soruces or us?'' The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Secrecy is an important part of the imperial family,'' said <PERSON> Inose </PERSON>. `` If an imperial family gave away all secrets and everything became open, they would not be able to maintain the implicit authority they have now. `` For the people surrounding the imperial family, what's good for the emperor always comes before what's good for people, and that's been taken for granted for centuries,'' <PERSON> Inose </PERSON> said.

 The Olympic stadiums where athletes from 160 nations are competing overlook another battlefield, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were locked in ferocious combat 38 years ago today. It is the anniversary of the Sept. 26, 1950 capture of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> forces from communist North Korean troops _ three months after the beginning of the Korean War. About 4 million soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded in the war. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and almost every other city on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> was badly damaged in the bitter ideological clash. `` Starting in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> I finally found out there is no glory in war. It's cruel, miserable, dirty and nothing worth bragging about,'' said former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in an interview. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has been rebuilt and is now a sprawling, modern metropolis of 10 million people. The city's skyscrapers and broad avenues are a monument to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s astonishing growth since the war. But the scene was very different in 1950 when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other nations intervened under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> command to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after it was invaded on June 25 by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s ill-equipped and poorly trained army was knocked back and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> captured within a few days of the invasion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that rushed into <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were pushed back with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> army until they held the southwestern tip of the peninsula around the port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. Bloody battles raged through August 1950 as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> attempted to break through the <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> perimeter. The war took a dramatic turn Sept. 15, 1950 when Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> outflanked the North Koreans with an amphibious assault at <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> next to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and far behind communist lines. MacArthur's gamble paid off and within days <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and some South Korean forces reached the south bank of the <LOCATION> Han </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, including the area around where the Olympic Park is now. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rushed 10,000 reinforcements into <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the northern bank of the Han was bristling with tanks and artillery that could fire straight into any assault across the river. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders on the spot wanted to advance slowly and outflank the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. But MacArthur's headquarters in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> ordered <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> retaken by Sept. 25, exactly three months after the communist invasion. American ground commanders were forced to attack across the Han in the face of deadly <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> gunfire, according to historical accounts. All of the bridges had been destroyed and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops went across in barges and boats. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Saluzzi </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine who took part in the attack, saw dead bodies for the first time when he arrived on the banks of the Han. `` We were assembled near an area covered with litters of dead Marines ... I was afraid to look but eventually forced myself to. Only hours before those Marines had been joking and telling sea stories,'' he said in an interview. `` I saw myself covered by one of those blankets and remember thinking, ` When it comes, let it be quick and without pain.''' Much of the city was burned and destroyed by massive artillery and air attacks before the assault. Entire streets were demolished by cannon fire and fires swept unchecked across the ancient capital. Once the troops got across the Han, they found the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> ready to fight for every house and street. Units battled their way across <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, dislodging communist troops who would not surrender. `` It seemed that every building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> housed an enemy sniper. We cleaned out doorways and rooftops; we went from street to street, house to house,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> sergeant <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergee </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> were furious when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military headquarters announced the city was retaken Sept. 25, according to historical accounts, because the main attack did not begin until early Sept. 26 and there was scattered fighting until Sept. 28. <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Syngman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON> arrived Sept. 28 for a ceremony at the National Capitol to mark the return of the city to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Rhee </PERSON> said to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander, `` We love you as the savior of our race.'' <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> would fall again in January 1951 after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> intervened in the war in November and pushed back the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces _ and later be recaptured by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces and held until the war finally ended in stalemate in 1953.

 Chinese who live abroad and wish to be buried in the motherland can now buy a plot under a grave-marketing venture by <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> companies, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The joint venture is offering 2,000 `` tombs'' on a hillside 12 miles from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, with a 50-square-foot site costing $ 2,050, the agency said. People wishing a more prominent post-life return to the mainland will be able to put up personal statues, and the plots come in a variety of styles to meet the needs of people of different religions, the report said. The project is a joint venture between the <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> -RRB- Funeral and <ORGANIZATION> Interment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> interment service company. <PERSON> Xinhua </PERSON> did not specify whether those buying the sites would follow Chinese custom and be cremated before being put to rest. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government has tried to make cremation a universal practice in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of the country's severe land shortage, but has met some resistance in rural areas where people are traditionally buried.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: a mistake?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, if this is Christmas, I hope it's Christmas when you make that decision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: These are the, these are the, these are the _ my answer is: do not make these unilateral cuts. And everybody now realizes that peace through strength works. And so this is where I have a big difference. Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on conventional forces. But now, we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies. We will do what we do best. It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years. It is going to take us to a much better advantage in conventional forces. But look, let me sum it up. I want to be the president that gets conventional forces in balance. I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start, and I think I've had that. Lehrer: Governor? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, first, let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be a subject of partisan demagoguery, because it was too important to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or for the world. I did n't hear, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do, but I know this. We have serious financial problems in this country. We've piled up over $ 1 trillion in debt, and the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to have to make some choices. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we do n't need and ca n't afford. I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. But those are the choices the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to have to make. I am for the Stealth, I am for the D-5, I am for going ahead with the advanced cruise missile. But I do n't think we need these other systems. I do n't think we need them to remain strong. We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test-ban treaty, and _ Lehrer: Governor? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: _ with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with deeper cuts on the Soviet side. And Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I will pursue that policy. Lehrer: <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON>, a question for the vice president. Groer: Well, Mr. Vice President, you said you met with Secretary General <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, you have met with Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. But for the last 40 years, Americans have been taught to regard the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the enemy. Yet, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed two arms control treaties, and he's promised to share Star Wars technology with the very country he once called the `` evil empire.'' So, perhaps you could tell us this evening, should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open, be cautious, because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them, but I do n't want to see us exporting our highly-sensitive national security oriented technology to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> I do n't want to see us making unilateral cuts in our strategic systems while we are negotiating with them. And so I'm encouraged by what I see when I talk to Mr., what I hear when I talk to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. But can they pull it off? And when they have deals that are good for us as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> started to do _ the changes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I lived there is absolutely amazing in terms of incentive and partnerships and things of this nature. And now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seems to be walking down that same path. We should encourage that. We ought to say this is good. But where I differ with my opponent is, I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defense systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.

<HEAD>No ``Smoking Gun'', But Charges Still Tarnish Aquino Government
Luster</HEAD>

 Corruption charges are tarnishing the image of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government, even though no one has produced evidence she is sanctioning practices that led to the downfall of her predecessor, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. For months, <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers have been replete with allegations of official corruption. They include `` disappearing'' food stocks, rake-offs from state-run companies, bribery in the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and shakedowns by crooked policemen. Last week, retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, who was appointed security chief at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport to clean up corruption there, quit in disgust, saying he was powerless to root out `` institutionalized graft.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s personal integrity remains unquestioned. But critics allege some of her relatives used their connections to enhance their wealth in questionable business deals. In August, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> quit as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government, citing interference by relatives of `` powers that be'' in efforts to retrieve the billions of dollars <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates allegedly embezzled during his 20-year administration. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in February 1986 after he was ousted in civilian-military uprising that placed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in power. Few of the recent allegations against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> have been proven, and so far no senior official has gone to jail. Many of the charges have been leveled by self-serving opposition politicians seeking to find an issue with which to embarrass the president. Last week, opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> admitted he was wrong in claiming Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, had secretly assumed the chairmanship of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which was taken over by the government because of its links to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Nonetheless, political commentators believe the sheer volume of the charges has sullied the reputation of an administration which came to power promising to clean up government after rampant corruption under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. At best, the charges point to widespread inefficiency, incompetence and mismanagement in the bureaucracy. In some cases, government investigators acknowledged widespread irregularities in state agencies but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has vowed to stamp out corruption but demands proof before she will crack down on alleged offenders. She has said frequently that most of the allegations have been raised by her enemies to undermine her personally. But some analysts believe strong measures are necessary because of public sensitivity after years of blatant, state-sanctioned corruption under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` The president must start giving her people some big fish to fry,'' said the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` Otherwise, they will set their hooks elsewhere. And the blood will spatter not just the walls of bureaucray but on the foundations of our new democracy as well.'' Some analysts believe Filipinos are quick to accept corruption allegations _ regardless of proof _ because many see examples of petty graft every day. These include policemen who shake down motorists for bribes to ignore traffic violations to bureaucrats who accept `` tips'' to speed processing of licenses and other official documents. Vast timberlands are being systematically denuded of trees by illegal logging operations. It is widely assumed such operations continue under the protection of corrupt military officers. Impatience with high-level corruption has also been heightened because millions of Filipinos must struggle daily simply to earn enough to feed, clothe and shelter themselves and their families. Coupled with that is the continuing failure of the government to improve the economic livelihood of millions, especially those who live in the impoverished countryside. `` There is a strong perception here that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is personally honest,'' said Most Rev. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Legaspi </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Naga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, located about 190 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` But people do not see goodness translated into something that is effective.''

 Rising out of the azure waters like the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> god of wind, Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> smashed idyllic resorts and industrial cities during an eight-day rampage across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on Sept. 10, 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, sending the first waves of torrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. By the time <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> lost its hurricane status over northeastern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, it had killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s trail of destruction across nine nations occurred despite the technological advances of modern-day weather forecasting. Airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane several times daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storm's next target `` It was one of the top 10 as far as intensity, size and destructive potential,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. After leaving more than eight dead in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> punished <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s capital <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and the resort of <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, then pushed northwestward past the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, which needs tourism for much of its hard currency, sustained $ 8 billion in damage and at least 30 people died. <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> lost much of its drinking water, electricity and many services. A half-million people, nearly one-fourth the island population, were left homeless. Luckiest perhaps was the low-lying three-island British colony called the <ORGANIZATION> Caymans </ORGANIZATION>, which suffered remarkably little damage. `` All 23,000 people of the islands got on their knees and said ` Thank You,''' journalist <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Winker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> moved into the Yucatan Channel between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, gathering strength over warm waters to become a Category 5 storm or `` great hurricane'' with winds of up to 160 mph. The Caribbean Indians called their god of wind Huracan, and the winds of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> were terrifyingly strong, up to 218 mph at one point as it neared <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Rain spread more than 400 miles from north to south. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s tail dumped up to 10 inches of rain in portions of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, leaving more than 15 dead in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> Next struck was <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, a 110-hotel Mexican island resort off the Yucatan that was built in the 1970s after computer studies showed it would be rarely hit by hurricanes. Said tourist <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>: `` The wind came in the bedroom one way and went out the other and took everything with it.'' In one <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> hotel, where 450 were packed into a banquet room, refugees had to hold up a wall against the strong winds. There was no water. Toilets, in some cases one to a shelter, could not be flushed. `` We do not know what it is to be dirty ... sharing bathrooms that do n't work. We are not used to it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> said of the American and Canadian tourists caught by the storm. `` Some people handle it graciously and some do n't.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> uprooted palms, Indian laurels and other trees and snapped antenna support cables in the nearby resorts of <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mujeres </LOCATION>. Electrical poles fell, breaking power lines. Thatched huts and wooden structures collapsed. After the storm, a 118-foot Cuban fishing boat was found tossed up beside a beach hotel, dramatic proof of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s strength. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> caused more than $ 300 million in damage to the tourist industry of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>. In nearby <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, it destroyed nearly all the corn and fruit crops. At least 24 died in the area. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> next moved into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, threatening oil drilling installations and populated areas from <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, before moving over land in the state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Ocean waters more than three feet deep pushed several miles inland over the barren flats. At least 11 villagers drowned along the coast. But the worst lay ahead. About 160 miles northwest was <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> and its 2.8 million people. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> collided with the 14,000-foot-high mountains around <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, creating killing torrents with a load of rain that swept away passenger buses traveling along the normally dry bed of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. More than 200 died Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> alone, the biggest single toll from the storm. In recent years the state government had used the riverbed as a thoroughfare, for electricity towers and for miles of fields for baseball and soccer. `` The water was kind of running through,'' said witness <PERSON> Cosme </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibay </PERSON>. `` Then all of a sudden, it came, bam, all at once. I have never seen anything like it in my life.'' Two Americans also died from Gilbert-spawned tornadoes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but the dying rains did some good, filling dams near the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border and bringing an abrupt end to a long summer drought.

 The emergence of rival Christian and Moslem governments threatens to plunge <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> once again into a civil war fueled by outside powers that long have used the country as a proxy battlefield. The crisis could formalize the de facto partition of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into sectarian cantons carved out during the 13-year civil war, which killed about 150,000 people. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the major power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, backs the Moslem government and the Shiite Moslem Amal militia. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> support the right-wing Christians. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> funds the Druse militia, which sent volunteers to fight alongside Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s army in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms and bankrolls the Shiite fundamentalists. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> helps the Sunni Moslems, but fundamentalist <PERSON> Sunnis </PERSON> also look to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for support. The Christians and Moslems each are split by internal rivalries. The Maronite Catholics, the dominant Christian sect, are patronized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Greek Orthodox, traditionally more leftist, are pro-Syrian. The failure of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, when his six-year term expired Thursday spawned competing Christian and Moslem governments. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as prime minister. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> backs Sunni Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who took office in June 1987. At best, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> was little more than a figurehead. He had no control of Moslem-held areas, and even in the shrunken Christian enclave the real power was the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> forces, the Christians' main militia The 42,000-man army is fractured, with some units backing <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> or allied with the Lebanese Forces. Shiite and Druse Moslem brigades have either sat on the sidelines or actively backed Moslem militias. The cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> also have significantly affected the region. Particularly important is the intensification of the long feud between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which backed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are ruled by rival wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been weakened by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s apparent military collapse, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has stepped up its propaganda campaign against <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also fears it could be eclipsed as a key player in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute by the support the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has gained from the uprising. Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> looked to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to provide him with a success by restoring stability to the divided country through the election of one of its allies as president. The Syrians, with 40,000 troops in north and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector, consider their tiny western neighbor vital to their security. The cease-fire freed the Iraqis to take revenge on <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for siding with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by confronting the Syrians' ambitions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and stirring trouble for them in their own backyard. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, influential in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> moved in in 1976 seeking to quell the civil war, has provided weapons and ammunition to the right-wing Lebanese Christian forces opposed to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Arab diplomats said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, which long has had links with the Lebanese Forces, recently shipped 50 armored personnel carriers to the Christian militia. It was the Lebanese Forces' fierce opposition to Syrian-backed candidates in the presidential election that foiled <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' efforts to secure political reforms that would give <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem majority an equal share of constitutional power with the long-dominant <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s claim that it defeated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, justified to some extent by its military victories, pushed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to seek to impose greater control over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and prevent any <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> intervention. The Iraqis also support <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is feuding with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. The Syrians also have to contend with Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem fundamentalists, who seek to create the world's second Islamic Republic in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Shiite ally, the Amal militia, sought to crush the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, this year. When <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, aided by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, came out on top, the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> intervened to corral <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in its stronghold in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s slums The fundamentalists, quiet for the moment, remain a threat to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s efforts to control <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In the tense capital of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s backward region of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the majority Albanians and minority Slavs are divided from the cradle to the grave It starts in kindergarten, where parents say Albanian and Slav children trade racial slurs. It ends with the death notices on trees lining main streets _ black borders for Slavs, green for Albanians. In good times, there was some fraternization, even intermarriage, among the Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 2 million people, and the 200,000 Slavs. But the closeness is increasingly rare since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine dead and 200 injured. In the past months, the tension has increased in this region the Slavs see as their historic homeland. The Albanians, most of whom are Moslems, want to win a greater voice in governing <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, now administered by the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The Slavs are pushing to absorb the autonomous province into <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. For the mostly <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavs </PERSON>, made up of Serbs and Montenegrins, the Albanian demand is impossible. They argue that a separate republic would oust them from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> was settled by Serbs in the 7th century and was the heart of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s medieval empire. The Turks conquered it in 1389 and ruled until the Balkan War of 1913, when it was partitioned between <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and what is now the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Albanians, believed to be descended from the ancient Illyrians, have been in the region since ancient times. Slavs say the Albanians would precipitate the breakup of this communist <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> country by seceding and uniting with <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, the neighboring communist country. Thousands of Serbs and Montenegrins have left <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> because of arson and other attacks they blame on the Albanians, who are rarely given a chance to publicly respond to what appear to be grossly distorted accounts. The animosity, exacerbated by emotional Slav rallies protesting alleged Albanian attacks, is now so high that many residents believe a military crackdown will come within months, or even weeks. Police equipped with armored personnel carriers have been sent to the province by the federal government in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The Slavs say <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Albanians, who have the highest birthrate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, are making a conscious effort to outbreed them. They claim the Albanians are chasing them out of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> by attacking their women and children and offering irresistibly high amounts of money for their properties. `` You could buy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for what they pay here,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> resident of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He cited prices of $ 222,000 for a house in the hilly city. The Slavs have found a champion for their cause in <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who advocates more direct Serbian control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and the autonomous province of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, near the Hungarian border. Both areas control their own judiciary, police and other insitutions. The position of the <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has thrown <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> into its most explosive political crisis of the postwar era. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s views have drawn hundreds of emotional crowds to rallies where they vent their frustrations with <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic crisis by chanting for arms and vowing to keep <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Slavic `` We are shaking the country,'' said <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Solevic </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> Serb who heads a committee to organize the rallies. But leaders of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s other republics say <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s emotional tactics could lead to civil war The rallies `` have a negative effect on the situation in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rexhepi </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership `` It's very bad for us now,'' said student <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rexhepi </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> with no known family ties to the politician. `` Nobody asks us anything. If we even organized a similar rally -LRB- to those held by the Serbs -RRB-, we would all be proclaimed Albanian separatists and sentenced.'' The ethnic crisis has been worsened by <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s economic backwardness. Seventy percent of the population is under 30, and 135,000 people are jobless. Listless, bored young men gather by the hundreds on <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>'s refuse-strewn streets. Those with jobs earn as little as $ 75 a month, less than half the national average. A middle-class family of four is lucky to live in a one-bedroom apartment in a building with broken light bulbs and windows and an entrance that reeks of garbage. Money from the richer republics has produced some incongruously luxurious buildings, such as the university library. `` We're the only country in the world that has borrowed money to finance its own destruction,'' said a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> journalist in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was referring to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s $ 21 billion debt and child support paid to Albanians for each of their many children. In the village of <LOCATION> Prekale </LOCATION>, armed Serbian vigilantes protect children from harassment by Albanian villagers and police patrol the area every six hours. `` The ordinary people _ it's not their fault. It's all the big heads that do this,'' says Serb villager <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksimovic </PERSON>. The villagers are ready to flee if ethnic violence erupts, but Serbian nationalists anxious to stem emigration from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> have persuaded many people to stay. `` I had to come back from -LRB- working in -RRB- <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to protect my family,'' said <PERSON> Maksimovic </PERSON>. `` I have to go with my kids every day to school, wait until they finish and then come back with them. We feel as if we are in a zoo, encircled by Albanians and guarded by police.''

<TEXT>
 Prisoners briefly seized control of a high-security section of the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, and guards later found an inmate dead in his cell, authorities said. The 3 -LCB- - hour rampage began when two unarmed guards ran into resistance trying to confiscate homemade liquor from inmates, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeese </PERSON>, executive assistant to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> The prisoners broke glass and burned mattresses and papers before surrendering. The death was being investigated as an apparent homicide, said <LOCATION> McNeese </LOCATION>. He said the victim's name was being withheld pending notification of relatives. He refused to release details of how the man was killed. After SWAT teams entered the building and inmates ended their disturbance without force, officers found the body during an inspection, <PERSON> McNeese </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It appears there was significant damage,'' said <LOCATION> McNeese </LOCATION>. It was mainly glass damage. `` There is n't that much in there to burn,'' he said. Someone broke through a cinderblock cell wall to get at the inmate, he said. He said there was no immediate information whether the disturbance was staged to aid the slaying. The cellblock involved normally has a population of 120. <PERSON> McNeese </PERSON> said he had no immediate indication how many inmates took part in the disturbance and destruction, but many remained in their cells.

 I'm not going to do that because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment. And the interesting place, one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is what's going to happen in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. You see the turmoil in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> today. And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade. I do n't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets. We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did. But this is an exciting time. But all I'm suggesting is, let's not be naive in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid. Look at the INF treaty. And if we have n't learned from the negotiating history on that we'll never learn. The freeze people were wrong. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was right. Excuse me. Lehrer: Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: That was a very different <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today, and you were right then <PERSON> George </PERSON> when you said that it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength. Of course not. What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent, strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces, and at the same time, a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully, cautiously. We have serious differences with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy, and in our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about. But there are opportunities there now. Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I have a plan for the 1990s and beyond; Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> do not. And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world, and we can do so while making choices here at home. Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand. We can not be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years That's why we need a Democratic administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1989. Lehrer: <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON>, a question for the governor. Groer: Yes. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking of seeming changes of position, you have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, `` a fantasy and a fraud'' to saying recently you would continue SDI research, and might even deploy the system if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supported such a move. Why the change of heart? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: No, there's been no change of heart. I've said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level it was at in 1983. That's about a billion dollars a year. But I do n't know of any reputable scientists who believe that this system, at least as originally conceived, could possibly work, this notion of some kind of an Astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack, makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration's now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. So, I am for continued research. But I also want strong conventional forces. Now, the other day Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Well, if we continued with Star Wars, we'd have to cut some place.'' He has n't told us where. We know where they're cutting We know where you're cutting right now. You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces. You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment There was an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general, not too long ago, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who ca n't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile because they do n't have enough fuel, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling _ they're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs _ because they do n't have enough fuel.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The rebellion in the rank and file of the 7,000-man army has dramatically reformed the high command, replacing corrupt and repressive remnants of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship with competent professionals. `` There is a democratic revolution going on in the army. No decision is made without the enlisted men,'' said <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, co-leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of three democratic political parties. The army purge began Sept. 17, when enlisted men and their sergeants ousted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, the head of government. They replaced him with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who as a brigadier general had been the army's top administrative officer. The soldiers sacked dozens of commanders at units across the country. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> endorsed their action and said 29 superior officers were retired. The sergeants who engineered the coup share daily decision-making with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, but they have promised to respect the chain of command under their newly appointed leaders, mostly younger junior officers. `` We are thankful to these nation-builders,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, co-writer of the 1987 Constitution, said of the soldiers. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> -RRB- must not forget that they are watching him and will punish any deviation.'' Soldiers speaking on radio stations identify themselves with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s oppressed poor and speak of human rights, democracy, free elections and re-establishing the constitution abolished by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. `` The army is the people and the people are the army,'' was the rebellion's slogan. An important motive of the mutiny was the desire to improve living and working conditions. Most soldiers earn less than $ 200 a month and live with their families in the city's wretched slums. Now they are demanding higher pay, subsidized housing, and medical and pension benefits. Corrupt officers such as Col. <PERSON> Gregoir </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, police chief of the capital, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, have been replaced by young professional officers such as the new police commander, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Valcin </PERSON>, who was trained in a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police academy. A survivor of the upheaval is Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, commander of the feared 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>, the only major unit in which soldiers did not mutiny. A Western diplomat said privately that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who was indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of drug-running, is popular because he is not arrogant, treats his troops well, and `` spreads money around to his men.'' The soldiers said they chose <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as president because he is honest and treats them with respect. During the 29-year family dynasty founded by <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and inherited by his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, the army was shunted aside, stripped of its traditional power and humiliated by the arrogant <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> private militia. When <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was ousted and fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986, the Macoutes were officially disbanded. The repressive army high command of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> appointees remained largely intact, taking over the Macoutes' lucrative contraband and drug-smuggling activities and siphoning off public funds. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, a quiet country doctor the army expected to manipulate, rose to power in 1957 in military-rigged elections. Instead, he used the <LOCATION> Tonton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macoutes </LOCATION> to terrorize the population into submission and loosen the army's grip on power. In the early 1960s, <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> closed the military academy and exiled, retired or shot scores of army officers considered a threat to his power. Professional officers either opted to collaborate with the dictator or were forced into submission. A low-ranking, illiterate Macoute wielded more power than an army officer. When <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> took over as president-for-life upon his father's death in 1971, he reopened the military academy. The graduates soon discovered they had no chance of promotion in an officer corps clogged by <PERSON> Duvalierists </PERSON>, who remained in power even after the dictator's departure. `` If an army is a disciplined group of men in arms, there is no Haitian army,'' a major said in an interview shortly before <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s ouster. `` What we have are more or less discordant centers of authority ... infiltrated by criminal elements,'' he said. Rank-and-file soldiers, already envious of officers' salaries of up to $ 3,500 a month for a general, were provoked into rebellion when thugs, many of them former Macoutes, attacked worshipers at a Sunday morning Mass in a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on June 11, killing 13 and wounding 77. Presidential Guard Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, the 27-year-old leader of the coup, said the enlisted men were disgusted by the massacre and other acts of violence under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and felt humiliated when the outraged public accused them of siding with the killers. <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, speaking in full battle gear on national television the night of the coup, said the soldiers' goal was `` to raise the prestige of the Haitian people, degraded by so many acts which have revolted our conscience.''

<HEAD>Democrats Confident They Can Move Minimum Wage Hike to Vote</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only one vote _ and possibly a few federal judgeships _ are stopping <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats from shutting off a Republican filibuster and passing the first increase in the $ 3.35 hourly minimum wage since 1981. But having lost two cloture votes last week in trying to break the logjam, Democratic leaders were unwilling to schedule a third attempt until after Sunday night's debate between presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Republican leaders following a White House-directed legislative strategy are insisting on paring down by about half the $ 1.20 increase in the minimum wage that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would like to implement over a three-year period. The Republicans also want to couple the increase to a new 90-day, 85 percent subminimum wage for newly hired workers, as long as no one would fall below the current $ 3.35 floor. The minimum wage bill is one of several facing an impatient <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> eager to adjourn to hit the fall campaign trail. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has warned senators to be prepared for Saturday sessions if the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to end by Oct. 16 _ a date two weeks beyond the original target date for finishing Behind the scenes, GOP leaders are holding the minimum wage bill hostage while trying to win a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders to act before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns on an unspecified number of the 29 federal judicial nominations that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Recalling that 17 of President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s judicial nominations disappeared in the interim between the November election in 1980 and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s taking office the following January, Republicans are determined that the same will not happen to them should <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> win. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> made it clear that any `` deal'' for allowing Democrats to move the minimum wage bill and possibly act on other social and environmental legislation does not have to involve all 29 of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominees to the bench. `` A shake of the hand will do it _ we do not need to have it in writing _ that these certain judges will be approved,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` That is really the issue before us and it really does not have anything to do with the minimum wage.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., the primary sponsor of the minimum wage increase, expressed confidence in picking up the 60th vote needed to end the filibuster, regardless of whether a deal is struck on the judicial nominations Last Friday, eight Republicans _ five more than on Thursday _ joined 48 Democrats in a 56-35 vote seeking to break the filibuster. `` I believe we're on the edge of having a successful resolution,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders, however, were confident that no more members in their party would break ranks and suggested that a few might even switch back. Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> all were absent during Friday's vote <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> believes all three will support him. Assuming none of the Republicans switch, that means he has to get one vote from among Democratic Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said some senators on his side of the aisle were `` confused'' on Friday's vote `` By Monday, they'll realize what's at stake,'' he said. Proposals to overhaul the welfare system and to grant parents unpaid leave from work to care for newborn or sick children still are the subject of late-session maneuvering. Several appropriations bills, including one $ 300 billion measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has vetoed once already, have been approved in one form or another but differences remain between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions. Also still pending is the biggest environmental bill of the last two years _ a revision of the Clean Air Act with tighter prohibitions on urban air pollution and acid rain. Closed-door negotiations over the clean air legislation have been taking place for several weeks on both sides of the Capitol, but lawmakers remain divided on whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can agree on the complicated package in the remaining three weeks. Slated for House action this week is a bill authorizing 20 new water projects around the country by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. Even if the legislation is approved, the projects also require the passage of separate appropriations bills before construction on them can begin. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has declined to approve funds for any new projects because of the budget deficit.

<TEXT>
 You have to make choices. We're not making those choices, and to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently wants to _ although he himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately _ on `` Star Wars,'' in my judgment, makes no sense at all. We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent. We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now. On land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 40 times over. They have about 12,000. So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down, but to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks _ at least that's what I read. Maybe, he'll tell us where he stands on it tonight. Q. Mr. Vice President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I'm not reconsidering my position. Two questions _ how do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces, when the Soviets are modernizing? And, how come you spend _ willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy, and a fraud? Those are two, hypo-rhetorical questions. He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battlegroups. The armed forces _ the conventional forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have never been more ready. Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is at an historic high. And, secondly, in terms of the cutting of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, it was the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ so please help us with that, who cut $ 70 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> out of the interdiction effort on narcotics. He's got to get this thing more clear. Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud? I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We've sent up the levels of funding, and when it is deployable, I will deploy it That's my position on SDI, and it's never waivered a bit. Lehrer: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a question for Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Jennings: Well, governor, and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you both talked tonight about hard choices. Let me try to give you one. Somewhere in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage. If you are commander in chief, and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you _ their individual fate, their individual fate, or the commitment that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government must never negotiate with terrorists. And, if any Americans are held hostage, and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens. We care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back, and understandably so, and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. But, if there's one thing we also understand it is that you can not make concessions to terrorists, ever _ ever. Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. And that's the tragedy of the Iran-Contra scandal.

<HEAD>Dukakis Advantage: Close Debate Often Goes to the Challenger</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In lines they've been polishing all campaign long, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traded familiar accusations in a leadoff debate with no clear winner _ a standoff that may well benefit the Democratic challenger. The confrontation at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on an even platform with the better-known Republican nominee, two men displaying their presidential wares. Absent a telling blow from one debater or the other, that usually works to the advantage of the outsider, in this case the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. But a breakthrough on the issues will have to await their next confrontation, three weeks away. In 90 minutes of Sunday night campaign debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> summarized what they have been saying to voters every day for months. There were no surprises, no secret weapons. Neither man landed a major punch. The campus chapel, converted to a television auditorium for the night, was just another campaign stop _ with a vastly larger audience. Based on the presidential campaign debates that have gone before, the forum itself is likely to be more of a plus for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign than for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, less for what they did in debate than for where they started. It usually has worked that way for the challenger, for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> versus <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, even, in their first debate, for Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, heavily favored for re-election, reversed that when they met a second time. The vice president is an administration incumbent with an administration record to defend. He did so at one point by saying he would take all the blame for the Iran-Contra affair and for any mistakes in dealing with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if he could have only half the credit for the things President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has accomplished in the cause of world peace. Because the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> outsider is the likely beneficiary, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign wanted fewer debates than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought, and wanted them early in the fall, not close to the Nov. 8 election. They got their way; the final Bush-Dukakis debate will be in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Oct. 13 or 14. There were no major gaffes in the opening debate, nothing to compare with <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s 1976 insistence that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does not dominate <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did misspeak in a discussion of weapons systems, but sought to deflect the slip-up with a joke on himself. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shunned the scholarly, defensive stance that once gave him problems, and concentrated on offense. For all that, and despite the questions posed by debate panelists about specific issues, the basic fare for each candidate was his attack on the other one. That's been a constant complaint about the presidential campaign fare of 1988, and the first debate did little to change it. Each candidate questioned the other's judgment. The course of the forum was signaled when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked to name three specific federal programs he would cut in order to reduce the budget deficit. He mentioned one, sort of. `` I've suggested there are certain weapons systems which we do n't need and ca n't afford,'' he said Then he talked about economic growth, lower interest rates and better tax enforcement. Then he went on offense, saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget claims would turn him into the <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON> of American politics. `` Is now the time to unleash our one-liners?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` That answer was about as clear as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget formulation was hardly less murky. He talked about his `` flexible freeze'' on spending, blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for current problems, claimed a cut in the capital gains tax will generate more revenues instead of less, and promised, `` I will not raise taxes.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had raised taxes five times, and did n't even have a defense budget to worry about in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got weapons systems confused in one answer, he joked that it was like his problem getting dates correct, as when he misdated Pearl Harbor Day. `` Would n't it be nice to be perfect, to be the ice man, so you never make a mistake?'' Later, he made another one, in defending Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his vice presidential nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there are three men on the ticket who are knowledgeable in defense. He corrected that to say three men in the campaign. He obviously meant to include Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, and to exclude <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It did n't work. `` Did I sense a desire that maybe <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ought to be your running mate?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back.

<HEAD>Most Farmland Sales Still Between Farmers, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When farmers sell out, the odds favor their land being bought by other farmers in the neighborhood, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst says the outcome also depends on the region of the country. According to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> survey, a total of 7,150 transactions involving about 2.3 million acres were reported between Sept. 1, 1987, and Feb. 1, 1988. Overall, there was no dramatic shift in the use or ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmland, says <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Around 2 percent to 4 percent of all agricultural land changes hands each year, and the majority of buyers are farm operators. The 1988 survey showed that 64 percent of the farmland was bought by farmers who already owned and operated land as farm units. That compared with 60 percent in the 1987 survey and 65 percent in 1986. Hexem, reporting in the October issue of Farmline magazine, said 25 percent of the land was bought by non-farmers, 10 percent by tenants and 1 percent by retired farmers. `` The proportion of acres bought for non-agricultural uses varies among regions,'' the report said. `` Non-farm activity is often highest in the Northeast, <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION>, where non-farm buyers and non-agricultural uses figure more prominently.'' On average, sales in these regions involve considerably smaller land parcels. Nationally, farmland sales averaged 317 acres, according to this year's survey, while in the Northeast the average was 141 acres; <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, 115; and Southeast, 194. Also, the report said, the share of land bought by farm owners and operators varied by region, compared with the 64 percent national average. In the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region, for example, about 80 percent of the land sales went to other farmers, while in the Northeast only 41 percent was bought by farmers. `` Producers have been relatively less active in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and Southeast markets for most of the 1980s,'' the report said. `` For example, the amount of acreage reportedly bought by owner-operators in the Northeast fell from 59 percent in 1983 to 41 percent in 1988. `` In the Southeast, it dropped from 71 percent in 1983 to 42 percent. At the same time, acreage bought by non-farmers in the Southeast rose from 23 percent in 1983 to 55 percent this year.'' <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said part of this trend results from greater demand for land along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from non-agricultural sources. Urban sprawl around such cities as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> has been a major factor. The demand includes more land for homes, shopping centers, office complexes, industrial centers, roads and airports. <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said additional demand comes from second homes, retirement homes and recreational uses. Even so, <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said, most of the land that has changed hands is expected to continue in agricultural production for the foreseeable future. According to the survey, about 91 percent of the recently sold farmland nationwide will probably remain in agriculture for the next five years. An additional 1 percent is expected to go into forestry and about 8 percent into other uses, including housing, recreation and commercial and industrial sites. Land most likely to stay in farming five year after being sold is in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> regions, <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said. One reason is that farming predominates in these areas, with less competition from other land uses. Another development has been an increase in the acres per parcel of land sold and a decrease in the average price per acre of the reported sales. In 1988, sales averaged 317 acres nationwide, up from 236 acres in 1987. Prices dropped to $ 566 per acre from $ 607 in 1987. <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said some of this can be attributed to several large tracts of land, likely rangeland, sold at relatively low prices in the <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> regions. While accounting for only 13 percent of the land transactions, the two regions were responsible for 45 percent of the acreage that changed hands, he said. The survey showed that buyers have been acquiring land with less credit, many using cash instead. In 1988, the report said, 70 percent of the sales were financed, down from 73 percent last year and 90 percent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. <PERSON> Hexem </PERSON> said the 70 percent `` is comparable to financing levels of the early 1960s.'' Credit-financed sales remained most popular in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> states and Mountain regions, while cash sales increased in the Corn Belt, <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the Southeast.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: Iran-Contra scandal.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 As a matter of fact, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the chairman of a task force on international terrorism, which issued a report shortly before that decision was made, and said _ and rightly so _ that we never, ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers. And yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country, and I dare say, encouraged others to take hostages, as we now know. So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do, it's an open invitation to others to do that same. We've got to be tough on international terrorism. We've got to treat it as international crime. We've got to attack it at all points. We've got to use undercover operations. We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps. We have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them. And we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism. Yes, we should make every effort to try help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions. That was a tragic mistake that we made _ mistake that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made, and others made, and it should never, ever be made again. Q. Mr. Vice President? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we should n't trade arms for hostages, but we made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps but, when the president saw the state-sponsored fingerprints of <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on the loss of American life, he hit <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action. And since that action _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: That's not true. That's not true. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ terrorist action against <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizens have gone down. And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter. And I've said mistakes were made _ clearly, nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. That is a very serious charge against the president. And that has been thoroughly looked into. But, the point is, sometimes the action has to be taken by the federal government. And, when we took action, it had a favorable response. Lehrer: A question for the vice president, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. Jennings: It seems, perhaps, a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that you've campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team. But, so far, you wo n't tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president on issues, including the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. And what should have been done about the hostages. To the best of my knowledge, there's no constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> urged his vice president, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Would you now ask President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for permission to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people what advice you did give him? And, if you do n't, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: You judge by the whole record. You judge by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>? Or, in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> countries on the western side of the gulf? Is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> talking to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>? How does it look in a program he called phony, or some one of these marvelous <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> adjectives up there, about <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>? Now, we have a chance, now _ several Bostonians do n't like it but the rest of the country will understand _ now, we have a chance. Now, we have a chance. Now, we have a chance. And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.

 <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> has yet to graduate its first class but already more than a sixth of its 340 seniors have been named National Merit Scholarship semifinalists. And a 16-year-old junior led a four-student team to victory over 1,500 schools in a rigorous nationwide competition for a $ 1 million supercomputer last month. In other respects, the kids in the school in <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, are normal teen-agers. They go out for football, plaster their classroom walls with posters and art, produce a school newspaper, audition for the drama club play. But their academic record is something else. The seniors' performance in the Merit Scholarship competition placed the high school fifth among the 19,000 schools that participated `` Is n't it fabulous?'' says <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON>. `` This is the first full year of a four-year school, and it has already made its mark.'' A passion for learning among the student body and unusual cooperation make <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> a trend-setter among high schools in this era of burgeoning technology. `` What characterizes the environment in this building is extraordinary intellectual stimulation _ a sense of enjoyment of learning and a commitment to excellence,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruter </PERSON>, admissions and staff development director. `` It's really phenomenal.'' The school won the supercomputer thanks to a project by <PERSON> Manish </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuteja </PERSON>, 16, called `` Complex Plane Analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> Newton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raphson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Method </ORGANIZATION> on High Order Polynomials.'' The project focused on a method for deriving formulas in calculus, involving work being done in relatively new study of chaos, according to principal <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` The work he did was quite significant and likely will lead to publication,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> opened in fall 1985 in an area that's growing faster than any in the country in the high-tech field. Sixteen-hundred teen-agers are bused in daily from all over northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Only one in three eighth-grade students who hope to attend <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> meet its rigorous standards for admission. Aspirants must take a standardized test and write an essay. School officials also take into account their previous school experiences, including grades, activities, and ability and interest in science and mathematics. Students pursue parallel programs in science and technology. The science curriculum follows the standard college preparatory course, with classes in earth science, biology, calculus and the other usual requirements. The technology portion focuses on learning by doing in the real world. `` We have a strong tie with business and industry that leads us to a different model of education, focusing on the technology as it's being used and developed in the field,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` The ideal program for us is to have student and faculty who are actually working with people in the industry on the same technologies and learning the science and math as part of the experience.'' Corporations have donated computer labs and other equipment to the young school, and professionals visit regularly to teach and work with students. `` We actually send students out to work in the field,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, pointing out the example of <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, where students work part-time and during the summer. Other companies that support <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> include <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hazelton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BDM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dynalectron </PERSON> and TRW. The high-tech focus at the school is balanced by a strong humanities program and a sports program. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> plays down the Merit Scholarship aspect of his school's success, saying the standardized tests are `` not a good measure of school success. His challenge is finding innovative ways to measure how well <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> fulfills its mandate as one of the first schools in the nation to focus intensively on science and technology. `` One of our real challenges or goals is to develop a model for scientific and technological education, and to see if that model is different from what has traditionally happened in the schools,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.

 And let me say this, all he can talk about, he goes around ranting about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran-Contra, and also _ I'll make a deal with you. I will take all the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all of the good things that have happened in world peace since <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I took over from the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration. I still, I still have a, I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a different principle here on _ Lehrer: Sorry, sorry, Mr. Vice President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: It's only on yellow out here, wait a minute. Lehrer: I'm sorry. I'm wrong. Go ahead. My apologies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>. Lehrer: You said, nobody's perfect. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I said, I was n't perfect, but I thought you were. Where was I? Lehrer: My apology. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: The 25th of December, Mr. Vice President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I agree. I agree. Where was I? Lehrer: Governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: He can have another 10 seconds if he wants to. Lehrer: Yes, sir. Go ahead. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Go ahead. Lehrer: All right. All right. Governor, you have a minute to respond. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, the matter of judgment is very important, and I think it's important to understand what happened here. A report on international terrorism chaired by the vice president was released, and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism. They were ignored. The vice president ignored them. It says mistakes were made _ very serious mistakes in judgment were made. He says, `` Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' who's made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to the Contras through convicted drug dealers. I think those are very, very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review. We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes. You can not make concessions to terrorists. If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages. That's a basic principle. It was ignored in that case, and it was a very, very serious mistake in judgment. Lehrer: Go to a question from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>. It goes to the vice president. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>: Mr. Vice President, Democrats, and even some Republicans, are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, your chosen running mate, to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. What do you see in him that others do not? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I see a young man that was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I'm putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in their forties. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act, and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in so if a person loses his job, he is retrained for a benefit, for a work that will be productive and he wo n't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberals keep talking about. I see a young man who is knowledgeable in defense. And there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgable in the whole, in the race, knowledgable in defense, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is one of them, and I am one of them. And I believe that he will be outstanding. And he took a tremendous pounding, and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding. And I'd like each person to say, did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he's kept his head up and he will do very, very well And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their thirties and forties and more. So judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name. My opponent says, `` <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' Do you know who <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> was? He was a man that gave his life in World War II. So ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process and he'll do very well when we get into the debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, when it comes to ridicule, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that. Bush: Just the facts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: But did I sense a desire that maybe <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ought to be your running mate when you said that the three people on your ticket? -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Bush: No. I think the debate ought to be _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>; somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. I doubt very much that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of `` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'' is a very, very troubling notion tonight.

 <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> was 14 when he was told his mother was a Tibetan saint who lived 300 years ago. But it was n't much of a surprise to him. `` She was always giving advice and teaching people,'' he says of his mother, <PERSON> Catharine </PERSON>, who was enthroned Saturday as the Western world's first adult reincarnate lama. Now 16, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> eventually plans to continue the path of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, known as dharma, and become a monk. `` There is certainly an adjustment when you find out that Mom is not just Mom,'' says her husband, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> prayer center in <LOCATION> Poolesville </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` But there was no question that she always was extraordinary.'' <PERSON> Catharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>, a 38-year-old mother of three, had been a meditation teacher in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Penor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinpoche </PERSON>, a `` living Buddha'' who runs a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monastery in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, visited her classes in 1985 and told her that her instinctive knowledge was Tibetan Buddhism, and that her wisdom was that of a Tibetan saint, <PERSON> Ahkon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lhamo </PERSON>, who helped found a monastery the mid-1600s. He returned to the center Saturday, which he named the seat of his teachings in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to perform the ceremony. `` I was teaching Buddhism before I ever read a book on it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> said while sipping tea after the ceremony. The reincarnate lamas, teachers with an obligation to help rid the world of suffering, are venerated by Tibetan Buddhists because they are believed to return to this world voluntarily to enlighten others. Usually such lamas are recognized as children to be the reincarnation of their predecessor who recently died. `` In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> there are -LRB- reincarnate lamas -RRB- who have walked up to their parents and said ` I am not Joe-Bob, I am so-and-so. Take me to my monastery,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> said. She was born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to a Roman Catholic Italian father and Jewish mother. She attended high school and community college in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and moved to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in 1982 to establish a place for meditation. The <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> center, formally established in 1983 as <PERSON> Kunsang </PERSON> <PERSON> Odsal </PERSON> <PERSON> Palyul </PERSON> <PERSON> Changchub </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheoling </PERSON>, is a temple of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> teaching and prayer devoted to the cessation of suffering. Its members are some 70 professionals in the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> area who take shifts maintaining a 24-hour prayer vigil, and fund the center through private donations.

<HEAD>Audience Interprets Bush Remark as Slur on Boston Region</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew a deep groan from the presidential debate audience in questioning <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' use of `` phony or some one of these marvelous <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> adjectives'' to describe the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's foreign policy. With a long `` o-o-o-h,'' the audience appeared to have interpreted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remark during the presidential debate Sunday night as a regional slur, appealing to a belief among many voters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home town is a cradle for liberal politicians and ideas. `` Several Bostonians do n't like it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in response to the utterances from the audience, `` But the rest of the country will understand.''

 Lehrer: All right. <PERSON> John </PERSON> will now ask a question of the governor. It will be the last question, and then the vice president will have a rebuttal. <PERSON> John </PERSON>? <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>: Well, governor, you did select <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: I did, indeed. <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON>: And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tax cuts, aid to the rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the death penalty, gun control _ who's right? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, I'm a man who's been a chief executive for 10 years. I've picked a lot of people. I've picked cabinets, I've named judges I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern. And I set high standards, I try to meet them, and I insist that people who work for me meet them. And if they do n't, they do n't stick around very long But, I did n't pick <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> because he was a clone of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong vice president, somebody who would be an active vice president, somebody who would come to me, if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages, and say, `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, that's wrong. We should n't do that.'' That's the kind of vice president I want He himself has said, and rightly so, that he will be a strong vice president, but when the president makes a decision, that will be his decision. And I am very, very proud of that choice. And I did n't pick him because he agreed with me on everything. You know, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> once said that if two people agree on everything, then only one person is doing the thinking. The fact is that I've picked somebody who not only will be a great vice president, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership. I doubt very much, I doubt very much that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection for the vice presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> meets that test. Lehrer: Mr. Vice President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: We obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the test. We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum _ wonderful, friendly fashion like this. I had hoped that this'd, I'd hoped this had been a little friendlier an evening. I'd wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him, but I think now we're, we've got the lines too carefully drawn here. But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment? I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of the foreign policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser, now in jail in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>? I mean, I do n't think this is a fair argument, but nevertheless, I support my nominee for vice president, and he'll do an outstanding job. Lehrer: Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Getting it in my ear. And <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON> will ask it. Groer: To Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>? Lehrer: To, to the governor. Sorry. <PERSON> Groer </PERSON>: Oh, I'm so sorry. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries. Do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans? And if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt, and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently _ which they have incurred, and which is burdening them, and which, if we do n't do something about it and assist them, along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future, and at the same time, we'll destroy markets that are important to our farmers. But I also believe that we need an agricultural policy which does n't cost us the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration. I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies, and thanks to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping, and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers. I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used some momentary confusion over weapons systems in the presidential debate to poke fun at his tendency to utter bloopers on the campaign trail. `` It's Christmas,'' the vice president said during the debate with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after confusing the Midgetman and Minuteman with the MX missile but correcting himself immediately. Laughter erupted from the audience, remembering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reference earlier this month to the Japanese bombing of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> as occurring on Sept. 7, 1941, instead of Dec. 7. `` Would n't it be nice to be perfect?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quipped in response to the laughter. He then played to a Republican theme that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is cold and aloof. `` Would n't it be nice to be the ice man, so you never make a mistake?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got the last laugh by picking up on the same quip when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later objected to moderator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> cutting off his response to a question on the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal. `` It's only on yellow here, wait a minute,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to a light at the front of the stage warning that his response time for the question was about to expire, but had not yet. <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> admitted he was wrong, apologized _ saying `` You said nobody's perfect'' _ and told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to go ahead with his answer. `` I said I was n't perfect, I thought you were,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON>, drawing more giggles from the audience. `` Where was I?'' `` The 25th of December, Mr. Vice President,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered. `` I agree,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I've finished.''

 And I think it also is going to require an administration that understands that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time: biodegradable plastic, gasohol, which the vice president himself has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products. I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers. But I do n't think there is anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms, and providing a good, strong future for rural communities and for rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and at the same time working on Third World debt. As a matter of fact, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> itself is one of our biggest agricultural customers. So, in the sense that we can work to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, we build and expand and deal with its very serious economic problems; we help our farmers at the same time. Lehrer: Mr. Vice President. Bush: I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the Farm Bill, the'85 Farm Bill, and its spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad, and that's why I'd like to call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it, and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. I want to see rural redevelopment, and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy, and one of them is gasohol, and it comes from using your corn, and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradables, for a lot of products. So, I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy. In terms of the Third World, I support the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan. I want to see market economies spring up all around the world. And, to the degree they do, we are succeeding. And I do n't want to see the banks let off the hook; I would oppose that. But I think we're on the right track in agriculture, and I am very, very encouraged. But let's not go back to, that's what they call `` supply management'' and `` production control,'' that will simply price us out of the international market. Let's try to expand our markets abroad. Lehrer: All right. That really is the end. Now, let's go to closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes first. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, second. Mr. Vice President. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I talked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> about a gentler and kinder nation, and I have made specific proposals on education, and the enviroment, on ethics, on energy, and on how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election: opportunity and peace. I want to keep this expansion going. Yes, we want change, but we are the change, I am the change. I do n't want to go back to malaise and misery index. And so opportunity, keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at work. The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector. And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible. And I want to build on it; I want to see us finalize that START agreement; and I want to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons. I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces. And then it gets down to a question of values. We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight, and on tough sentencing of drug kingpins and this kind of thing. I do favor the death penalty. And we've got a wide array of differences on those.

 But in the final analysis, in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth they're going to say: Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and the stability to get the job done? My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support. Thank you very much. Lehrer: Governor. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: This has been an extraordinary 18 months for <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> and me, and for our family. We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country, to meet with so many of you in communities, states and regions, to get to know you. I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation, providing we have the kind of leadership in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country. You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants, like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunity, seeking the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world. That those of us, especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants, had a special responsibility to give something back to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them. I believe in the American dream. I am a product of it. And I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land _ with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country. With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. With decent and affordable health care for all working families. Yes, it's a tough problem, as Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, but it's not an insolvable problem. It's one that we will solve and must solve _ with a clean and wholesome environment. And with a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that's strong militarily and economically, as we must be. An <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that provides strong, international leadership because we're true to our values. We have an opportunity, working together, to build that future, to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to build the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Because the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't hide, we compete. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't waste, we invest. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't leave some of its citizens behind, we leave _ we bring everybody along. And the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us, the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come. Thank you very much for listening.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Here are excerpts of the debate Sunday night between presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Question: What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I think we've seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while, as a nation, we condoned those things we should have condemned. ... Dukakis: ... It's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top. ... Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids. ... And governors like me, and others, have been trying to deal with the consequences. ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. ... Question: ... Would you identify for us ... three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... There are certain weapons systems which we do n't need and we ca n't afford ... Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. ... Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down ... And finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed ... The thing I do n't understand about Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. ... If he keeps this up he's going to be the <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON> of American politics. ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... That answer was about as clear as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. ... When you cut capital gains you put people to work. ... Now <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> does n't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless the governor raised taxes five different times. ... Question: ... Today, 37 million Americans, including many working families with aging parents and young children, can not afford any health insurance _ but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them, and how will you pay for it? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: One thing I will not do, is sock every business in the country, and thus, throw some people out of work. ... What I will do, is permit people to buy into Medicaid. ... Dukakis: ... It's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who do n't have a dime of health insurance, and do n't know how to pay the bills if the kids get sick at night. ... Question: ... What is so wrong with the governor being a member of an organization -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- which has come to the defense of, among other people, Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... I do n't agree with a lot of the, most of the positions of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. ... He has every right to exercise his passion as what he said: a strong, progressive liberal. ... They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill. ... I'm not questioning his patriotism. ... I am questioning his judgment on these matters. ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism. ... And I resent it, I resent it. Question: ... What commitment are you willing to make tonight to -LRB- the homeless -RRB-? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to spend billions and trillions on `` Star Wars.'' ... Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions? Or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country ... Question: ... If abortions were to become illegal again, do you think that the women who defy the law ... and the doctors who performed them, should go to jail? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I have n't sorted out the penalties, but I do know -- I do know that I oppose abortion, and I favor adoption. ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision. ... Question: ... If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush Administration have so many programs to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... I think part of it is the crime-infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat _ the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: Well, I must have been living through a different eight years from the one that the Vice President's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. ... Question: ... Where would you get the money to devote to the inner cities ... Dukakis: ... If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids do n't lose their health benefits when she goes to work ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should. ... Question: Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters. ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... That's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said about Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> back in 1980. ... The vice president has a long resume, but it did n't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah. ... His experience did n't prevent him from ... being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the drug-trafficking in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He went to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the early'80s and commended <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for his commitment to democracy. And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America ... Bush: ... I've met Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. I met Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> ... These people are tough. ... But please, do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and we, when we were the laughing stock around the world. ...

 Question: ... Are you prepared to tell the voters one system ... that you'd be willing to cut or even eliminate that would n't endanger national security <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... What I am not going to do when we are negotiating with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, ... I'm not going to give away a couple of aces in that very tough card game. ... We are going to make some changes and some tough choices before we go to deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the, on the Minuteman _ whatever it is _ we're going to have to _ the MX, MX. ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to spend billions on Star Wars. He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars ... I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman. I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely. ... I am for the Stealth, I am for the D-5, I am for going ahead with the advanced cruise missile. ... Question: ... Should we be doing a lot to help the economics and the social development of a country that we have so long regarded as an adversary? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open, be cautious, because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent ... and at the same time, a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully, cautiously. ... Question: ... You have gone from calling the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, `` a fantasy and a fraud'' to saying recently you would continue SDI research, and might even deploy the system if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supported such a move ... Dukakis: ... I've said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level it was at in 1983. ... But I do n't know of any reputable scientists who believe that this system, at least as originally conceived, could possibly work ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces, when the Soviets are modernizing? Question: ... If any Americans are held hostage, and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... You can not make concessions to terrorists, ever _ ever. Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us. ... -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> in exchange for hostages ... Bush: ... I've said mistakes were made _ clearly, nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. ... Question: ... So far, you wo n't tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president on issues ... And, if you do n't, how do we judge your judgment in the Oval Office in the last eight years? <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: You judge by the whole record. ... Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>? ... Is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> talking to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> about peace? ... Are the Soviets coming out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>? ... Dukakis: ... I think those are very, very serious questions of judgment ... We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes. ... Question: Democrats, and even some Republicans, are still expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... I see a man who is young and I'm putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in their forties. ... I see a young man who is knowledgeable in defense. ... So judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name. ... Dukakis: ... I picked <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>; somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. I doubt very much that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the best qualified person for that job ... Question: ... You have a lot of disagreement with -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -RRB- on fundamental issues ... who's right? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... I did n't pick <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> because he was a clone of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong vice president, somebody who would be an active vice president, somebody who would come to me, if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages, and say, `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, that's wrong. We should n't do that.'' ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgment? I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of the foreign policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser, now in jail in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>? ... Question: Do you favor giving -LRB- <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Third World -RRB- countries a break in their loans? And if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers ...? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... If we do n't do something about it and assist them, along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future, and at the same time, we'll destroy markets that are important to our farmers But I also believe that we need an agricultural policy which does n't cost us the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion a year ... Bush: ... I want to expand our markets abroad, and that's why I'd like to call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it, and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country. ... CLOSING STATEMENTS <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: ... There are two main focal points of this election: opportunity and peace. ... Yes, we want change, but we are the change, I am the change. I do n't want to go back to malaise and misery index. ... And in terms of peace, we are on the right track. We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible. And I want to build on it ... In the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth they're going to say: Who has the values I believe in? Who has the experience that we trust? Who has the integrity and the stability to get the job done? My fellow Americans, I am that man ... <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: ... My parents came to this country as immigrants ... They made sure their sons understood this is the greatest country in the world. That those of us, especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants, had a special responsibility to give something back to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them. ... We have an opportunity, working together, to build that future, to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to build a best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Because a best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't hide, we compete. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't waste, we invest. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't leave some of its citizens behind, we leave _ we bring everybody along. And the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us, the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says her election as the first woman bishop in the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>'s 450-year history offers new hope to those who've felt alienated and ignored by the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Sunday in her sermon at the Church of the Advocate, where she serves as interim rector. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is attempting to include everyone in the mainstream `` of God's justice, grace, brotherhood and sisterhood,'' the black cleric told a congregation of 50. Pointing to the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` Rainbow Coalition,'' reaching across color and sexual lines, she said the church's action gives `` new hope ... and new vision to hundreds of thousands'' who have felt left out of the denomination Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a 58-year-old former public relations executive, was elected Saturday to the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop for the eastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> diocese. The diocese, which includes <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest in both geography and population. However, the third-ranking prelate in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said Sunday he will refuse to recognize Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> or any other woman bishop. `` I have already stated publicly ... that I would not be able to be in communion with a woman so elected and consecrated,'' said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Bishops at a world Anglican conference this summer approved a resolution saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with churches that have women priests and bishops, even if they disagree with their principles. Several appointments earlier this year show the church is changing, said Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Two black priests were elected coadjutor bishops, who are first in line to succeed their presiding bishops, without first serving as assistants. One, the Rev. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was installed in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on Saturday as the first black bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told the congregation her election `` is of significance to the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to the worldwide Anglican Communion.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, retired pastor of the Church of the Advocate, said Sunday that Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' election will allow other qualified women to move into bishop positions. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is one of 27 self-governing church bodies in 164 countries that comprise the Anglican Communion. About 70 million people belong, with 2.5 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After services, Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she was `` deeply honored'' to accept the position. She declined to answer questions until a news conference scheduled Tuesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Philadelpia </LOCATION> native was a parishioner at the Church of the Advocate in 1974 when the first 11 female Episcopal priests were ordained there _ against church rules at the time. Ms. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a divorcee, was ordained a priest in 1980, four years after the church changed its policy. She was pastor in <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION> from 1980 to 1984, then became executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The debate was over and gridlock reigned in the press room. It was n't reporters trying to reach <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it was the stampede of political heavyweights shamelessly promoting their candidate's performance while making the other guy's seem abysmal. Senators and governors competed for reporters' attention and television's cameras to claim that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came across as presidential, humane and compassionate and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as plastic and fuzzy _ or vice versa. In political parlance, it is known as the spin patrol and a glut of spin was spun by politicians brought in for just that purpose. The Democrats had the likes of Sens. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and the Republicans had Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> cafeteria, turned into a press room, was packed with post-debate spinners, who needed no prompting to stand amenably, surrounded by cameras and tape recorders and reporters with notebooks. Other spinners made the rounds of the television shows. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> volunteered that his home state governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had scored a clear win. `` He was presidential, he was compelling, he was convincing,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The Democratic line on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was typified by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Donilon </PERSON>, who coordinated the Democrat's debate preparation: `` I do n't think he was very presidential tonight. He was n't in command and control. He was wandering.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showed he was `` a real human being'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` looked absolutely programmed'' as well as `` plastic.'' And <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> came up with this instant analysis: `` I thought the vice president looked very relaxed. I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked very clerkish.'' While each side claimed their candidate had won, many were willing to say that the winning and losing was not pronounced and some even ventured to acknowledge that the other candidate scored a point or two. `` I do n't think either candidate made any mistakes,'' owned up <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Several Democrats seized on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stumbles such as when he referred to the Midgetman missile, `` Or the Minuteman _ whatever it is.'' No, rebutted the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spinners, little mistatements showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was human, not a `` man who looks like a machine,'' in <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s description of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Appearances were important to the spinners because each side had wanted to project their man as a caring, humane candidate as well as one who grasped the issues. Predictably, each side expressed satisfaction on that score. Media consultant <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> who had coached <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on being more personable, said his candidate `` did everything that he needed to do and more.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who played the part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate practice sessions, on the other hand said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored `` a perfect 10'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came across as `` dour, stern, didactic.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was boring,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the defensive,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. Several Republicans, including <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> stressed that more than winning or losing, the debate helped crystallize the differences between the two candidates and in the mind of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ssupporters cement <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal. `` They both did fine. They both reinforced their positions,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who then could not resist adding the spin: `` All the swing voters that watched this, would come down on the side of the vice president.''

<HEAD>Soviet Father and Son Reunited After 22 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet journalist who defected to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1966 is now reunited with his son, who had tried in vain for more than 20 years to gain permission to emigrate. `` Today is the first day in my life that I have been really happy,'' said <PERSON> Anatoli </PERSON> <PERSON> Shustov </PERSON>, 43, standing arm-in-arm with his father, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` I have plans to improve my English and start a new life,'' he told reporters through an interpreter. <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON>, a 64-year-old journalist, last saw his son in December 1965 shortly before he sought political asylum during a visit to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with a group of writers. He said his protracted campaign to bring his son to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> came to nothing until the intervention of the British government last year, when Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> presented to Soviet authorities a list of some 20 Soviets seeking to emigrate to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, most to be reunited with family members. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> discussed the plight of those people with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when he stopped in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> Dec. 7 on his way to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The Foreign Office says many have since emigrated, but has declied to give a figure. <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> since 1980 <PERSON> Shustov </PERSON>, an industrial chemist, said he listened to his father's weekly broadcasts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Because he had applied to emigrate, <PERSON> Shustov </PERSON> said he was barred from working as a chemist and forced to take jobs as parking-lot attendant and shopkeeper _ `` such work where there would be no risk of getting any classified information.'' `` Maybe now I will work as an industrial chemist again,'' he said. <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> said he was `` still a little at sea'' over meeting his son again. `` I ca n't yet form an opinion but the omens are good,'' he said. `` I have good signs which I have n't had for years in my life _ good dreams, good happenings and good tidings altogether. I think it will be alright.'' <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> said he was committed to a labor camp in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> between 1947 and 1953 for `` using the wrong words'' and his son used to visit him there. `` I remember him sitting on my knee and saying to me, ` Dad, let's go home.'''

 A growing economic boycott by the international community could force change in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, where an angry populace and economic crisis are challenging the resolve of the new military government. But some analysts following the recent chaotic events in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation are skeptical that outside pressure can sway the top leadership, given its 26 years of isolationism and disregard of earlier calls for reform. `` There's very little leverage. If the outside world holds up its hands in horror, they -LRB- <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leaders -RRB- are still going to do what they think is necessary,'' one Bangkok-based diplomat said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which accounts for about 80 percent of foreign loans and grants to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, has just stopped sending assistance. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the No. 2 donor, froze its aid Sept. 5 and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced last week that it was suspending all but humanitarian help. These countries along with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and others have expressed concern over the violence in recent days. Western diplomats estimate that since last fall, several thousand demonstrators have been killed on orders from a military elite that seized power in 1962 and led one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most resource-rich countries into economic ruin and isolation. Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power a week ago in a military coup that overthrew civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. Diplomats say <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> is a close associate of Ne Win, who led the 1962 coup and ruled with an iron fist until he resigned in July after massive street protests. The recent political turmoil has crippled an economy that was already on a rapid downward spiral. Factories have halted production, transport has been paralyzed and foreign currency reserves are virtually at zero while the foreign debt has climbed to more than $ 4 billion. `` They're in such bad shape that if the Japanese and others just say ` absolutely no more' until there is some kind of democracy, there would be changes,'' American economic consultant <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said in an interview. But <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who has spent several years in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, said any economic boycott would have to be accompanied by continued popular _ and probably bloody _ resistance headed by a unified oppositon coalition. He said sanctions by the Japanese would have the greatest economic impact on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Sanctions by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gives a relatively modest $ 14 million, could have a significant `` moral, psychological'' impact, he said. Another expert on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said a `` carrot and stick approach'' could induce change. While halting all aid at present, the major donors should at the same formulate a comprehensive assistance program to be implemented when a pluralistic system emerges in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, he said. In the past, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been impervious to criticism by international human rights groups such as <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> _ and even to advice on economic policy from such major aid donors as the World Bank. Advocating strict neutrality, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> pulled out of the non-aligned movement in 1979 and since has taken other steps to minimize outside influence. It risked offending its biggest donor by closing down the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> offices of Japanese companies in 1986. `` <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been in the backwaters for 26 years, and <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> is benefiting from this,'' said Swedish <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Bertil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lintner </PERSON>. He said neither the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor giant neighbors <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have had real leverage with <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leaders and that all major powers have avoided interference for fear of provoking the others. Despite critical humanitarian needs, including basic medical supplies at hospitals overflowing with wounded victims, international emergency aid has to date been minimal. `` This is very much an affair of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> people ... but I hope the international community would be bit stronger about its protests,'' a key opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, said in an interview published in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, key donors including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> have provided as much as $ 500 milion a year in assistance to prop up the faltering economy. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germay </LOCATION> last year promised $ 36 million while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> offered $ 244.1 million in 1986, $ 172 million last year and only $ 27.5 million to date in 1988. The World Bank by mandate can not halt assistance for political reasons but can refrain from starting new projects. Neither it nor the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has issued a statement on the current situtation in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.

 In 90 minutes, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people a clear-cut choice on issues likely to land on the desk of the next occupant of the Oval Office: from housing the homeless to dealing with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Their debate Sunday night brought out in sharp relief their differences on the Strategic Defense Initiative, on taxes, on universal health insurance, the death penalty, abortion and other issues. Between the jibes and jabs, both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> managed to spell out many of the stands they have built their campaigns around. They fudged on some big questions, like how they would deal with the federal deficit, or fulfill campaign promises without adding to the red ink. When confronted with what one reporter called the nation's No. 1 domestic problem, drug abuse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested the answer is `` to instill values in these young people,'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> implied all would be well if the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> just had n't dealt with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. Here is a look at how other key issues played out in the debate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STAR WARS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of wanting to spend `` billions and trillions on Star Wars.'' He said he knew of no reputable scientist who believes this `` kind of an Astrodome over ourselves'' could work. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would continue basic Star Wars research at its 1983 level of $ 1 billion a year _ about a quarter of the current budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanded to know why he would `` spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy, and a fraud.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed, `` I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. We've sent up the levels of funding, and when it is deployable, I will deploy it. That's my position on SDI, and it's never waivered a bit.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his `` flexible freeze'' would help bring the deficit down. He also called for line-item veto authority and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested he'd find savings in agriculture subsidies, scrap certain weapons, find ways to bring interest rates down and bring in `` billions and billions'' by cracking down on tax cheats.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL GAINS TAX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to lower the tax on capital gains -LRB- from 28 to 15 percent -RRB- would cost $ 40 billion and provide a tax break of $ 30,000 -LRB- `` more than the average teacher makes'' -RRB- for people earning $ 200,000 a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when the capital gains tax was cut in the past, it produced more revenue and investment, not less.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his plan to seek legislation requiring most businesses to offer workers health insurance; that would reach 22 million of the 37 million Americans who now have no health insurance. `` I think it's time that when you get a job in this country it came with health insurance,'' the Democrat said. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that would cost businesses $ 35 billion. `` One thing I will not do, is sock every business in the country, and thus, throw some people out of work,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOMELESS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Asked about the nation's up to 3 million homeless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would fully fund the McKinney Act and seek to galvanize voluntary efforts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration created the problem by cutting back `` by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you have homeless families.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> countered that interest rates were 21 -LCB- percent the last time `` your party controlled the White House.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I do n't favor abortion. I do n't think it's a good thing. I do n't think most people do. The question is, who makes the decision? And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who favors outlawing all abortions except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest, ducked a question on whether he favors jailing women and doctors who defied such a law. `` I have n't sorted out the penalties,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supports Head Start; the <ORGANIZATION> Womens </ORGANIZATION>, Infant and Children nutrition program and expansion of Medicaid to help alleviate urban poverty, as well as cracking down on crime. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged the Reagan-Bush administration has `` cut and slashed and butchered'' education and nutrition programs for poor children, and aid for college. He accused the administration of resisting welfare reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said federal spending on education actually has risen in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his lack of experience in the foreign arena, saying that did n't hamper other governors who became president such as <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. And he charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` long resume ... did n't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah'' and being involved with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered a `` deal'' to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: `` I will take all the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all of the good things that have happened in world peace since <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I took over from the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied he favors `` unilateral disarmament,'' but acknowledged he would cut `` certain weapon system we do n't need and ca n't afford.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized his rival's opposition to the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles, saying the Soviets are tough negotiators, and `` I'm not going to give away a couple of aces in that very tough card game.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.'' He said the administration has suggested at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks `` that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Nikkei, dollar closings.
Pick up 4th pvs, Dealers said.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar edged up against the Japanese currency in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today while stock prices eased over widespread concerns about the health of ailing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The dollar closed at 134.73 yen, up 0.26 yen from its close on Thursday, the last day of trading. It opened at 134.80 yen and moved in a narrow range of 134.66-134 .85 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, shed 59.17 points or 0.22 percent to end Monday's trading at 27,330.95. Dealers said the dollar's strength followed a reaffirmation among monetary authorities from seven major industrialized countries, meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over the weekend, that they would continue to coordinate economic policies targeting stable exchange rates and containment of inflation. But they said the market needed fresh incentives to determine the direction of the currency. `` They -LRB- the G-7 -RRB- did not say whether the dollar should or should n't be traded higher or lower,'' complained one dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke anonymously. <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kita </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said steel issues turned out to be `` a driving force to gear up the index in late morning trading'' as investors began to buy prospective shares ahead of a new financial year beginning Tuesday. The Nikkei index lost 159.63 points, or 0.58 percent, in early trading, following a 38.19-point loss during Saturday's half-day session, after morning papers reported the emperor was continuing to receive blood transfusions. But palace officials later denied the reports and said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was in stable condition. <PERSON> Kita </PERSON> said, however, investors were still concerned about the 87-year-old monarch. Both the currency and stock markets in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were closed Friday because of a national holiday.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Demonstrators who wanted to deliver a message to the candidates were sealed off on the soccer field, but that did n't stop <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students from expressing themselves. Some undecideds hung a banner: `` Throw'em both back. Let's go fishing again.'' It could have been homecoming weekend _ with the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debate </ORGANIZATION> taking the place of the Big Game. There were banners, partisan crowds, a huge press contingent and a festive yet tense atmosphere Sunday as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> matched wits for 90 minutes in the chapel with millions of Americans looking on through television. Placards dotted the windows of buildings ringing the grassy quadrangle at the center of the tree-lined campus. Banners hung from windowsills with catchy slogans: `` I hate pork rinds. Vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' and `` Deacons do n't dig the Duke.'' Wake Forest's athletic teams use the nickname `` Demon Deacons.'' Other banners had less partisan messages: `` Do n't hide in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or run for the <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>. Come see for yourself who you like.'' Demonstrators representing a variety of causes hoped for a moment in the spotlight, but the university soccer field where they were shuttled off to was hundreds of yards away from the debate site. `` We'd like to be closer but that's something we ca n't do anything about,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, who held a sign touting the Equal Rights Amendment. As the debate time neared, a throng of star-struck students packed sidewalks near <LOCATION> Wait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION>, watching for the arrival of VIPs. Network anchors appeared to excite the crowd more than anyone if the flashbulb pops and gasps of recognition were any indication. Only two public entrances to the chapel were provided, creating huge traffic jams as people struggled through security checks. Inside, the crowd chatter grew and tension built in anticipation of candidates' grand entrance. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, entered the auditorium while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterpart <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> were welcoming the crowd. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wearing a dark blue dress, took her seat in the front row. After <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> stopped talking, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, entered through another door. She wore a black-and-white print dress and a pearl necklace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> partisans gave her a standing ovation; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters remained seated and did not clap. The vice president and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor walked onstage simultaneously from opposite sides, meeting at the center and cordially shaking hands. But they wasted no time attacking each other. Moderator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> had urged the feisty crowd not to applaud, cheer or otherwise disrupt the debate _ a plea that was ignored as the spectators vented their pleasure or disdain. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim that he was not attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s patriotism on the Pledge of Allegiance issue drew scornful laughter from the Democratic side of the aisle. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had been tough on criminals, it was the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> side's turn to guffaw. The applause and signs of displeasure became more frequent as the debate went on _ despite a second admonition from Lehrer _ and the candidates' exchanges got more heated. The temperatures inside the chapel seemed to rise; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently sipped water and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mopped his brow with a handkerchief as his rival delivered a closing statement. The combatants again shook hands and smiled after the debate's conclusion Members of the candidates' families hurried forward; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaned forward to kiss his wife while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife embraced. They lingered onstage for several moments; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> even autographed a couple of debate programs. Then both rushed away to post-debate rallies.

 None of the families of the seven astronauts who died in the Challenger disaster 32 months ago plan to attend Discovery's launch Thursday, and some may not even watch it on television, a spokeswoman says. `` I would hate to see anything happen to it -LRB- Discovery -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, father of Challenger astronaut <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, said in a recent interview. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, commanded the ill-fated spacecraft, said she, too, would not go to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for the launch. Some of the families have not even decided whether they will watch on TV, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up in memory of the crew. Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> said that `` like any other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen,'' she is eager for a successful Discovery mission to get <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s manned spaceflight program back on track. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs to focus on the launch facility, on the crew and their families,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` For me to be there would just remind everyone of that tragedy. And it would be difficult for me, too.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> has not been back to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> since Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch. Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> said the Challenger tragedy changed forever the way the <ORGANIZATION> Natonal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> goes about its business. `` I really think they're launching a new era. There's a new awareness of how vulnerable we are,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> said. Since the accident, the Challenger families have avoided discussions about their personal grief, and have focused their efforts on establishing a memorial to their lost loved ones, she said. Those efforts were rewarded last month with the opening of the first <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, a place where children can learn about space. The center, at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, gives students an opportunity to make a simulated spaceflight complete with a mission control center and scientific experiments. It was paid for with a $ 150,000 grant and will serve as a prototype for other small facilities associated with schools and museums. Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> and the other Challenger relatives conceived the center as a memorial to the crew and their educational mission. Besides <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, the Challenger astronauts were pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, high school teacher who was to have conducted the first classroom experiments from space. The Challenger crew's families have made many appearances to help raise money for the center and for other memorial events honoring the astronauts. Three of the widows, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, still live in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area. Mrs. <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON> lived in the same area until April, when she moved close to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> still lives in <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> was not married, but her brother, Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, has been active in the Challenger Center efforts <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> continues to practice law in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, where he can be seen around town with his two children. <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> avoids publicity concerning his wife, and his law firm would not comment on his plans for the Discovery launch.

 Political partisans heaped on the hyperbole in the aftermath of the presidential candidates' debate, but independent observers said neither nominee delivered the zinger that could change the face of their race. Who won? `` Who knows. This is a media event. This is entertainment,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, political science chairman at <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Both of the men scored well with the people who are already supporting them.'' Politicians promptly backed <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> up: Republicans declared <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the clear victor of Sunday's 90-minute confrontation at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, while Democrats unabashedly designated <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the champion. `` I believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> not only won the debate but the election tonight,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> really laid him out,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, Republican of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Professional analysts were more reluctant to pick a winner, and even some elected officials were equivocal. `` Neither guy won,'' said Republican Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, `` and neither guy lost.'' `` There was no knockout here,'' said political commentator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, former communications director for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up points on policy issues. I thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was smoother on presentation and reached out effectively to the middle class.'' On balance, <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to succeed in further delineating his ideological differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while the Democrat scored with economically struggling voters. `` I do n't think this will swing it,'' he said `` I do think this will make it a more competitive race.'' Many Republicans put greater emphasis on the ideological issue, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeded in portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as too liberal for most voters. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a mission and he can say mission accomplished,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who lost the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` He documented again and again that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Ted </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> liberal _ and that means someone who's out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Democrats, however, took the position that their nominee had widened his appeal. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won decisively in terms of picking up political support. He came across as assured, confident and clear on the facts,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who lost his party's nomination to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said, `` seemed befuddled and confused.'' But <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> professor who studies speeches, scored five topics for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, four for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and three a tie. `` If you believe that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had to score some kind of knockout or create some kind of major error on the part of the vice president, it did not occur,'' he said. Some viewers considered style rather than issues. Psychologist <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brothers </PERSON> rated the candidates on everything from using their hands for emphasis _ advantage <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ to appearing relaxed, a score for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did much better when the camera caught him accidentally. He is the master of the ironic smile,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was caught making notes, like a professor. That's a minus. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the better master of the pause.'' <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, a speech consultant who is author of `` Talk to Win,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` came across a lot weaker than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looks presidential, but he needs to hold his head up straighter,'' she said. `` He made impressive recovery when he made an error. It made a big difference for him to drop his voice. The wimp factor is finally gone.'' There were complaints from some quarters about the coaching undergone by both participants. `` Both candidates were pretty well programmed,'' said Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. `` We saw a little window into the candidates tonight, but not enough.'' `` Both gave somewhat canned responses,'' agreed a Republican <PERSON> Louisianan </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>. As a result, not all observers were thrilled by the performances. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, called the debate `` pretty mundane,'' and to Democrat <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, speaker of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assembly </LOCATION>, `` It was rather boring.'' Others drew more dramatic evaluations: _ Sen <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the Democratic leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: `` Tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' _ Republican Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: `` I believe <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did what he had to do to win the election He came across as being more of a leader and more of a real person.'' _ Sen <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, R-N.Y.: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had to do well, and I think this will clearly be the opportunity <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost. The vice president has fended him off.'' _ Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> clearly advanced his campaign dramatically. He appeared knowledgeable, decisive, cool, presidential. He won.'' _ <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the television evangelist who ran against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the Republican nomination for president: `` On the important issues of taxation, strong defense and law and order, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a clear winner. _ <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a member: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> during the debate was `` a descent into mudslinging of a kind we have not seen in my lifetime.

 Soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is in trouble with the law again. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> faced numerous charges, including assault and battery with intent to kill, after leading police on a chase that began <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION>, ran into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and back into <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` The Godfather of Soul'' was released after posting a total of $ 25,298 in bonds in both states late Saturday. He was arrested again on Sunday, less than 10 hours later, this time on a drunken driving charge, police said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was released on $ 1,219 bond after being charged with driving under the influence, driving while his license was suspended and improper movement on the roadway, said <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> C.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. In the earlier encounter with the law, a half-hour chase ended when police shot out the tires on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s pickup truck. He drove six miles on wheel rims before winding up in a ditch, police said. The incident began when <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 55, walked into an insurance seminar Saturday armed with a shotgun and a pistol, ordered everyone to leave the room and `` escorted'' some women outside to lock the restrooms, police said. During the chase, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> tried to ram police cars with his pickup truck, said Sgt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON>, said the singer is on medication for jaw surgery. `` He's in pain. ... He's not in his right mind,'' she said. On July 21, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was sentenced to 2 -LCB- years of suspended jail time, fined $ 1,200 and placed on probation until he performs a benefit concert after pleading no contest to possession of the drug PCP and guilty to a charge of resisting arrest and a weapons charge.

<BYLINE>But Did It Play in Peoria?

<TEXT>
 Here's how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> played in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scored big for his position on drugs, his vice presidential experience and desire to return to `` fundamental values.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won points for his criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings with `` drug-running Panamanian dictators,'' international terrorists and advocacy of programs for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s homeless. One hundred voters _ selected at random _ took part in an instantaneous electronic survey of their reactions as they watched <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> debate on television Sunday night. `` It's clear from the audience here that neither candidate hit a home run with their remarks,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who coordinated the opinion survey experiment for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, research firm. The group was assembled at a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> hotel and hooked to computers through an electronic monitoring system that allowed minute-by-minute monitoring of their opinions. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> area was chosen for the audience survey because <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is a pivotal state in the election. Before the debate, the group included 33 people leaning toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 41 leaning toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 26 undecided. After the debate, 36 said they were leaning toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 45 were leaning toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 19 were undecided. The debate reaffirmed <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s impressions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He's more personable and I think he has a better sense of values,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. `` I do n't care for Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ideas. He's too liberal.'' `` To me, quite honestly, he seems to be more for the average person,'' said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Impinto </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. She said the debate changed her preference from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Both candidates made gains,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, who developed the electronic system used to gauge the audience response. `` Each man pulled a segment of the undecided voters into their corners. Nobody lost any ground.'' Women generally responded more strongly to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It demonstrated vividly the gender gap,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` The men in our audience were resonating to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. More dramatically, the women were responding much more positively to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It was highly significant, statistically.'' `` I was also struck by the phenomenal lack of response to the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> issue,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I interpreted that to mean a lot of them are withholding judgment until the vice presidential debate.''

<HEAD>Bishops Call For Disarming Tonton Macoutes, Purging Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Taking a tough new stand, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have advocated disarming the ruthless private army of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime and banning the dictatorship's collaborators from civil service `` We insist on this justice to break the hellish circle of hate and vengeance,'' the 10-member <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s council said Sunday in its first reaction to the week-old soldier's rebellion. In an unsually strong statement broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, the bishops addressed `` a solemn appeal to all Haitians to take seriously this moment which, led according to the principles of the Gospel and the social teachings of the church, can lead to a veritable liberation.'' The bishops said the people wanted a change in the system when, through massive demonstrations, they forced <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> to flee to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986, ending his family's 29-year dictatorship. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> then became de facto ruler of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> until Sept. 17, when he was ousted by enlisted men of the Presidential Guard and replaced by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> collaborator. Much of the recent violence in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> targeting civilian opponents of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule was carried out by thugs who at one time belonged to the Tonton Macoutes, the dreaded private militia of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime. The rebels have ousted military commanders who tolerated the violence and there have been reprisal killings of people associated with the Macoutes. In their statement, the bishops called for `` a policy of elimination of Macoutism and a plan for the salvage of the nation.'' `` This policy entails the general disarming of Macoutes and the exclusion from the civil service of all those who in one way or another actively contributed to the consolidation and perpetuation of the dictatorial system during the last 30 years,'' the bishops said. It was not immediately clear whether the bishops were including <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> in their refernce to <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> collaborators. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was a financial adviser and close friend of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and also served under the dictator's father, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. The bishops called for the creation of an impartial judiciary and urged unspecified `` international organizations'' to increase assistance to this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> cut off aid after thugs attacked and killed at least 34 voters in thwarting November 1987 balloting that would have been <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free elections in 30 years. The church has always exerted a strong influence over the Haitian populace, which is 90 percent <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and was a crucial supporter of the demonstrations that led to the end of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> rule. <PERSON> Laennec </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurbon </PERSON>, a sociologist and author of books on Haitian culture, called the bishops' statement `` a break with the past policies of the church.'' <PERSON> Hurbon </PERSON>, who is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said the bishops recognized that national reconciliation is not possible unlces Macoutism is eradicated. Some 3,000 Roman Catholics, meanwhile, spilled out of the auditorium of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday for a service to mourn victims of a Sept. 11 massacre at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and to celebrate the military uprising. The Rev. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sele </PERSON> referred in a sermon to the rank-and-file troops who led the coup as `` our soldiers'' and denounced the slaughter that left 13 people dead and more than 70 wounded at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. After the Mass, about 1,500 people, including 150 survivors of the massacre, marched more than seven miles to a suburban church school, where they were greeted by the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. It was <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s first public appearance since escaping the massacre. `` God is with us. We do n't lose courage. The cleaning up has just begun,'' he said in a barely audible voice as the throng erupted in cheers. Two women shouted, `` He's alive, he's alive.'' <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a frequent target of assassination by the Macoutes, was an outspoken critic of the <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> government.

<TEXT>
 Concern over the health of ailing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> dampened trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen. The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gyrated through the day over concern for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose condition appeared to stabilize today after setbacks over the weekend. The Nikkei lost 59.17 points, or 0.22 percent, to close at 27,330.95 in dull trading. Volume on the first section was a light 550 million shares. Traders said investors were reluctant to take large positions because of fears the market might close temporarily upon <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s passing, leaving them unable to respond to financial markets overseas In addition, many traders cited the psychological impact of uncertainty over the health of any major world figure. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has reigned for nearly 62 years. Monday was also the last day Japanese brokerages could trade on their accounts for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, when most companies close their books. On the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 134.73 yen, up 0.26 yen from Thursday's close, the last day of trading. It opened at 134.80 yen and moved in a narrow range of 134.66-134 .85 yen Dealers attributed the dollar's strength to a reaffirmation over the weekend among monetary authorities from seven major countries. The Group of Seven met in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and decided to continue to coordinate economic policies targeting stable exchange rates and containing inflation. `` Following the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting, the market took it as an indication there will be no market intervention by the nation's central bank at the current exchange rate level,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking anonymously.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Million Africans Reported Undernourished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 100 million Africans, or one in four, do not get enough food to fuel an active working life, and the situation is getting worse, a new <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> report says. `` In the 1980s ... both the proportion and the total number of Africans with deficient diets have climbed _ and will continue to rise unless special action is taken,'' the study says. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>, the bank's vice president for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, released the report Sunday. He told a news conference that production of food grains on the continent has been declining for two decades. The study says 103.7 million Africans are among the `` food insecure'' _ those who do not get the minimum of 2,200 calories a day that people need to be able to work. It lists communist <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, buffeted by wars and drought, as having the largest number: 14.7 million, or nearly half its population. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is followed by <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> with 13.7 million and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> with 12 million. Both countries have close ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> have higher percentages of food insecure, but their population is smaller. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the best off among the 36 countries listed, with only 4 percent of its population, about 1.7 million, in the category. In some places food may be scarce, but more often people just do not have the money to buy it, said <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is the poorest country on the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s list, with average income estimated at $ 120 a year, less than 35 cents a day. The report calls for action so that within five years, half to two-thirds of the countries south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> will have carried out programs to cover a majority of the region's most needy. But <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON> said it would be futile to propose anything so specific as abolishing hunger `` by the year X.'' He said billions of dollars have been spent on aid for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but the programs have not worked well. He said many solutions do not need new aid money. One of those is for African governments to pay higher prices to African farmers, he said. He said the bank had completed negotiations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> that will give farmers more incentives and reduce state confiscation of crops, which he said started before the present government took power. But food security does not mean that every African country should grow all its own food, he said. `` If a farmer in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> makes $ 8 a day growing cotton, which nobody can eat, there's no point in his growing maize at $ 2 a day,'' he said. <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON> said some African governments pay their own farmers too little, which discourages them from producing. The governments then buy food from abroad and subsidize its sale in the towns. He said these policies are worse than the policies of wealthier countries in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where governments sell their surplus food cheap to benefit their own farmers at the expense of the taxpayer. <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON> said the African policies encourage people to shift to rice and wheat, which are uneconomical to grow in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, away from the sorghum and maize that their farmers traditionally have raised.

<HEAD>Skeletons Out of the Closet in Swindall-Jones Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The political skeletons were out of the closet long before Halloween here in the congressional race between Republican Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and Democratic nominee <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The congressman, with hidden tape recorders running, discussed financing his million-dollar home with laundered drug money. And <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who appeared on the television series `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' admits to `` wild'' drunken behavior and a conviction for assaulting his wife. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> asked for forgiveness, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> for understanding. Neither has much for the other. `` He beat his wife,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 47, said at one point, elaborating at a debate that it was `` your second of four wives.'' `` Being called dishonest by you is like being called ugly by a possum,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 46, of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s charge that he changed his story about his criminal record. `` I'll have to say it's the most bitter personal attacks I've seen in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> politics in 35 or 40 years,'' said the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> McWhorter </PERSON> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> called it `` a contest between two dirty candidates.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> blundered by failing to let <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> simply be haunted by the house issue, <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. Instead, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> reacted angrily when <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> grabbed headlines the night <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> won the Democratic primary by demanding to see <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' arrest record. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> suggested both take a drug test. There have been no drug tests, but the ensuing argument gave <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> a chance to swear he had never used drugs and forced <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to admit he smoked marijuana in the 1970s. <PERSON> McWhorter </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> still holds the edge, although <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> should benefit from being on the ballot with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the Republican-leaning district, made up mostly of east <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburbs. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> first squared off in 1986, with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> winning election to his second two-year term. But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' 47 percent showing was a surprise for a candidate who began the race with less name recognition than <PERSON> Cooter </PERSON>, the character he played on television. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said at the outset that he was an alcoholic who was frequently in trouble until he kicked the bottle in 1977. In the current race, he said the trouble included an incident in which he shoved his wife in a bar. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he was convicted of a misdemeanor assault charge, but originally forgot the outcome. He made <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s house an issue in the first race, suggesting <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was getting a sweetheart deal from a politically conservative contractor. But the price of the house grew to $ 1.2 million, and <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> last year turned to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> for help in financing it. When <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> was indicted for money laundering, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> acknowledged he once accepted a $ 150,000 check from LeChasney. He said he returned it uncashed because he became suspicious. The matter became the campaign's commanding issue when recordings of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s conversations with <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and a shady financier _ who turned out to be an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent _ were leaked in June. `` I can only draw the conclusion that certainly there are drugs involved and I can understand if you want to walk away,'' the agent told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in a tape-recorded meeting Sept. 13, 1987. `` I'd say this: first and foremost it becomes <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' problem,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> answered `` What I have to say is I borrowed money from -LRB- LeChasney's company -RRB-,'' he added. `` And frankly I do n't think it's incumbent upon me to go out and find out where <ORGANIZATION> XYZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gets their money,'' he said in the recording. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he had made an error in judgment and asked for forgiveness. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the tapes proved <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s dishonesty. But he now says he wants to quit talking about personal issues, saying he `` overreacted'' by suggesting the drug tests and now wants to focus on national issues. `` I have sinned, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, and so have you,'' he said at a debate.

<HEAD>In Remembering Babi Yar Slaughter, Jews Also Attack Soviet Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an officially sanctioned event unthinkable before the era of glasnost, hundreds of people gathered at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cemetery to remember more than 100,000 people, mostly Jews, massacred by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> at a ravine near <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. And some directed their anger not at the Germans but at the Soviet government for its repression of Jews. `` <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the Jewish people of our country,'' <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON>, a World War II veteran, told at least 500 people huddled Sunday on a road outside the gates of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Vostryakov Cemetery. A few years ago, police would have broken up such a demonstration as an anti-Soviet outpouring of nationalism. But in a product of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, only a few policemen were on hand and did not interfere. Standing alongside <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> activists atop a makeshift speakers platform on a truck were a prominent Jewish Soviet army general, the head of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and members of parliament. The rally, which lasted 1 -LCB- hours, was called by the official <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which includes Soviet Jews who oppose <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and by the unofficial Society for Friendship and Relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It was the second year that authorities gave permission for a <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> memorial rally in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but the first in which a state organization was a co-sponsor. In a sign of official sanction, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> ran an announcement of the ceremony on Thursday, and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency carried a dispatch after the demonstration. `` You must agree that some democracy exists because 10 years ago you could n't have met here,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> told the crowd in a mixture of Yiddish and English. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> and Health Employees. The rally marked the 47th anniversary of the killing of more than 100,000 people, mainly Jews, at <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> in the Ukrainian capital. Speakers said that shortly after occupying <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> rounded up and shot to death 35,000 Jews on Sept. 29-30, 1941. Pictures of women and children concentration camp prisoners, people hanging from gallows and piles of corpses were nailed onto the side of the truck. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rabbi led the crowd, assembled on the first night of the Jewish holiday Sukkot, in a Hebrew prayer of mourning for the massacre victims. Several speakers reminded the crowd that the suffering and repression of Jews did not end when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were defeated. `` After the war, members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee were shot, there was the ` Doctors Plot' and they wanted to deport the Jews to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherbaum </PERSON>, secretary of the friendship society. Dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> accused some of the country's top physicians, most Jewish, of being spies and trying to kill <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders. He had them arrested in 1953. <PERSON> Sherbaum </PERSON> said repression of Jews did not stop after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died that year. Even under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Jewish cemeteries have been destroyed in several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities, Jews are not permitted to organize classes to study Hebrew or Yiddish and unsanctioned Jewish organizations are denied meeting places, he told the crowd. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, a Jew refused permission to emigrate, said the government still publishes anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist literature. Other speakers charged that the Pamyat organization, an unofficial <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> political group that has sprung up under glasnost, was reviving the anti-Semitism symbolized by the <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> massacre through its racist ultra-nationalist views. For years, authorities arrested and harrassed Jews agitating for preservation of <PERSON> Babi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yar </PERSON> as a symbol of the Holocaust. After poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> wrote a poem about the massacre deploring the lack of a memorial, authorities relented and a monument was erected in 1976 on the swampy ravine. But many Jews have remained unsatisfied because the monument's plaque does not mention that most victims were Jews Among those at Sunday's rally sharing that view was a member of the first Israeli diplomatic delegation to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> severed ties with the Jewish state in 1967. `` It's very painful that there is not one word mentioning that Jews were killed there,'' said <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorev </PERSON>, who attended the ceremony with his wife <PERSON> Hasia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Kedmi </PERSON>, another member of the six-member <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> team that arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> July 28.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Yellowstone National Park superintendent, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> has endured a political, emotional and ecological firestorm. Because of the summer blaze that ravaged much of the oldest national park, his once-bright future seems as cloudy as the pall of smoke over <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, where fires continue to smolder. A 30-year <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> veteran who rose through the ranks, the 52-year-old <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> holds a highly visible, prestigious post. In June, he played host to park service Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, a score of dignitaries and nearly 400 of his peers and others, as he presided over the first general superintendents' conference in 12 years During the four-day meeting, gossip buzzed that if the next president looked toward the career ranks for his new director, <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> had a strong chance of heading the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But that preceded three months of flames and political flak, insults and cartoon caricatures. `` I have the best job in the world,'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said in an interview, using his standard line since he became overseer of the 2.2 million-acre park in 1983. But in a season of drought and flames around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, it is almost a throwaway line, a touch of bravado wedged between a defense of park policies and a recitation of climatological conditions that surprised his seasoned scientists. At the center of the controversy is the park service's policy of allowing naturally caused fires to burn as long as they do n't threaten life, property or historic sites `` By anybody's reckoning these fires are a catastrophe because of the impact and the anguish they caused,'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said. `` One million acres burned, threats to communities, power lines burning down, millions and millions of dollars being spent ... No one would promote something like that, for heaven's sake. `` But the Catch-22 ... is that if we say ` Look it, there's another side to this,' that statement is confused with a celebration of the fire and its impact `` Yellowstone Park is still all here. There will be a changed face to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, but not a devastated face, not a destroyed face _ that's just folly, that's myth. What there will be is just a different face. This event provides a great educational opportunity to see what a powerful force like fire can do, and how the land responds to it.'' Some of the physical strain of 20-hour days, no time off in months and unceasing criticism of park service policies shows in <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>'s set jaw and grim tone. He has become the focus for much of the anger and frustration stemming from the fires. <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> says such a reaction has left him `` dismayed but not necessarily surprised ... I do n't like it.'' Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has called the firefighting policy a `` disaster.'' <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, both Republicans, have attacked the `` let-it-burn'' policy, with <ORGANIZATION> Wallop </ORGANIZATION> suggesting <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> should be fired. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., has called for congressional oversight hearings about the origins of the fires and the way they were fought No one knows better than <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> that he's become the butt of jokes in the communities that ring the park and depend on it for economic survival. `` Did you hear that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> had a fire in his kitchen?'' goes one such joke. `` No, how did he put it out? `` He started a backfire in the living room.'' `` What are the fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> called?'' begins another. `` Why, they're called Bar-bee-ques.'' And then there are the newspaper cartoons depicting drooping bears with singed fur and a caption identifying them as `` Barbee Dolls.'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> has stressed repeatedly that he did not make day-to-day firefighting decisions, but added, `` I clearly, because I am sitting here, am responsible, and I accept that.'' And he expects the controversy the blazes have ignited to continue for months to come. `` Yellowstone draws fire because it is the ` <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>,' it has a symbolic aura about it,'' <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON> said. `` We who care for it have a sort of sacred charge. People here take it seriously, and they do n't like being maligned for not taking it seriously.''

 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and surrounding areas shook for almost half a minute today as a strong earthquake struck east of the capital. Police said there were no immediate signs of serious injuries or damage. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials said the temblor hit at 5:23 p.m. -LRB- 4:23 a.m. EDT -RRB- and registered a preliminary 5.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the scale is considered severe and capable of widespread damage near its center. `` We felt it very strongly. It lasted about 20 seconds, but there have n't been any reports of injuries,'' said a police officer in <LOCATION> Choshi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s neighboring <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> prefecture. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The meteorological agency said the earthquake's center was located off the eastern coast of <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> about 30 miles below the seabed. The agency said the quake registered four in <LOCATION> Choshi </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> earthquake scale _ intense enough to shake buildings strongly and overturn unstable objects. It measured three in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mito </ORGANIZATION> on the scale, which has a maximum reading of seven and measures ground motion at particular locations. In contrast, the open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake, and is not convertible to the Japanese scale.

<HEAD>Burma's Ruling Party Changes Its Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military-dominated political party that has ruled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for a quarter century gave itself a new name today in what one diplomat described as an attempt to change the party's tarnished image. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is now the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It did not give an explanation for the change, but a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, described the move as an attempt `` to change their image -LRB- and -RRB- make a break with the past.'' In recent months, millions of people have engaged in street demonstrations, strikes and other acts of opposition to the party and the 26 years of political repression and economic decline associated with it. Military commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> led a coup Sept. 19 that diplomats say apparently has re-established effective control over the country by the ruling clique. Soldiers have driven protesters from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s streets and broken up protest centers in dozens of towns nationwide. The government says security forces have killed more than 250 civilians, mostly people described as looters, since the coup. Diplomats believe more have died, including many unarmed demonstrators who marched the day after the coup. In the latest incidents reported by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION>, security forces shot and killed 12 people Sunday in looting incidents as lawlessness persisted a week after <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took over. The radio said five people also were wounded and 16 arrested in five incidents in the capital in which looters were trying to steal rice, gasoline and corrugated iron sheets. In the bloodiest incident, security forces shot and killed seven people who were among a crowd of 100 looters Sunday night at the state-owned Five Star Shipping Line near <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the radio said. It said two others were killed when security forces dispersed a mob of 1,000 people looting a government rice warehouse, and three died while looting another government warehouse. The main anti-government activity currently is a general strike that began Aug. 8 and has paralyzed the government administration. Authorities have ordered civil servants back to work by Oct. 3. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has pledged to hold multiparty elections once peace is restored to the impoverished nation, but he has set no timetable. The last such elections were in held in 1960, two years before leader <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> seized power in a military coup. Three key opposition leaders _ <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, Tin Oo and <ORGANIZATION> Aung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kyi </ORGANIZATION> _ on Saturday formed an umbrella group to unite the millions of students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, government workers and others struggling for democracy. Although the opposition has not formally responded to <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s plan for elections, it earlier opposed a snap election because said the ruling autocracy could not be trusted to hold fair and free balloting. Opposition leaders also said such elections would have been unfair because the longstanding ban on political parties other than the ruling party was only recently lifted. They have urged formation of a non-partisan interim government to conduct the elections. The government earlier this month ordered civil servants and all military personnel to resign from the ruling party and repealed the law authorizing financial support to the party from the government. But the party, which had 2.5 million members before the unrest and susequent resignations, remains a potent force with offices throughout this nation of 38 million people. The party has been the personal fiefdom of 77-year-old Ne Win, who led <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into isolation during his 26 years of rule and made the resource-rich nation one of the world's poorest countries. Current leader <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> is believed to have strong links to Ne Win. Government news releases first issued last week said <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s official name was changed back to what it was before 1962 _ from the `` Socialist Republic of the Union of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'' to the `` Union of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Millions of red and gray locusts darkened the sky over <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> for 90 minutes this morning, some landing on cultivated fields along the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to devour the crops. Huge swarms of the insects began arriving about 7:30 a.m. and left at about 9 a.m. The sun was completely covered for almost half an hour of the 1 -LCB- - hour period Officials had no immediate estimate of the size of the swarm, which came in from the east and moved in a westerly direction, or the amount of damage it left behind. Torrential rains caused disastrous flooding in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> last month, and experts said the greening of normally barren desert areas created perfect breeding grounds for locusts. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister el-Fatih el-Tigani said <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s locust threat had entered `` a critical stage.'' He said that the government had destroyed half of about 60 potential swarms in the country but that <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> lacked sufficient insecticides or equipment to spray all agriclutural lands facing an invasion. Swarms are known to be mainly in eastern and western <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> lies at the center of the country. Officials fear that locusts could leave behind more devastation than last month's flooding, which caused damage estimated at $ 330 million or more.

 Vandals defaced a museum honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Junipero </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> with such spray-painted slogans as `` Genocidal Maniac'' for his alleged mistreatment of Indians as others protested at the 18th century monk's grave. The graffiti marred ceremonies Sunday at Presidio Park honoring <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> priest revered as the founder of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s missions, on the day he was beatified by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Vandals spray-painted slogans including `` Murderous Lying Scum'' and `` <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> was a Baby Killer'' on the doors and sides of the <LOCATION> Serra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> and other walls and memorials in the 40-acre park. In the northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, about 20 Indians held a protest prayer vigil at Serra's grave Sunday. `` We want to show we're against this because of the brutality that occurred when <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> had control of the missions,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, chairman of the Costanoan band of local Indians. Carrying an abalone shell filled with burning sage, a variety of feathers and shell ornaments and a dried gourd that was beat to mark cadence, the Indians entered the Carmel Mission between morning Masses. One of about 200 parishioners inside yelled, `` Take your pagan rites out of the church.'' When the prayer was finished, the protesters left the church and resumed a demonstration at the gates of the mission. Several were weeping. Museum officials here said the graffiti, which colored a bronze likeness of <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, a bronze statue of an Indian and a 50-foot stone cross, will cost hundreds of dollars to repair. `` It's a shame that they chose this method of protesting. That sort of thing does n't help anything and certainly is not going to change the church's position,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitre </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION>. About 30 protestors who attended a rally later denied involvement in the vandalism. Police said they had no suspects. The graffiti, including obscenities, attacked <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> for greed, racism and anti-Semitism, as well as cruelty to Indians. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>'s critics say he whipped and enslaved the Indians he worked to convert, stole their lands, and exposed them to European diseases to which they had no resistance. `` He should n't be honored,'' said protestor <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, an Indian descendant. `` Serra had the arrogance of any missionary effort of coming to a people that already had a religion and trying to impose their European religion.'' In ceremonies moving <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> toward sainthood, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> called the Franciscan monk, `` a shining example of Christian virtue and the missionary spirit.'' Built in 1769, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> mission was the first in a series of missions along the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast whose construction was organized by <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>. `` It saddens and angers me,'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, education coordinator for the <LOCATION> Serra </LOCATION> museum, said of the graffiti. `` There's no proof whatsoever that <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> mistreated anyone. A group of nine historians that investigated the issue for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> last year reported that Indians were abused in the missions but found no evidence to support charges against <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> himself.

 An 18th century monk who founded <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s first missions and a priest executed by a firing squad in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1927 moved a step closer to sainthood when they were beatified by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The monk beatified Sunday, the Rev. <PERSON> Junipero </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, founded nine missions in what is now <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But critics say he whipped and enslaved the very native Americans he worked to convert. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, demonstrations were held against the Franciscan's beatification, including a protest by his graveside in <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> and the defacing of a museum in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> was one of six people the pope beatified during a three-hour Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square. In the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, beatification is one step from possible sainthood. Some Indians claim <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> stole their lands, destroyed their culture, forced their ancestors to work in fields or on construction projects and exposed them to European diseases against which they had no resistance. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, speaking in English, said <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> was `` a shining example of Christian virtue and the missionary spirit. `` His great goal was to bring the Gospel to the native peoples of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, so that they too might be ` consecrated in the truth,''' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` It was a field of missionary endeavor that required patience, perseverance and humility, as well as vision and courage.'' In <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> on Sunday, about 20 Indians entered the chapel at the <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> mission between <LOCATION> Masses </LOCATION> and, standing in a semi-circle around <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>'s grave, prayed aloud for the souls of the 2,364 Indians buried at the mission. `` We want to show we're against this because of the brutality that occurred when <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> had control of the missions,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, chairman of the Costanoan band of local Indians. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> early Sunday, vandals defaced a museum honoring <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, marring ceremonies marking his day of beatification. They spray-painted such slogans as `` Genocidal Maniac'' and `` <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> was a Baby Killer'' on the doors and sides of the museum. Among those taking part in the <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> celebrated before more than 20,000 people were 5-year-old AIDS sufferer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and Sister <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a 30-year-old nun from <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> who has incurable cancer. Both have prayed that <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>'s intercession will save their lives. Also beatified Sunday was the Rev. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pro </PERSON>, a Jesuit priest shot by a Mexican firing squad 61 years ago. The only martyr among the six beatified, he was killed at the height of the conflict between the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the anti-clerical revolutionary government. Although he denied it, Pro was accused of taking part in a plot to kill Mexican strongman Gen. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON>. He was executed without trial on orders of President <PERSON> Plutarco </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calles </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New Plan Could Lower Surgeons' Pay, Raise Internists'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pay of some highly specialized surgeons will drop sharply while internists and others on medicine's front lines will earn more under a proposed new physician fee structure drawn up for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, its author says. The results of the 2 -LCB- - year project, called the resource-based relative value scale, are to be published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine and released by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Its chief architect, economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan is intended to correct `` distorted and inequitable'' fees that pay doctors too little for examining patients and too much for specific procedures and operations. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s project attempts to determine the amount of work involved in everything doctors do _ from checkups to brain surgery _ so they can be paid what their services are worth. If accepted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which requested it, the plan will be used to set the pay for doctors who treat elderly Medicare patients. It may also be adopted by state-run Medicaid programs and private insurance companies. `` In general, some of the primary-care specialties will rise, and a few of the highly specialized surgical specialties may see a sharp drop in fees for their services,'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But the impact will not be uniform. Some specialties will not be affected very much.'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said that if adopted by government health agencies and insurance companies, his 2,000-page plan could have a profound effect on the nation's health care system. Among other things, it could: _ improve care by encouraging doctors to spend more time with their patients _ lower medical costs by discouraging expensive tests, procedures and operations _ increase the number of doctors willing to specialize in family practice and other kinds of primary care _ lower the income of some surgical specialists while raising the pay of physicians who provide general care to patients `` This is going to be a very important piece of work that we hope will rationalize the manner in which physicians are paid,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, senior deputy executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Not all doctors would make the same pay under the system, because some have more demanding jobs than others. `` An orthopedic surgeon, under this fee system, will be justifiably making more than pediatricians,'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said. `` They will receive different levels of compensation according to their level of work.'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> declined to reveal specifics of his report until it is formally published, but outlined some of the major conclusions and described the effect he believes it could have on medicine. Traditionally, doctors have been paid relatively little for seeing patients in their offices, monitoring them and writing prescriptions. However, they are often highly paid for diagnostic tests and such procedures as installing pacemakers. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s plan would narrow this gap. He believes that without a strong financial incentive, doctors will do fewer questionable procedures. `` There could be a change in the quality of patient care,'' he said. `` Physicians will be willing to spend more time with patients and treat them as a whole person.''

<HEAD>IMF Calls For Forceful Action to Help Third World Debtors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said today that more forceful action is needed to help heavily indebted Third World countries. `` Many countries continue to face severe financing and adjustment difficulties, which have become more severe due to the recent increase in interest rates,'' said a statement issued by finance ministers from 22 countries at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` More forceful actions are needed in the context of the current cooperative, case-by-case approach to resolve these difficulties,'' the statement said. Poor countries have been pressing for more help from industrialized nations and bankers to ease their staggering debt burdens. The panel urged debtor countries to continue making changes in their economic policies to spur growth. It also urged banks `` to provide adequate refinancing and not only rescheduling of amortization payments.'' Banks have been reluctant to lend the debtor nations more money and have instead agreed in some cases to stretch out payment terms. The panel came out strongly against shifting to governments the risks taken by commercial bankers in Third World lending. Because of doubt about the ability of debtors to repay, banks holding the debt have to take sharp losses when they resell. The World Bank deals with the long-term development of Third World countries. The fund was set up to handle shorter-term problems. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> da <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> told other finance chiefs that industrialized nations should launch a `` direct attack'' on the economic troubles of developing countries. `` It is clear that growth in industrial countries does not trickle down to developing countries' economies,'' <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said. The debt of developing countries is one of the key topics at the meeting, which began last week and will run through Thursday. Some 12,000 financial officials, bankers and journalists planned to attend. Officials of the seven key industrialized nations have already given final approval to a plan to help the world's poorest countries, mostly in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s large debtors would like more help with their problems. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> owes $ 121 billion in foreign loans, making it the developing world's No. 1 debtor. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> follows with about $ 104 billion in debts. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major industrialized nations have said the money problems of the `` middle-income'' debtors, such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, should be handled on a case-by-case basis, a strategy fashioned in recent years. On Sunday, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chancellor of the exchequer, and West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> both urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to trim its federal budget deficit. `` The absorption by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, for a further long period, of a sizable share of the world's net savings would not be in anyone's interest,'' said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the conference did not release remarks of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in the private meetings. But non-U.S. sources who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as assuring his financial counterparts that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> placed the `` highest priority'' on efforts to reduce red-ink spending.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> continued to bleed internally and his temperature rose today, a week after his condition suddenly deteriorated, but officials said the 87-year-old monarch's health was stable. <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said doctors gave the world's longest-reigning monarch .43 pints of blood in a transfusion to compensate for that lost from his intestinal hemorrhage. He said the frail emperor was fully conscious today and had discharged `` slight traces of blood'' through his bowels during the night. Since he vomited blood one week ago, the emperor has through transfusions received a total of 5.96 pints. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> briefly watched television today, and conversed with Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Crown Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> when they visited. On Thursday, all the emperor's imperial duties were transferred to <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, who is heir to the throne. `` I have not seen him -LRB- today -RRB- myself, but my impression is that his condition is consistent and stable,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. `` But we have to remain alert.'' But he said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature had risen to 100 at midafternoon, up from 98.1 in the morning and well above his normal reading of about 95.9. The nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> today quoted medical experts as saying cancer was the likely cause of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s continuous discharge of blood Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny press reports that the emperor has cancer and instead have urged the Japanese media to refrain from speculation. Cancer is rarely acknowledged publicly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was well enough Sunday to watch on television as sumo wrestling champion <PERSON> Chiyonofuji </PERSON> won his 25th title in the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament. `` A perfect victory, is n't it,'' the emperor was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Chiyonofuji </PERSON>, along with other top wrestlers, called on the palace today to sign his name to a register wishing the emperor speedy recovery. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index gyrated today with varied reports of the emperor's condition. After early reports the emperor had received transfusions during the night, the index fell almost 160 points. It regained its losses after the palace said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was in stable condition, but ended the day down 56 points or 0.22 percent. <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kita </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said the market fluctuations indicated investors were still concerned about <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s health. A crowd of almost 800 people began gathering at the Imperial Palace after dawn under threatening skies as the nation's vigil entered a second week. As of Sunday, more than 300,000 had signed registries at the palace and at 11 other locations around the country wishing for the emperor's recovery, according to palace reports. The emperor, who ascended the throne in December 1926, has been under 24-hour medical supervision since vomiting blood a week ago. His condition took a turn for the worse Saturday when his fever soared to 102.6. By Sunday night, however, <PERSON> Shoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimori </PERSON>, grand steward of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters the crisis was over. Last year on Sept. 22, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> underwent a bypass operation after an inflamed pancreas put pressure on the duodenum. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported the emperor was suffering from pancreatic cancer and the respected <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news agency, quoting a biopsy report, said pathologists found evidence of cancer in tissue taken from the region between the pancreas and duodenum in last year's operation. Under the constitution, the emperor has no real power but signs documents and government appointments already approved by the government.

 A tentative contract agreement averted a strike by 1,200 <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> workers today, allowing thousands of commuters to get to work on time. `` Both sides compromised and compromised, and then we met _ sort of happily _ in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 790 </ORGANIZATION>, which represents janitors, mechanics and clerks. A ratification vote was set for Wednesday, and union leaders predicted approval. The key money issue in the contract dispute was whether <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> or its employees should benefit from an estimated $ 10 million-a-year windfall from investments from the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, to which <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> contributes. The old contract required the turning over of profits to the workers. <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> wanted two-thirds of the money to go toward operations. The tentative agreement announced Sunday calls for the profits to be used for three years to finance medical insurance for retired employees. The union agreed that members also would pay $ 15 per month toward the retirees' benefit. `` We're happy. They're happy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>. Local 790, which had been working without a contract since June, had set a strike time of 12:01 a.m. today. Local 1555 of the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 500 station agents and train operators, had promised to honor picket lines. The district had hoped to offer about half the normal train service, but only during certain hours of the day. Many of the 100,000 people who ride the 71-mile system to work and back each weekday had spent much of the weekend trying to find alternative ways to get to their jobs. At least one was set to go sailing _ to work. `` I'm planning to sail my boat to Fisherman's Wharf in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, let my wife sail the bay the rest of the day, and then have her pick us up after work,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> before the strike settlement was announced.

 Two civilian workers at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION> were killed when 350-degree steam filled the small tunnel where they were working, a spokesman said. The boiler technicians were trying to open a valve to return steam to a part of the shipyard Sunday morning when the utility tunnel filled with low-pressure steam that had leaked from a pipe, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, shipyard spokesman. `` The steam filled the area almost instantly and there was no chance of escape,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 28, both of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, entered the tunnel through a manhole at about 6:20 a.m., he said. About 40 minutes later, when co-workers realized the men were overdue, they tried to reach them by radio, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said.

 A minister who shot and killed a church handyman before beheading him and leaving the man's body in a burning church has been sentenced to death by electrocution. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 44, was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and arson in the slaying of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, 32, whose headless body was found in <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s burning church on June 16, 1987. The jury returned the death sentence against <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> on Sunday after 13 hours of debate and a brief church service. Defense attorney <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said, `` I normally do n't put that much stock in appeals, but I think we've got some genuine legal issues in this case.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s strongest ground for appeal is challenging whether the murder was committed in conjunction with a larceny, which the jury listed as one of two aggravating circumstances justifing the imposition of the death penalty, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> admitted misappropriating more than $ 30,000 in church funds, but <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> argued that it did not amount to larceny under the terms of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s felony murder statute. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> also admitted he killed <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, dressed the body in his own clothes and set the <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of Christ Oneness Pentecostal on fire in a scheme to fake his own death. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> wanted to start a new life and leave insurance proceeds to his family. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> cut off <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>'s head, part of an arm and patches of skin marked with tattoos and threw the body parts into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barkley </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> bought an additional $ 150,000 in life insurance in April 1987 and gathered false identification papers in the name of a boy who drowned in 1951.

<TEXT>
 An inmate who was identified in court papers as a police informant was killed in his cell while other prisoners went on a rampage, authorities said. The 3 -LCB- - hour uprising Sunday began when inmates refused to let two unarmed guards confiscate their homemade liquor Twenty minutes after authorities quelled the rampage, they discovered the body of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. The lawyer for <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, who faced a charge of aiding and abetting the murder of a drug informant, said authorities are to blame for <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' death because they made public his cooperation, and one prosecutor involved in the case said his identity was made public by mistake. `` I'm absolutely convinced he was killed because the prosecutors, contrary to the promise they made, went public with the fact that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> helped them,'' said attorney <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehne </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to speculate whether the rampage was staged as a diversion to cover up the killing. Guards left the area of the uprising about 3:15 p.m. for reinforcements. Inmates broke glass and burned mattresses and papers. When SWAT teams from several law enforcement agencies re-entered the building about 6:45 p.m., inmates left voluntarily and no force was needed, officials said. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeese </PERSON>, executive assistant to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, refused to release details on how <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> died. But he said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' killer got into the cell through a hole knocked in the cinder-block wall. In August, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 35, led police to the partially buried remains of a drug informant, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Nampa </LOCATION>. But his hopes of a plea-bargain fizzled when he failed a polygraph test. He was convicted of unrelated felony charges and also awaited trial on a charge of aiding and abetting murder. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> became an instant target when word spread that he had cooperated with authorities, <PERSON> Kehne </PERSON> said. Just Friday, <PERSON> Kehne </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> told him that he considered himself to be in danger. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> had said a handful of newspaper clippings detailing how he led police to Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' body, in hopes of making a deal, had been shoved into his cell, the lawyer said. Canyon County Prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he was shocked to discover that the sensitive information had been placed in the court file, accessible to reporters and other members of the public. He blamed the action on <LOCATION> Owyhee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasden </PERSON>. Both prosecutors were involved in the case. `` I was upset when I found out about it,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> added, `` but that's one of the problems you get when you have different agencies involved.'' <PERSON> Wasden </PERSON>, reached at his home Sunday night, declined to comment. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> refused to request protective custody because he did not want to spend several months before his trial in maximum-security, his lawyer said. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was accused of ordering two friends to kill Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 32, has been charged with first-degree murder, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wages </PERSON>, 36, has pleaded guilty to the same charge.

 A poll conducted in five key states shows Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with an edge over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but the lead was within the margin of error and the results could be regarded as a dead heat.

No presidential candidate in the 20th century has won without taking three of the five states polled, and many voters in those states were looking to Sunday's nationally televised debate to help them choose between the candidates. Overall, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 46 percent to 43 percent in the mid-September survey by pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the poll had a 3.5 percent margin of error. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by a comfortable 54 to 37 percent margin, and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> by 50 to 40 percent. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the vice president was ahead 46 to 43 percent, making the state a virtual tie because of the poll's 6 percent sampling error for the individual state statistics. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 48 to 40 percent, and in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 47 to 40 percent. Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they were likely to watch the debate, and 42 percent said they would `` definitely'' tune in, the newspaper reported. One-fourth said the 90-minute debate would be `` very important'' in helping them decide which candidate to vote for, and 18 percent said the joint appearance would be `` fairly important.''

<HEAD>Scientists Use Eye-Cell Transplants in Rats to Cure Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have taken a major step toward curing a disease that causes blindness, saving the eyesight of experimental rats by transplanting retinal cells in their eyes, according to a published report. Two groups of scientists have succeeded in performing the transplants and preventing a type of blindness in the rats, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The researchers said the procedure would have to be repeated on monkeys and other animals before it could be tried on human beings, the Times reported. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Retinitis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pigmentosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, degenerative diseases of the retina occur in 400,000 living Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Macular </ORGANIZATION> degeneration, one of these diseases, is the leading cause of blindness in this country in people over the age of 60. Sometimes doctors can slow the loss of vision in patients with these diseases but they have no way of preventing it. Before the scientists' findings could be applied to humans, the problem of tissue rejection will have to be overcome, the newspaper reported. The rats came from a special, inbred strain whose immune system accepts other tissue without attacking it. The experiments involved rats with an inherited defect in pigmented epithelial cells, which darken the pupil and allow light to pass through. These cells cover and nourish photoreceptor cells, which convert light to electrical signals that are interpreted by the brain. The pigmented epithelial cells also ingest excess photoreceptor cells. In the diseased rats, the pigmented epithelial cells die, which eventually leads to the death of the photoreceptor cells. To cure the disease before the photoreceptor cells died, the scientists cut slits in the back of the animals' eyes and injected tiny drops of fluid containing healthy cells into the area where the pigmented cells normally grow. The research was conducted by two groups working independently: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Linxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Li </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouras </PERSON> and his colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Turner has operated on more than 200 rats, the Times said. In every case, the transplanted cells survived and prevented the photoreceptor cells from dying. <PERSON> Gouras </PERSON> said he and his colleagues hoped to try the retinal cell transplants on monkeys next. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he would try them on rabbits and monkeys and would try implanting greater numbers of cells in rats.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> set the countdown clock ticking today for returning Americans to space on Thursday aboard the shuttle Discovery. `` The launch countdown is now in progress,'' test director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> announced promptly at 8 a.m. EDT as he signaled the traditional `` call to stations.'' That call assembled more than 100 controllers at their consoles. Early work included loading Discovery's computer software, servicing the main engines and other propulsion systems and removing work platforms from around the base of the spaceplane. `` We're looking forward to doing the shot and doing it right and launching on time,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlino </PERSON>, another test director, told a news conference shortly after the countdown began for the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space mission since Challenger exploded over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, killing the crew of seven, 32 months ago. Thursday's forecast was for scattered and broken clouds, a wind of 10-15 knots from the southeast, temperatures of 85 degrees and widely scattered showers. `` Given the constraints <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has, things look very, very good,'' said Senior Master Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> weather spokesman. The countdown had been set to begin at midnight but was postponed when launch pad workers fell behind in preparations Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that did not affect the goal of launching Discovery at 9:59 a.m. Thursday. `` We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's the plan,'' launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said Sunday The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had built 39 unprogrammed hours of contingency time into the countdown as insurance for last-minute problems. <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said it was decided Sunday to allot eight hours of that time to complete the work of replacing panels and removing work platforms from around Discovery's engine compartment. `` We do n't want those people to have to do that under the gun with the clock counting,'' he said. `` So we said, ` Take all the time it takes and we'll delay the call to stations to accommodate that.''' Closing out the aft end of the spaceplane had been held up when low voltage readings were detected in an electrical circuit that ignites the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from its fuel tank in flight. Engineers eventually determined the fault was in a ground circuit, which does not affect the flight. Discovery's five astronauts planned to fly here late this afternoon from their training base at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Once here, they will receive daily briefings on launch preparations, review their flight plan and undergo medical examinations. Commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, and pilot <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel, planned to practice landings at a runway here in a jet outfitted to handle like the shuttle. The three mission specialists in the crew are <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. All have flown on earlier shuttle flights. During four days in orbit they are to release a $ 100 million communications satellite from Discovery's cargo bay, conduct 11 science and technology experiments and check out modifications made to the shuttle since the Challenger accident. `` Because there are so many changes, we're treating it like a test flight of a new vehicle,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission that investigated the Challenger accident said the direct cause was a leak at a joint between two segments of one of Challenger's two solid-fuel booster rockets. Engineers redesigned the booster, and made improvements to the orbiter, the main engines and the external fuel tank. In all, 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones were made. The program to redesign all three shuttles has cost about $ 2.4 billion to date. The commission report said cold weather, 36 degrees at launch, contributed to the Challenger accident by stiffening O-rings in the joint, preventing them from sealing gaps properly. Some engineers had argued with lower-level managers against launching in the cold, but their concerns never were relayed to top managers who made the launch decision. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has changed procedures to make certain concerns of any agency or contractor employee are relayed to top management. And a <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, made up of 21 key <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and contractor managers and engineers, has been established to monitor the final two days of the countdown. The team is headed by astronaut <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, who has made four shuttle flights. With the help of team members, he will assemble all information in the final minutes of the count and will have sole authority to signal the decision to launch.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had one of their more feisty debate exchanges when discussing running mates, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declaring he had `` full confidence'' in <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scoffed at the prospect of `` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' The debate over running mates came late in the 90-minute clash Sunday night between Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not mentioned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at all before he was asked to explain his choice; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> twice before briefly had mentioned <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> when discussing his views on foreign policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in defending <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, praised the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's defense credentials and noted his leadership role in winning passage of a job training measure. `` I believe he will be outstanding,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who then said the media had subjected <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to `` outrageous'' and `` brutal'' scrutiny of his academic and military records. `` He has my full confidence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But the vice president also created an opening for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when, in an effort to paint the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as naive on foreign policy and defense, said there were three people on the Republican ticket who were well-versed in those areas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> obviously meant to say three people among the four candidates, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seized the opportunity. `` Did I sense a desire that maybe <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ought to be your running mate whe you said that the three people on your ticket?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to laughter from the audience at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, interviewed outside his suburban <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home Sunday night, said he was undisturbed by the questions that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised about his qualifications. `` When the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people come to know <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ... they will feel more comfortable,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` They've been told a lot of inaccuracies, a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had telephoned him after the debate and was `` very upbeat, for a very good reason.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was clearly victorious `` because he was able to depict <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as out of the mainstream.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who includes the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> selection in his attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment, used most of his rebuttal time after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on that track and to praise the experience and maturity of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. But he also delivered a biting criticism of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a second term senator who was little known nationally before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped him for the vice presidential spot in August. `` I doubt very much that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the best qualified person for that job,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' is a very, very troubling notion.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not criticize <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> but did attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for making fun, in his campaign appearances, of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s given name, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Do you know who <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> was?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked of his rival. `` He was a man that gave his life in World War II. So ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.''

<HEAD>Ozal To Remain Premier After Referendum Defeat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said today he would remain in office and continue to serve `` with vigor and enthusiasm'' even though Turkish voters rejected a referendum sponsored by his government. Opposition parties turned Sunday's proposed constitutional amendment _ which called for moving municipal elections from March 1989 to November of this year _ into a vote of confidence on <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and his free-market economic policies. The premier said earlier he would resign `` depending upon the outcome.'' With 86 percent of the votes counted, the state television reported early today that 65 percent of the 26.5 million eligible voters opposed the amendment and 35 percent were in favor of it. But <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said in a televised statement today that he would remain premier until the next general elections in 1992. He said he was satisfied with the result of the vote, since the number of `` yes'' votes were about the same as the 36 percent his <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won in general elections 10 months ago. The result gave the party a 290-seat majority in the 450-member Parliament. But opposition leaders <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former premier <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>, who heads the centrist <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said today's result was a defeat for the 61-year-old premier. `` He has not received the support he was seeking,'' said <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>. `` This government has been rejected by the people _ tomorrow there will be new political conditions in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Demirel </PERSON>. During the pre-referendum campaign, the opposition emphasized the country's 78 percent inflation, the rising foreign debt _ which doubled in the past five years to $ 42 billion _ and low wages. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> responded that under his tenure, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has enjoyed high economic growth, which has averaged an annual 7.5 percent in the past two years and is projected at 7.2 percent for 1988. He said the economic boom has brought <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> new housing, roads, dams, and communications systems. The premier called on voters to avoid returning to the turbulent decade that ended in a 1980 military takeover, which was accompanied by an economic crisis and political violence. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, who launched <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s economic recovery program as deputy premier under the military government, became premier when his party won in the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a Canadian company, <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, will form a joint venture to recycle discarded plastic for use in manufacturing, the companies said today. The new company, to be owned equally by <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION>, will take plastic soft-drink bottles, milk jugs and other waste consumer items and process them into raw materials to be used in making other products. `` We're confident that this joint venture will show that commercial recycling of plastics can be a profitable enterprise and an important part of the solution to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s solid-waste disposal problem,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Genson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s business director for solid-waste solutions. Plastics recycling is now limited mainly to industrial scrap, said Dow, which is based in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genson </PERSON> said the recycling venture will provide an alternative to landfills for disposal and so `` will help to preserve the environment and make better use of our resources. <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> will be principally responsible for collecting the waste plastic for recycling. The waste will be taken from existing collection centers, mainly in areas that have recycling laws, the companies said. The plastic reclaimed by the joint venture will be used by <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> in its manufacturing or sold by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> in resin to other industrial customers, the companies said. <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> now recycles waste paper in both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Initially, the joint venture will conduct a pilot-plant program to improve recycling technology. Full-scale commercial operation is expected to begin no sooner than 1990, the companies said. A decision on plant location remains to be made, they said.

<HEAD>Government Designates Neighborhoods To Be Integrated</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today for the first time publicly identified `` whites only'' neighborhoods that could be opened legally to people of all races. Tens of thousands of non-whites already live illegally in districts of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, which Constitutional Planning Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> cited as areas likely to be integrated. In a session of Parliament today, <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> reintroduced three bills under the Group Areas Act, which segregates all neighborhoods by race and sharply increases the penalties for violations of the act. The bills, viewed as an attempt to appease conservative white voters before the nationwide municipal elections on Oct. 26, were first introduced last month, but were withdrawn after anti-apartheid groups and black leaders condemned it. The new legislation, however, also proposes to legalize a limited number of multiracial neighborhoods that have developed in recent years as whites moved out of urban neighborhoods. The measure has been denounced by the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to makes gains in the elections at the expense of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Group Areas bills created a political furor in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month, when the white chamber approved them, but the mixed-race and Asian chambers boycotted parliamentary discussions in protest. The government withdrew the bills, but decided to reintroduce them after the two chambers agreed to end their boycott. `` When the colored -LRB- mixed-race -RRB- and Indian communities tell me that the Group Areas Act has hurt them, I say in all earnestness: ` I hear you,''' <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said today at a joint session of the three chambers. But <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said the government remained committed to protecting `` group rights'' _ a phrase for policies which allow whites-only schools, hospitals and residential areas. The mixed-race and Asian chambers are expected to reject all three bills, including the proposal to allow multiracial neighborhoods. Leaders of the chambers say the Group Areas Act should be repealed, rather than amended. However, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ which controls <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s white chamber _ has the power to enact the legislation even if the proposed bills are rejected by the other two chambers. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks are not represented in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and has not vote in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites. Among the areas mentioned by <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> as candidates for multiracial status were <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> neighborhoods and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s District Six, from which tens of thousands of mixed-race people were evicted in 1966 after it was designated for whites only. A surplus of housing in white urban neighborhoods is accompanied by a severe shortage of housing in non-white areas, and thousands of Asians, blacks and people of mixed race have been moving into districts vacated by whites. The Group Areas Act has been the most hotly contested issue in the municipal elections. The anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the only major white party that opposes the Group Areas Act, the most hotly contested issue in the municipal elections. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s city council said he would lobby for multiracial areas in wards that vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but would seek to keep other white neighborhoods segregated.

 An unemployed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> machinist said he was pleased that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned insurance problems facing the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> family in a nationally televised debate. `` I was kind of surprised,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, 42. `` It made me feel good in a way that issue was important enough to be mentioned on national TV in a debate,'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if it will sway any votes one way or another, but I know there are a lot of people like me.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, facing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a debate from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Sunday night, spoke of `` a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. `` He has an 11-year-old son and ca n't let that son compete in sports in Little League because he's afraid he's going to be hurt and he wo n't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> said he had not mentioned Little League baseball when he met with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and others in a forum on health insurance last week in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Instead, he had told the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of his son's desire to play football in school `` My son would like to participate in sports, but frankly, without insurance, I'm scared to death to let him play,'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the forum at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s Hermann hospital. `` If he'd get hurt, I could n't get any medical treatment for him.'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> said he and his wife were sad that they felt had to keep their son, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, off the playing field. But he said they had little choice because they would have to sign a release relieving the school of responsibility if <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> were injured. `` My wife is employed and insurance is available where she works, but the premiums are so high we ca n't afford it,'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> said. `` We're scraping now to pay off the house notes and the utilities.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> and his son while discussing his proposal that the federal government require businesses to provide health insurance for employees.

 A Sicilian magistrate who sentenced two Mafia bosses to life imprisonment was ambushed and killed along with this 35-year-old son, police said today. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>, 66, and his son <PERSON> Stefano </PERSON> were killed by gunmen who stopped their car on a road outside <LOCATION> Caltanisetta </LOCATION> as they drove home Sunday night, police said. Investigators said the ambush appeared to be a Mafia vendetta for the 1985 sentencing of brothers <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> was the presiding judge at the trial of the <ORGANIZATION> Grecos </ORGANIZATION>, described as the bosses of a powerful Mafia ring. <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> sentenced the brothers to life in prison after they were convicted of masterminding the killing of Judge <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinnici </PERSON>, who had been investigating their activities. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>'s killing `` a clear challenge to the state'' that recently named a special investigator, Judge <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Sica </PERSON>, to crack down on the Mafia and its financial links in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>, who had been transferred from the court in <LOCATION> Azzizes </LOCATION> to one in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> following the trial of the <ORGANIZATION> Grecos </ORGANIZATION> and their associates, became the eighth magistrate killed by the Mafia in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> since 1968. Police said the killers shadowed <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> and his son as they left the nearby resort of <PERSON> Canicatti </PERSON>, where they had spent the weekend with relatives. In a deserted part of the <LOCATION> Agrigento-Caltanisetta </LOCATION> road in central <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, the killers rammed and stopped the judge's car and fired at least 20 shots through the windows. Police said the judge was hit by three bullets in the head and two in the chest and died instantly. His son was also hit by several bullets. An anonymous caller tipped police about two hours after the killings, sources reported.

<TEXT>
 In a weekend when residents marched to reclaim streets from violent gangs, four people died and seven others were wounded including a pregnant woman shot as part of an apparent gang initiation rite, police said. Residents of south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Saturday marched to protest gang violence in their neighborhoods. `` The walk that we made was simply to say to those people who want to intimidate us that we wo n't be intimidated,'' said <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghess </PERSON> of the South Central Organizing Committee. `` They think they have possession of those streets. We want them to know we plan to take charge of those streets.'' But that day in the area, one man was killed and three others were wounded in separate drive-by shootings, authorities said. A teen-age gang member on Saturday night walked into the apartment complex of <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 19 and three months pregnant, and opened fire, police Sgt. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON> said Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, sitting on the front steps of the complex, was shot in the lower back and was in stable condition Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> County-USC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Freeze said. Three 16-year-olds were arrested and booked for investigation of attempted murder. The attack was believed to be part of a gang initiation, police said. The boy who fired the shots was believed to be trying to impress other gang members. A second pregnant woman and two men were wounded Saturday by pellets from shotgun blasts fired from a passing car, authorities said. The expectant mother, who was n't identified, and the two men were treated for minor pellet wounds resulting from the incident on a <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> street, Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. In other shootings, one man was killed in a possible gang-related confrontation, a teen-ager was killed in an argument among fellow gang members and a pedestrian was fatally shot in a suspected gang-related incident. The highest weekend death toll from gang violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> this year occurred during the weekend before Labor Day, when 11 died.

<HEAD>Candidate Sponsors Contest To Publicize Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A candidate for the state's highest criminal court is publicizing his campaign with a contest that asks entrants about the race and promises a free trip to Sea World to the winner. Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, who says his bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has received little attention, placed a full-page ad in the September issue of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Monthly magazine with pictures of himself, a penguin and a dolphin under the headline `` A Real Political Contest.'' The ad includes a contest entry form that invites Texans to answer four true-or-false questions about <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON>'s race against incumbent Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The winner, to be selected in a drawing Oct. 18, gets a four-day, three-night vacation in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, complete with passes to see Sea World of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, tickets to a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spurs </ORGANIZATION> basketball game and a tour of the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. And there are prizes for the runners-up: 10 pounds of Tex-Mex frozen shrimp, three pairs of jogging shoes and an assortment of candy. `` It's innovative,'' said <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON>, who is currently a <LOCATION> Republican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> judge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` This is embarrassing,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erben </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state, said his office has studied <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON>'s contest and concluded it does not violate state election law. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the idea shows poor judgment. `` It creates a circus atmosphere in a race that ought to be dealt with seriously,'' he said. <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON> said he decided to conduct the contest after finding that people not only did n't recognize his name, but had never heard of the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the court of last resort for criminal cases in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said he wants to `` dramatize the fact that there is a citizen wall of apathy around the race.'' He added that he's received only about two dozen entries. The contest entry blank also has a box that can be checked for donations, but the ad specifies that entrants need not contribute to enter the contest.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief agency protested today to the Israeli army about the sharp rise in the number of Palestinian casualties since July in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protester died after he was shot in the mouth and at least 34 others were wounded today as violence swept the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The clashes came as Palestinians staged a general strike in the territories to protest the jailing of thousands of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Militants hoisted white sheets sprayed with red swastikas and scrawled anti-Israeli grafitti on walls. The U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which aids Palestinian refugees, said the number of Palestinians shot by army gunfire in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> jumped from 19 in July to 130 so far this month. The count did not include today's casualty toll. Figures for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> still are being compiled. `` There is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition that can not be justified,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Our concern is very real. This is not just a knee-jerk reaction to a bad day.'' The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, linked the increase in casualties to the introduction in August of plastic bullets that penetrate the body like live ammunition, but generally are not fatal unless fired from less than 20 yards. The introduction of plastic bullets lowered the threshold for opening fire. While troops are allowed to use live ammunition only in life-threatening situations, they can now fire plastic bullets to disperse stone-throwers. In violent clashes in the Arab village of <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukaber </PERSON> straddling <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s city limits, riot police fatally shot 19-year-old <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON> in the mouth during a stone-throwing protest, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> photographer said about 20 stone-throwers faced off with riot police, with the two groups standing on opposing hills. Police fired tear gas and then live ammunition, the photographer said. <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON>'s death brought to 272 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died during the same period. Widespread clashes spread throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and 34 Palestinians were wounded, including 26 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and eight in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Among the wounded was an 11-year-old deaf boy from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who was in serious condition with a bullet wound in the chest, the officials said. The army confirmed three wounded and said it was checking the other casualty reports. On Sunday, Jewish settlers tried to mark a festival celebrating the Jews' biblical wanderings by settling a patch of land in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops thwarted the attempt. The settlers were marking the beginning of the weeklong celebration of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the Israelites' wanderings in the desert after their exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Jews traditionally build makeshift huts on Sukkot to symbolize life in the wilderness. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the settlers' group, said 12 families and 20 single people pitched tents northwest of the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` They went to the site in the morning and set up there with tents, equipment and everything needed,'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said. He said the families had been promised more than a year ago that a settlement would be approved. The families `` were evacuated peacefully,'' <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> had warned that attempts by settlers to set up new colonies during Sukkot would be resisted by the government. About 120 Jewish settlements have been established in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied the lands in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> says about 72,000 people live in the settlements, surrounded by 1.5 million Palestinians.

<TEXT>
 Federal authorities suspect a suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> electronics company of illegally exporting computer equipment that may have been resold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. No charges have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Libra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, but documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> indicate the company and owner <PERSON> Rajeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Westmont </ORGANIZATION> are under investigation by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators said warehouses in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where computer parts were shipped by <PERSON> Libra </PERSON> for assembly into personal computers, turned out to be vacant. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> declined to comment on the investigation. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> had an unpublished number at his <ORGANIZATION> Westmont </ORGANIZATION> home and could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulani </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Libra </LOCATION>, confirmed that a search of company offices had been conducted, but said: `` This is ridiculous. Somebody made up a story.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bars exports of sophisticated computer equipment to Soviet-bloc nations because they could be used for military purposes. For the past seven years, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has conducted an ongoing investigation, called `` Operation Exodus,'' to stem illegal shipments of electronic equipment to the Eastern bloc. Federal agents, armed with search warrants, raided <PERSON> Libra </PERSON>'s offices and <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>'s home in late July, a court affidavit said The investigation began after federal authorities were contacted by officials of <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an electronics company. According to records obtained by the government, <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> purchased $ 338,000 worth of computer products, including high-speed memory devices, from <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> suppliers in the Chicago-area. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s distribution marketing manager for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, reported to <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that he suspected Libra might be violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export regulations by sending parts to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and possibly to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the affidavit said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Libra </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> representative, <PERSON> Sud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakwani </PERSON>, told him in May that <PERSON> Libra </PERSON> was `` re-exporting the components'' to another manufacturing site in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to the affidavit. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kakwani </PERSON> told him that `` his <LOCATION> Libra </LOCATION> colleagues in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were building a strong relationship with the ` Russian market,''' the affidavit said. After becoming suspicious, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> official decided to visit three addresses listed by <PERSON> Libra </PERSON> as the sites of their assembly facilities in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, but found two partly empty warehouses and an apartment, according to court documents.

<HEAD>Reagan Ending Convoys But Keeping Navy Close By</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided today to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoys of American-flagged ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> but will keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships, the White House announced. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted `` after reviewing the current cease-fire ..., which has been in effect since Aug. 20, and consulting with allies and friends in the region.'' There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire began. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president made the decision in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before leaving for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he was to discuss the change with heads of state from the region. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after a farewell speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, had meetings set with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, the ruling emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The president's meeting with the sheik is the first since <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> came to power in 1976. The convoy operation, begun 14 months ago, involved a precise <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> formation used to protect against potential Iranian attacks Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. `` The modification entails a change from a ` tight escort' procedure to an ` accompany' regime,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said on Air Force One as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` In an ` accompany' regime, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will be positioned such that they can take appropriate action if American-flagged ships are directly threatened.'' There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire went into effect. The spokesman said that even with the change, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` intends to maintain in the gulf the forces required to protect U.S.-flagged shipping and support our national objectives. These changes in no way alter our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf.'' The spokesman said the move is `` the first step in the change of our presence. We will continue to review our presence in the gulf and will make changes as the threat diminishes.'' For now, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will not reduce its presence in the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 26 ships in its Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including 17 in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. As of Sept. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began. When asked whether the move could lead to normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We've always said we're willing to talk to authorized Iranian officials. But he said that there have been no requests from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a meeting and that there has been no news regarding the American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The spokesman said it will take a few days before the changes in gulf escorting take place and there are no plans to make a formal announcement at that time.

<HEAD>Young Praises Unheralded Role Of Southern Governors On Civil
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEA ISLAND, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Southern governors by and large got a bum rap during the civil rights struggle, and their behind-the-scenes efforts to resolve social problems were largely ignored, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said today. In a keynote speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference, the former aide to civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said news accounts of the period focused on the `` embarrassing'' public activities of some governors rather than on the work they were doing privately `` In the difficult, dark days of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, when it was extremely unpopular politically to be for justice, there were Southern governors who took the risk ... and found ways to deal with the problems without losing their political credibility,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He attributed much of the change in the South today to the quiet work of those governors. Young drew a standing ovation from the governors and an audience of several hundred registered for the conference. Summarizing progress in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said that `` 25 years later, we're working together in a way most of us as children would never have believed possible.'' He added, however, `` We have only just begun to achieve the potential of this region.'' The governors are among 11 chief executives from Southern states participating in the 54th annual meeting of the SGA. The meeting began today and runs through Tuesday.

 Round One of the presidential candidates' debates went to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a slender margin over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to a panel of veteran debate judges who kept score for The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Three judges gave the nod to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, while the other three sided with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but the Democrat emerged with the most points on their ballots, 144-141. Several hundred television viewers polled by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> immediately after Sunday night's debate also thought the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was the winner. Of the 639 registered voters surveyed by the network, 44 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the encounter, 36 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 20 percent called it a tie. When <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> contacted the same people prior to the debate, 48 percent identified themselves as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suporters, 46 percent as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers and 6 percent undecided. Afterwards, 52 percent said they favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 45 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 3 percent remained undecided _ a shift toward the Democrat of no statistical signicance, given the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error. A copyrighted Newsweek magazine poll showed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters were evenly split in their assessment of which candidate won the Sunday debate, with 42 percent favoring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 41 percent saying the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee was the victor. The <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll showed that undecided swing voters went both ways _ 43 percent said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after the debate and 43 percent said they were more likely to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> survey, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, involved telephone interviews with 337 registered voters immediately after the debate. The margin of error was 6 percentage points. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> panel, said, `` There was no knockout punch by either party.'' <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, who gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 25-24 edge on his scorecard, said, `` On the very narrow, argumentative, technical sense, on the flow sheet, I think that Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the winner. But my suspicion is that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will emerge as the political victor from the debate. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had more blanks to fill in from the standpoint of the voters. ... He emerged as a credible alternative to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Unger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, director of forensics at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that in 12 years of judging presidential debates, `` It's the first time I've ever heard the candidates laughed at by the audience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was laughed at twice by the audience at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, on Iran-Contra and the abortion question, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was laughed at on crime.'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, who scored it 25-22 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said, `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was much more organized. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a tendency to ramble and be a little out of it.'' But she praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for `` deflecting his potential bloopers with humor.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, national executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ripon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 23-21. He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` choppy and fumbling.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Southworth </PERSON>, director of forensics and professor of speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION>, rated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 27-26 winner. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position that you must negotiate -LRB- with the Soviets -RRB- out of strength was never answered,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sferra </PERSON>, director of forensics at <ORGANIZATION> J.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mullen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 23-21 edge, while L.D. <PERSON> Naegelin </PERSON>, speech and theater arts consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, scored it 25-23 for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The judges watched the debate on television in their own hometowns, using a scorecard modeled after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballot </ORGANIZATION> for collegiate and scholastic debates. They awarded one to five points in each of six categories: reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination and presentation.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resumed campaign hostilities from a distance today as the early soundings rated Sunday night's nationally televised debate as close as their race for the White House. `` I really think it went well. I really think it went great,'' the vice president told reporters as he departed the debate city for a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, with running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and said the 90-minute debate had provided `` the best moments of this whole campaign.'' In remarks prepared for a rally, the Democrat heralded the opportunity to move beyond `` the slogans and labels, the photo opportunities and the flag-waving, and get down to the real issues.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> left it to his campaign manager to claim victory. `` Our own polls showed us winning the debate decisively,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went into the debate holding a narrow lead over his rival in most surveys, with six weeks remaining until the election. The debate was marked by numerous biting comments as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clashed over the deficit, defense issues and dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in their 90 minutes on stage at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> said a poll taken immediately after the debate found that 42 percent of the voters who watched the debate said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a better job while 41 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outperformed his rival. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll taken Sunday night found that 44 percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 20 percent said it was a tie. Those polled had been contacted by the network prior to the debate and, at that time, 48 percent supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 46 percent backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 6 percent were undecided, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. In the survey taken just following the debate, 52 percent said they supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 45 percent supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 3 percent were undecided. Given the margin or error, that shift is statistically meaningless, said network polling analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would oppose criminal prosecution of women who receive abortions, even though the vice president said during the debate that he had n't `` sorted out of the penalties.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes abortion in most cases. Said Baker: `` He would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal, notwithstanding his views on the right-to-life. Women should be seen as an additional victim.'' The pollsters began weighing in as the two candidates returned to their task for the final six weeks of the campaign. The two men will debate again in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Oct. 13 or 14, and vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sqaure off in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> on Oct. 5. `` It was a good night,'' Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after the 90-minute encounter Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his Republican rival, gave the thumbs-up sign and told cheering supporters the debate had given him a chance `` to spell out some of the differences.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> agreed that neither candidate suffered any self-inflicted wounds in the debate, and both probably gained stature. `` I do n't think either side won, but I think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came very close to winning and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came close to losing,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the vice president won the debate on style and substance, and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed on both counts. `` We think this debate reaffirmed the contrasts between the positions of these two candidates that has projected <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into that lead,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In the first of two face-to-face meetings, there was very little warmth between the candidates other than the traditional handshakes at the beginning and end. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had hoped for a `` little friendlier an evening.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused him of questioning his patriotism; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> painted his opponent as a `` far-out liberal.'' In terms of issues, the debate broke no new ground but it gave the candidates _ locked in a close race _ a chance to press their cases against their opponents before their largest audience ever, in the tens of millions. Trying to capitalize on their debate performances, the two candidates headed separate ways today, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigning in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved North. Right from the start in their first debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took an aggressive stand, accusing the Reagan-Bush administration of doing business `` with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.'' In reply, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was no `` hard evidence'' that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was involved in drugs `` until we indicted him.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and for vetoing a bill that would have required public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' judgment was at issue, adding, `` I hope people do n't think that I'm questioning his patriotism.'' Given a chance to respond, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> coldly declared, `` Of course the vice president is questioning my patriotism. ... And I resent it. I resent it.'' Noting that he was the son of immigrants, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I'm in public service because I love this country. I believe in it. And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fired tart words at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after a question about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his qualifications to step into the presidency, if necessary. `` Judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently refers to his running mate by his full name of <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back, `` I doubt very much that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the best qualified person for that job. And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' is a very, very troubling notion tonight.'' The two candidates traded a series of one-liners, beginning when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` the <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics,'' _ referring to television commercials in which the salesman makes implausible claims for <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> cars. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted, `` That answer was about as clear as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' referring to the pollution in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> depicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal Democrat `` out of the mainstream,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee challenged the vice president's judgment, particularly on the Iran-Contra scandal. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the chairman of a task force on terrorism, `` endorsed the sale of arms to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country, and I dare say, encourages others to take hostages.'' In reply, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Yes, we should n't trade arms for hostages, but we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.'' Going on the attack, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, a claim that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> protested was not true. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> panel of six veteran debate judges gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a narrow edge over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Three judges thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won and three picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but the Democrat got the most points overall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got top marks for presentation and organization, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning.

 Two Indian activists went to court today for their trial on charges of taking hostages at a newspaper in what they say was an effort to spotlight local corruption, but one was without his regular lawyer. Defense lawyers have said they will argue that <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> acted out of necessity when up to 20 people were taken hostage at The Robesonian on Feb. 1. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> today denied a request for a continuance in the trial, even though <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, was not present because he is involved in another trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had said repeatedly he would not participate in the trial without <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>. `` I will not be there,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, famed for his defense of leftist causes, said last week. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> will not have a lawyer. He will, I think ... stand up and tell that jury at every opportunity that he is there without a lawyer.'' When he granted a third delay in the case Aug. 1, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> that he did not intend to continue the case again and said another lawyer should be prepared to begin the trial if <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> was not present. But lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> asked the judge today to delay the trial until Oct. 18, when <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> should be through with the other case. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> has said he does not want <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> as his attorney at the trial, though <ORGANIZATION> Nakell </ORGANIZATION> has represented him in some other hearings. The judge turned down <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON>'s request. The defendants are charged with hostage-taking and manufacturing illegal weapons. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, have never denied that they took over the offices of The Robesonian in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, but say they did so to draw attention to their allegations of discrimination against minorities and drug trafficking by local law enforcement agencies. They say they were driven to commit `` an act of desperation'' because their knowledge of the drug trafficking had put their lives in danger. `` We have a necessity defense in this case ... -LRB- which -RRB- involves showing that neither <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> or <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> had any legal alternatives to what they did and that they were in fear of their lives on Feb. 1,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' attorney, said last week. The 10-hour siege at the newspaper ended after Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to form a state task force to investigate their charges. But <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, who say they are <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, met only once with the task force, which issued a preliminary report saying it had found little evidence to back up their charges. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and their supporters said the task force did not do a thorough investigation and that potential witnesses would not testify without federal and state immunity. The defendants' lawyers have conducted their own investigation and say they have potential witnesses who could back up the charges of official wrongdoing. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> disappeared Aug. 31 after a federal appeals court revoked his bond. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> surrendered to marshals the same day. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> one week ago when he stepped off a plane with a <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> associate.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s winds, a threat only to ships in the central <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, dropped to 95 mph today as the storm continued to move north into colder, strength-sapping waters, forecasters said. `` It's going to gradually weaken from here on in,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center. `` We've estimated it to become a minimal hurricane within the next 72 hours and weaken even further after that.'' At one time last week, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> had winds of 140 mph as it kept a westward course across warm tropical waters, but it then veered northward. At noon EDT today, the storm's center was near latitude 25.3 north and longitude 49.7 west, or about 1,400 miles southwest of the westernmost <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> was headed north at 15 mph away from all land areas for the next few days, according to a center advisory. Hurricanes are composed of strong winds revolving around warm cores of low pressure fueled in part by the tropical waters that spawn them. Cold water weakens the storms. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s northerly course should eventually cause it to die out, unlike its predecessor <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which turned its deadly winds west and grew into a category 5 hurricane _ the strongest possible. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Both storms came out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as disturbed weather systems this month, the busiest time of the six-month <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Hurricane Season that begins June 1. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, and the fourth with winds exceeding 74 mph, earning it classification as a hurricane. Two other hurricanes, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, caused only minor damage in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today the first presidential debate provided the `` the best moments of the whole campaign,'' and his aides declared him the decisive winner over Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people finally had the chance to look beyond the slogans and labels, the photo opportunities and the flag-waving, and get down to the real issues,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for a rally here, his first stop after leaving the debate site, <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` We heard a lot of talk last night from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the mainstream. But it's clear that he's willing to leave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families high and dry,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` What happened last night was long overdue. Those 90 minutes were the best moments of this whole campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager, said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's polls `` showed us winning the debate decisively.'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, at a briefing in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> departed on a campaign swing to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> succeeded in `` dominating the debate virtually from beginning to end, speaking to the issues of concern to voters sitting around their kitchen tables.'' As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she said, the vice president `` failed to dominate the debate at all.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign chairman, said the Democratic nominee `` kept <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on defense all night long. He took the issues, he discussed the issues, he was putting in the innovative proposals that the working Americans are worried about, their concerns and anxieties. And I thought that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shaky all night long.'' With the first debate behind him, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading out to campaign in key industrial states that are likely to determine the outcome of the election. On his schedule today were stops in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> By the end of the week, the Democratic nominee also will campaign in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On Sunday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went from the debate on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to a rally a few miles away in the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> Convention Center where he told supporters, `` The message tonight that we were able to convey.. was that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic ticket are prepared to provide leadership on the real challenges that face this country and the real concerns of Americans all over this country. `` This is going to be a tough, competitive stretch drive,'' he said of the final six weeks of the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will debate again in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Oct. 13 or Oct. 14, the exact date hinging on the baseball playoff schedule. Their running mates _ Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ will debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, on Oct. 5. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor delivered his strongest response to date when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised what has become known as the Pledge of Allegiance issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scored heavily by attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing legislation that would have required recitation of the pledge in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> public schools. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised it again during the debate and said he was not questioning his opponent's patriotism. `` Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded. `` I do n't think there's any question about that. And I resent it, I resent it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered an impassioned defense of his choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for the Republican ticket. `` I'm putting my faith in a whole generation of young people who are in their thirties and in their forties,'' the vice president said. `` Judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and innuendo,'' he said, chiding <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for referring to the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as `` <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' `` Do you know who <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> was?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He was a man that gave his life in World War II. So ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't give an inch. He said that `` for most people the notion of ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' is a very, very troubling notion tonight.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was asked to respond to the perception that he is `` passionless, technocratic _ the smartest clerk in the world.'' `` I care deeply about people,'' he responded. `` All people, working people, working families, people all over this country who in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck.'' He recalled his 1978 defeat in the Democratic gubernatorial primary when he was running for a second term. `` Defeat is sometimes an important lesson,'' he said. `` I think I'm a much better governor today. I think I'm a much better person, a much better listener. I think I'll be a much better president for having gone through that experience.''

 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, whose escapades as President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s beer-guzzling good ol' boy brother alternately amused and dismayed Americans, `` struggled courageously'' with the cancer that killed him, his family says. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> died at home of pancreatic cancer, the same disease that killed his father and an older sister, on Sunday morning at the age of 51. A few blocks away in this southwestern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> hamlet, a flag flew at half-staff across the street from the gas station where <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> often downed beers while entertaining reporters with his irreverent wit. `` He had a heart of gold,'' said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, who operated the station for six months when <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> moved away. `` He made you feel good just being around him. You never saw a frown on his face.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> `` died quietly and peacefully in his sleep ... with his family at his bedside,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on behalf of the former president and his family. `` He had struggled courageously with his illness, never losing his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved him than about himself,'' the family said. Plains Mayor <PERSON> Lynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> today as `` a good person. He was a friend, and the people who were his personal friends will really miss him.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said he expected a large crowd for the funeral and called in officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Americus </LOCATION> to assist his three-member department in traffic control. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a self-proclaimed beer-drinking good ol' boy, was forced to redefine himself when big brother <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> rocketed into the White House in 1977. Within a few years, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> put his name on a brand of beer that flopped, got in hot water with remarks denounced as racist or anti-Semitic, accepted money from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and was forced to sell some properties to pay a debt to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But underneath the mask of court jester was a perceptive man, an avid reader, a fighter who refused to go down quietly under the pressures of alcoholism or cancer. He was born <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, on March 29, 1937, the youngest of four children. He grew up in Archery, a child with a stutter and a poor student. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> was 13 when the family moved the three miles to <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and 16 when his father died. He ran the family peanut business until <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer 13 years his senior, returned home to take over. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, chafing under his brother's reign, quickly married his high school sweetheart, <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON>, and joined the Marines. He later took over the peanut business, turning it into a $ 5 million operation, as his brother got involved in politics. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also made a stab at politics, running unsuccessfully for mayor of Plains in 1976. His quick, often profane wit made him a hit on the personal appearance circuit. He once said he did n't like sleeping in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because he got lost, `` I could n't find the bathroom and I'd had 20 beers before I went to bed.'' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> stood gamely by his brother, refusing to muzzle him, joking about <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s contributions to the beer industry and assuring reporters his brother was a competent, capable man. But the brothers were forced to put some distance between themselves in 1979, after <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and served as host for a return visit by Libyan officials. He also disclosed he had accepted $ 220,000 from the Libyans. In 1979, a federal grand jury investigated whether loans to the family peanut warehouse were diverted to the presidential campaign, allegations <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> denied. He spent seven weeks in an alcohol rehabilitation program that year. In 1981, to help pay a $ 105,000 debt to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, he sold his Plains home and the gas station. He moved to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, worked as a mobile home salesman, and returned to <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> in 1986. In September 1987, doctors told him he had inoperable cancer of the pancreas. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> refused to knuckle under, saying he'd get a voodoo doctor if necessary. He tried a variety of experimental treatments and lived longer than his doctors expected. A graveside funeral service was set for this afternoon at <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and his father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, are buried. In addition to his wife and brother, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is survived by six children, ages 11 to 31, and sister <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Deformed and disfigured people came from around <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> hospital, lured by promises of better function and self-esteem, and returned across the border with new faces, ears or improved hands. And it did n't cost them a cent, thanks to churches, a hospital, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> charity and dozens of medical workers who donated a 20-hour day to conduct back-to-back operations. Only those who have seen the medical needs of the poor south of the border could understand, said nurse <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who participated in the reconstructive surgical marathon Saturday at Mercy Hospital. `` I have never seen so many children with so many deformities that have n't been taken care of,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who's been in the field for 30 years. Her patients included a 6-year-old girl with a club hand, a 17-year-old girl with a peg of tissue instead of an ear and a 10-month-old baby with a cleft lip dividing her face up to her eyes. Other patients had club feet and one needed a hip replacement. She recalled an operation in which doctors repaired a 40-year-old woman's cleft lip under local anesthesic. `` After we finished with her surgery, we helped her hold a mirror up. She started crying,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 50. `` The change was so noticeable. She felt so good about how she looked. `` The doctor gave her his card and she clutched it to her heart. We all started crying, she was so overcome by gratitude.'' For the girl without an ear, doctors took a piece of rib and shaped it to form the external part of the hearing organ. `` That one took about 2 -LCB- hours,'' Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. About 20 surgeons, 12 anesthesiologists and more than 100 nurses, support staff and volunteers participated in the lengthy session, said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Avallone </PERSON>, the hospital's spokeswoman. About 30 patients came from as far south as the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for Saturday's operations, Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Local churches provided housing the night before the surgeries, which would have cost upwards of $ 500,000, officials said. Drug companies donated all required pharmaceutical materials. The hospital donated rooms and equipment. All but four were returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Sunday with whatever medical instructions and drugs they needed, Ms. <PERSON> Avallone </PERSON> said. Some were taken to a <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> hospital for observation but most went home. Those who remained hospitalized at Mercy were in good condition, she said. It was the second such surgical marathon for Mexican patients at <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, organized with <PERSON> Coad </PERSON>, a San Diego-based international charitable organization. In February, about 35 patients underwent reconstructive operations. <PERSON> Coad </PERSON>, `` helper'' in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>, was founded 15 years ago by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> construction mogul who discovered the need for such medical help during a fishing trip in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. He says he has since taken surgical teams to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to operate on thousands of people. For surgery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> travels around <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to locate patients with scars or birth defects, takes care of paperwork including visas, and provides bus transportation. `` You could say I have a Christian commitment, but that is not the real reason _ I do it because I like to do it,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> last week. Though weary from Saturday's long hours, Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she looked forward to the next <PERSON> Coad </PERSON> event for Mexican patients, tentatively scheduled for February 1989. `` I feel I have something to give and they need it so badly,'' she said. `` It changes their lives. They can be more like a normal person and feel better about themselves.''

<TEXT>
 The debate between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was broadcast live in some West European countries for those sufficiently addicted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics to stay up long after midnight. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> televised the entire debate live as did Austrian Television and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s state-run RAI network. The Austrians aired it in English, while RAI provided simultaneous translation into Italian. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> broadcast it live on radio and television. The debate was held too late for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s morning newspapers to comment, but two afternoon dailies were lukewarm. `` Overall, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came out better than many people had expected; but the debate will not have altered the growing impression, abroad as well as among many Americans, that for the most powerful job in the world the choice is between two mediocrities,'' said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s conservative Evening Standard. `` This may be a harsh judgment, but if there are impressive personalities behind the public faces of the two candidates, then it is high time they escaped from the suffocating embrace of their marketing men and revealed the humanity behind the hype,'' it said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the left-leaning <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> said there was `` no evident winner, no revelation on the character of the candidates, and absolutely nothing new as to their intentions.'' In his broadcast, Italian TV correspondent <PERSON> Antonello </PERSON> <PERSON> Marescalchi </PERSON> said: `` The result of the Bush-Dukakis match is still uncertain. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was probably better than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but there was no knockout.''

<HEAD>Party Meeting Expected To Slow Down Open-Market Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders convened a meeting Monday that was expected to call for a slowdown in market-oriented reforms that are fueling inflation and economic turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 162 members of the 175-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and several hundred other leading party members gathered at the Great Hall of the People for the five-day meeting. The agency said General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> delivered a speech outlining <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s troubled economic reforms over the next two years. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, it said, dealt with `` improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic order,'' catchwords for a more cautious stance emphasizing stability rather than new initiatives in the country's drive to reduce central planning and tie production to free-market forces. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> discussed ways to promote reform in a `` planned way and under unified leadership'' _ an apparent reference to reported differences within the party on how to cope with current economic problems. The 20 percent inflation _ spurred by rising consumer demand, profiteering and government moves to end some price subsidies _ has become a major source of complaint among urban residents. Corruption is rampant, industrial output is increasing at double the rate the economy can sustain, and local governments have ignored orders from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to cut back on unauthorized spending. Fears of further price increases have led to panic buying and runs on banks in August, with retail sales almost 40 percent higher than in the same month in 1987. Chinese leaders insist they will not turn their backs on reforms that have significantly improved the lives of millions of Chinese over the past decade. But they have admitted the reforms have hit a shoal of doubt and confusion. The government has tried to calm consumers and cool off the economy by promising there will be no more price increases this year, and by tightening money supplies and linking interest rates to the inflation rate. Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, who oversees economic policy, told visiting Soviet officials on Friday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not lift controls on the prices of grain and other staples. But the policy of freezing low prices has discouraged farmers from growing grain crops. At the party meeting, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> also discussed `` strengthening party leadership in order to bring the party's political advantage into full play,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said. The 47 million-member party is trying to improve an image tarnished by corruption within its ranks and to restore its prestige among a population disenchanted with ideology and political infighting. The Central Committee session may give some indication if <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, the most ambitious of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top reformers, has been politically damaged as a result of the nation's economic problems. There has been widespread speculation that Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, the more cautious head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government, has eclipsed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as the nation's top economic planner amid government concerns that a fast pace of reform could cause economic and social chaos. Western diplomats, however, say there is no indication that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, although he may have lost some prestige, is in serious political trouble.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese officials began searching northern Vietnamese villages Monday for people who may have seen plane crashes in which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers were lost more than 15 years ago, an official said. Two joint teams including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts drove to the areas near the capital of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to try to resolve the fates of seven airmen downed during the Vietnam War, said Maj. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. He said the teams headed out in jeeps the Americans flew in from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> the previous day, along with metal detectors and other equipment including forensic instruments in case human remains were found during the 10-day search. `` This is the first joint activity that involves tracking down of missing in action -LRB- MIA -RRB- cases,'' he said. `` The teams are investigating loss incidents that occurred and trying to interview individuals who may possess information surrounding the incidents.'' He said the two sides may later excavate any warplane crash sites that are found during the investigation. Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in late 1985, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up the wreckage of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> B-52 bomber just outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> but found no remains. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the teams will try to gather evidence such as the soldiers' personnel effects and local government reports of the incidents. He said the teams will search an area in <LOCATION> Bac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON> provinces, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bac </LOCATION> provinces 30 miles to the northeast of the capital. They may later investigate a third area southeast of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side brought in eight motorcycles for the Vietnamese to scout villages before the joint teams arrive. The seven cases are among 70 `` discrepancy cases'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to resolve urgently, claiming there is evidence the men survived and came under Vietnamese control. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says it has no evidence they remain alive 15 years after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We hope to accomplish many more joint investigation operations in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during this initial 90-day period of joint activity and continue beyond that time until this issue is resolved as fully as possible,'' said a statement from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team leader, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. `` We are prepared to provide four teams, if <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agrees.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> earlier called the project a significant breakthrough, and said joint investigations could resolve all 70 cases. A total of 2,393 Americans listed as MIA in the war -- 1,757 in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The war, which cost 58,000 American lives, ended when communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> defeated U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in April 1975.

<HEAD>GAO Says Unemployment Insurance System Endangered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The unemployment insurance system has enough reserves to last only five months in a severe recession and would have to borrow billions of dollars from the federal government to keep paying benefits, congressional watchdogs said Monday. Because states had to borrow $ 11.8 billion to keep paying benefits during the 1981-82 recession, most have tightened eligibility requirements so much that only one of every four jobless workers in October of last year received unemployment checks, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. `` The average proportion of unemployed receiving benefits during the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent received benefits.'' Although demographic changes in the workforce explain part of the decline, the report said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's emphasis on states repaying the $ 11.8 billion they borrowed in 1981-82 has caused at least 44 of them to tighten eligibility requirements. As of 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, state unemployment insurance trusts still owed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> a total of $ 4.8 billion. The combined state-federal system still had reserves of about $ 19.4 billion last year, enough to last about five months in a severe recessions, the watchdogs said. But, they added, recent recessions have tended to last at least 12 months, and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommends that each state carry sufficient reserves to pay benefits for 18 months. While 39 states had adequate reserves in 1969, no more than two states have had sufficient funds in any year since 1976 to deal with a recession without borrowing from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. The state-federal system was created as part of the New Deal to help cushion the blow of the Depression on laid off workers. The program is designed to be self-sufficient, with the federal government assumes the cost of administration while states pay the actual benefits with funds raised through a payroll tax on employers. Because states have been trimming benefits and tightening eligibility, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> questioned the system's ability to `` stabilize the economy and mitigate the effects of income loss suffered by the unemployed'' in the next recession. The report suggested that unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> somehow eases the burden, the country may see `` greater tax increases and larger benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the least favorable economic conditions.''

 Here is the text of remarks by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the 43rd General Asssembly Monday. Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates. Half a world away _ far from this place of peace _ the firing, the killing, the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the first time in recent memory diminished. After adding terrible new names to the roll call of human horror _ names such as <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, Maidan Shahr, and <LOCATION> Spin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buldak </LOCATION> _ there is today hope of peace in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. So, too, in the highlands and coastal cities of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ places of civil war, places of occupation by foreign troops _ talk of peace is heard, peace for the tortured nation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Six thousand five hundred miles further east, in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, there is hope now of a settlement, hope now of the removal of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupying forces. And finally in this hemisphere, where only 12 years ago one-third of the people of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> lived under <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule, some 90 percent do so today; and especially in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, nations such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, once thratened by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of totalitarian rule, now know the hope of self-government and the prospect of eocnomic growth. And, another change, Mr. Secretary-General. A change that if it endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our history _ a change that is cause for shaking of the head in wonder _ is also upon us. A change going to the source of post-war tensions, and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time _ totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war. For the first, time, the differences between East and West _ fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control people or people control governments _ for the first time, these differences ahve shown signs of easing. Easing to the point where there are not just troop withdrawals from places like <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but also talk in the East of reform and greater freedom of press, of assembly, and of religion. Yes, fundamental differences remain. But should talk of reform become more than that, should it become reality _ there is the prospect of not only a new era in Soviet-American relations but a new age of world peace. For such reform can bring peace; history teaches and my country has always believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are enshrined, war is a distant prospect; for it is not people who make war, governments do that. I stand at this podium then in a moment of hope. Hope, not just for the peoples of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but for all the peoples of the world. And hope, too, for the dream of peace among nations, the dream that began the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Precisely because of these changes, today, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before. Already, you, Mr. Secretary-General, through your persistence, patience, and unyielding will, have shown, in working toward peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, how valuable the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can be. We salute you for those accomplishments. And in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> at this very hour, there are numerous negotiations underway: multilateral negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues between the Soviets and ourselves. And these negotiations, some of them under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices, involve a broad arms control agenda; strategic offensive weapons; strategic defense and space; nuclear testing; and chemical warfare _ whose urgency we have witnessed anew in recent days. And, Mr. Secretary-General, the negotiators are busy _ and over the past few years they have been engaged in more than an academic exercise. There is movement. The logjam is broken. Only recently, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the INF agreement, an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles was eliminated for the first time in history. Progress continues on negotiations to reduce, in massive number, strategic weapons with effective verification. And talks will begin soon on conventional reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Much of the reason for all of this goes back, I believe, to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> itself; to the small chateau along the lake where I and the General Secretary of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had the first of several fireside chats _ exchanges characterized by frankness, but friendliness, too. I said at the first meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that this was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to start World War III or to begin a new age of peace among nations. And I also said peace conferences, arms negotiations, proposals for treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context _ a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper, underlying differences between us. I said to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then, as I have said to you before: Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed, they are armed because they mistrust each other. In that place, by that peaceful lake in neutral <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Grobachev </PERSON> and I did begin a new relationship based not just on engagement over the single issue of arms control, but on a broader agenda about our deeper differences; an agenda of human rights, regional conflicts, and bilateral exchanges between our peoples. Even on the arms control issue itself, we agree to go beyond the past. To seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to higher levels, but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced, and even eliminated, a whole class of nuclear weapons. What was begun that morning in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> has shown results. In the INF treaty. In my recent visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In my opportunity to meet there with Soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human rights. And to speak, too, in the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the young people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about the wonder and splendor of human freedom. The results of that morning in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are seen in peace conferences now under way around the world on regional conflicts; and in the work of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. But Mr. Secretary-General, history teaches caution; indeed, that very building in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where important negotiations have taken place _ the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accords </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> negotiations, for example _ we see it today as stone-like testimony to a failed dream of peace in another time. The Palais des Nations was the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ an institution that was to symbolize an end to all war. And yet that institution and its noble purpose ended with the Second World War, ended because the chance for peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of the world, ended because humanity did not find the courage to isolate the aggressors, to reject schemes of government that serve the state, not the people.

 Police on Tuesday will question two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic swimmers who are accused of stealing a marble lion's head from a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> hotel Angry South Koreans are demanding the pair be sent to prison. Police officials were quoted by <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers as saying the men _ <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Gjertsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalbey </PERSON> _ will not receive any special consideration when they are questioned about the theft Saturday of the $ 830 ornament. The decision on whether to prosecute the Americans will be made by the prosecutor's office after police submit a report. <PERSON> Gjertsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dalbey </PERSON>, who each won two gold medals, could be sentenced to 1-10 years in prison if convicted on charges of aggravated theft. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic officials said the incident was a foolish prank and kicked the pair off the American team. Police and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers said Monday they have been flooded with calls from irate people demanding the two Americans receive prison sentences. Newpapapers, which referred to the incident under the headline `` Ugly Americans,'' said many readers were calling to complain, and the publications backed the calls for tough treatment. The newspapers continued to bristle with denunciations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> press coverage of the Olympics and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Commentators charged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media was trying to blacken the nation's image. The influential <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial, `` The theft case involving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swimmers clearly shows the overbearing attitude of Americans.'' Newspapers compared the swimmers to a brawl on Thursday when South Korean boxing officials attacked a referee after a Bulgarian boxer was named the winner over local favorite <PERSON> Byun </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-il </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byun </PERSON> and some officials were suspended for the incident. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media should know that such incidents have greatly hurt the pride of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people who have worked hard to prepare for the Olympic Games for the past seven years, and as a result it is proliferating anti-American sentiments,'' said newspaper commentator <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong-woo </PERSON>. The Korean media and some government politicians have played up the arrest of the swimmers in an apparent attempt to divert attention from the boxing incident. The media and many people have denounced <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for its coverage of the incident, claiming the American network played it up to embarrass <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Newspapers have complained that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media failed to focus on the incident involving the swimmers in the same way that it dwelt on the boxing incident. `` How is <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the momentary violent act in the boxing in such a manner, going to explain the theft case involving athletes from its own country?'' <PERSON> Joong-Ang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilbo </PERSON> said. The boxing incident was extensively covered by television around the world. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is the only foreign network seen in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where it is shown on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military network. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main ally, but there has been some tension between the two nations over trade and political issues. Some South Koreans claim Americans want to dominate them, but many observers say Korean resentment reflects growing pains as it emerges from years of dependence on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Sales of existing single-family homes increased a modest 1.1 percent in August to the second-highest level of the year as buyers tried to close purchases before interest rates rose further, a real estate trade group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.67 million units last month, following a sharp 5.0 percent decline in July. Except for the 3.82 million rate in June, the August pace was the fastest in 15 months. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said buyers completing sales in August probably began looking for homes in May and June. `` That was just after rates started rising,'' he said. The increase `` was a mild panic response to rising rates.'' Fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 10 percent in February and March and have since risen to about 10.5 percent as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> fought inflation through higher interest rates. Many economists expect rates to top 11 percent by early next year. `` Basically, what we're seeing here is the movement of households into the market now to avoid what they perceive to be deteriorating conditions. This has persisted through the summer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the real estate association. He predicted sales will decline the rest of the year, bringing them for all of 1988 to 3.45 million units, a 2.1 percent decline from 1987. <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON> said stronger-than-expected resales so far this year are a reflection of a robust economy in general. `` We've gone a nice long time with a good strong housing market. ... We've had a few declines, but we're still looking at a pretty strong market,'' he said. After hitting a low of 1.99 million units in the recession year of 1982, resales climbed to a record high of 3.56 million units in 1986. <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON> said sales likely would decline next year as interest rates rise in the first half, but then recover in 1990. All of the strength in August came in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where sales rose 4.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.42 million units, rebounding from a 4.2 percent decline in July. In the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>, sales fell 2.9 percent to a 670,000-unit rate, following a 6.8 percent decline in July. Sales were unchanged in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and West, at 910,000 units and 650,000 units, respectively. Analysts have attributed the softening of sales in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to high prices and to the effects of the October stock market crash on employment in financial service industries. Sales in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, they say, are beginning to pick up, a reflection of the strong manufacturing economy. The median price of a home rose from July to August by $ 600 to $ 91,300, up 5.5 percent from a year ago when the median sales price for an existing home was $ 86,500. The Northeast remained the costliest region of the country, with a median sales price of $ 144,800 last month, up 6.7 percent from a year ago. It was followed by a median price of $ 122,000 in the West, up 6.0 percent from a year ago; $ 84,300 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, up 4.3 percent; and $ 70,500 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, up 6.0 percent.

 Top officials appealed Monday to parents and teachers to stop dissident students from going underground and linking up with ethnic insurgents to fight the military-led government. Also Monday, the governing party chose a new name in what one diplomat described as an attempt to change its tarnished image. In recent months, millions of people have engaged in street demonstrations, strikes and other acts of opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the 26 years of political repression and economic decline associated with it. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> announced the party was changing its name to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but did not say why. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the move as an attempt `` to change their image -LRB- and -RRB- make a break with the past.'' Students were among the leaders of the anti-government demonstrations. Many have gone underground since Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power from a civilian president in a military coup Sept. 18, and security forces, by government count, have killed more than 250 civilians in the crackdown that followed. The government described many of those killed as looters. Diplomats believe far more than 250 people died during the crackdown, including unarmed demonstrators who marched the day after the coup. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> remained quiet Monday, although troops stopped all cars for security checks in the capital's downtown. `` Some students, being misled by unscrupulous people, have gone underground and several others are preparing to follow suit,'' acting Education Minister <PERSON> Pe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON> said in an appeal broadcast Monday night on state-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` Parents are asked to prevent their children from being misled by unscrupulous people,'' he said. The army commander, Lt. Gen. Than Shwe, issued a similar radio address, urging parents and teachers to stop students from going into hiding or linking up with rebel groups seeking autonomy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` The army has no intention to take any action against students, except those who had committed specific criminal offenses,'' he said. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s strongest ethnic rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday that 90 student protesters fled to his group's border base camps where they may get military training. Border security officials in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> have reported students crossing the frontier in recent days. The main ongoing anti-government activity is a general strike that began Aug. 8 and has paralyzed <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Authorities have ordered civil servants to return to work by Monday. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has pledged to hold multiparty elections once peace is restored to the impoverished nation, but he has set no timetable. The last such elections were held in 1960. Three key opposition leaders _ <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, Tin Oo and <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> _ formed an umbrella group Saturday to unite the millions of students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, government workers and others struggling for democracy. The group have called for a non-partisan interim government to conduct the elections.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: the people.</HEAD>

 We are here today, Mr. Secretary-General, determined that no such fate shall befall the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We are determined that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind. So, Mr. Secretary-General, we realize that, even in this time of hope, the chance of failure is real. But this knowledge does not discourage us. It spurs us on. For the stakes are high: Do we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generations? Or do we continue the work of the founders of this institution and see to it that, at last, freedom is enshrined and humanity knows war no longer. And that this place, this floor shall be truly `` the world's last battlefield.'' We are determined it shall be so. So we turn now to the agenda of peace. Let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my mind when I met with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> as well as on the minds of Soviet citizens I met in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It is also an issue that I know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this assembly who, this fall, commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the greatest peril, that peace rests on one foundation: observing `` the inalienable rights of all members of the human family.'' In a century where human rights have been denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in history _ with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated as a matter of state policy _ a history, it has been said, of blood, stupidity, and barbed wire _ few can wonder why peace has proved so elusive. Let us understand. If we would have peace, we must acknowledge the elementary rights of our fellow human beings. In our own land. And in other lands. If we would have peace, the trampling of the human spirit must cease. Human rights is not for some, some of the time. Human rights, as the universal declaration of this assembly adopted in 1948 proclaims, is: `` for all people and all nations.'' And for all time. This regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Those who starve in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, those who die among the Kurds, those who face racial injustice in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, those who still can not write or speak freely in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, those who can not worship in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, those who can not publish or assemble in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> _ all of this is more than just an agenda item on your calendar. It must be a first concern; an issue above others. For when human rights concerns are not paramount at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> _ when the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms _ then the very credibility of this organization is at stake, the very purpose of its existence in question. That is why when human rights progress is made, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> grows stronger and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is glad of it. Following a two-year effort led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> took a major step toward ending the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much of its past. For years, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights, has escaped <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> censure or even scrutiny This year, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has responded to pressure generated by the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> by accepting an investigation into its human rights abuses. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has already begun to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group. More must be done; the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must be relentless and unyielding in seeking change. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and elsewhere. And we must also see to it that the universal declaration itself should not be debased with episodes like the `` Zionism is Racism'' Resolution. Respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of this body, the most elementary obligation of its members. Indeed, wherever one turns in the world today there is new awareness, a growing passion for human rights _ the people of the world grow united; new groups, new coalitions form; coalitions that monitor government, that work against discrimination, that fight religious or political repression, unlawful imprisonment, torture or execution. As those I spoke to at Spaso House said to me last June: such movements make a difference. Turning now to regional conflicts, we feel again the uplift of hope. In the gulf war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War II _ we have a cease-fire. The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace. So, too, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s decisive resolution in July a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful gulf. Let this war _ a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished, only victims _ let this war end now. Let both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> cooperate with the Secretary-General and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in implementing Resolution 598. Let peace come. Moving on to a second region _ when I first addressed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, world attention was focused on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. After nearly nine long years of war, the courage and determination of the Afghan people and the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> freedom fighters have held sway _ today, an end to the occupation is in sight. On April 14, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> signed the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accords </ORGANIZATION>, which were negotiated under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. We encourage the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference. In southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, too, years of patient diplomacy and support for those in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> who seek self-determination are having their effect. We look forward to an accord between the governments of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops _ primarily <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> _ from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. We look forward as well to full implementation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. We continue to support a growing consensus among African leaders who also believe there can be no reconciliation within <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Mr. Secretary-General, there are new hopes for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we sought the freedom and independence of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. We urge the rapid removal of all Vietnamese troops and a settlement that will prevent the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to power, permitting instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government _ a government that will, at last, respect fully the rights of the people of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly borne. In other critical areas, we applaud the Secretary-General's efforts to structure a referendum on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> And in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island nation. Finally, we look to a peaceful solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. So, too, the unnatural division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> remains a critical obstacle to Soviet-American relations.

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s traditionalist movement ordained seven new priests, the first since it formally split with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in June, a member of the movement said Monday The ordination Sunday was performed by one of the new bishops, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in attendance, said a member of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION> identifying himself as <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. Six of the new priests are French and one is Italian, he said. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, whose movement campaigns against reforms which he says are spreading the `` cancer of liberalism'' in the church, on June 30 consecrated four bishops without papal approval. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> condemned the consecrations as as act of schism, a formal break with the Holy See. It announced that <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the four bishops were automatically excommunicated, or ejected from the church, for refusing to submit to papal authority. It was the first schism since 1870, when Old Catholics split with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> over the dogma of papal infallibility. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, 82, said he consecrated the bishops to ordain priests in his movement after he died. He set up his first seminary in 1970 in the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>, rejecting several changes of the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1962-65. <PERSON> Lebebvre </PERSON> named it after <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, who condemned the modernist `` Le Sillon'' movement in 1910. In 1976, Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> suspended him from his priestly functions after <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> continued to celebrate Mass in Latin, rather than in the vernacular. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> ignored the sanction. He has since ordained more than 220 traditionalist priests, and seminaries of his movement operate worldwide.

 Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has launched an offensive depicting Republican Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s administration as riddled with ethical shortcomings as polls show <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> pulling ahead in his re-election bid. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, in turn, has questioned <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s respect for the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and criticized the Democratic challenger for telling blacks he could not support their views publicly for fear of alienating `` the white redneck vote.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a former congressman who rode President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails to victory in 1984, is the second <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor elected this century in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and would be the first re-elected in state history <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a 55-year-old lumber mill executive. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the governor and lieutenant governor run separately. There have been disagreements between <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> throughout their term on issues from highway funding to veto power for the governor. But their longest battle was over the budget, which in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> must be balanced. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of being irresponsible in turning in an unbalanced budget. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> responded that he had no way of knowing when he submitted his budget that changes in tax collections would make it unbalanced. Both are moderates with strong business ties who emphasize education, highway expansion, economic growth and environmental protection. They expect to spend $ 5 million each, a state record for a two-candidate gubernatorial race. Some insiders said the average voter probably can not see much difference between the two. A Charlotte Observer poll Sept. 11-14 gave <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> 51 percent support to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 43 percent among 802 voters surveyed. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The paper's poll in May saw the race as a dead heat. A survey for The News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> an even bigger lead. Of 806 likely voters interviewed Sept. 11-13, 47 percent favored <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 36.4 percent <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and 16.6 percent were undecided. The margin of error was 3.5 points. In mid-September, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> went on the attack, accusing <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of `` cynical manipulation of government for political purposes.'' During his tenure <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> weakened the state financial disclosure rule and stacked environmental protection commissions with developers who had conflicts of interest, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> charged. He accused <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of giving jobs to spouses of top aides, buying a leading Democrat's support with a $ 329-a-day role as an adviser and making one department `` a tax-paid campaign headquarters'' and another `` a graveyard for defeated Republican candidates.'' `` Part of leadership is who you surround youself with, whether or not you protect the public trust,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> is a nice fellow. But that does n't mean he is a good governor.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> called the attacks `` a smear.'' `` He -LRB- <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> -RRB- is a decent enough guy that he will be ashamed of himself for trying to impugn my ethics,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was being more aggressive because his positive approach had been ineffective. `` He's got to poke some holes in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s armor,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` He's got to develop reasons for the voters why <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> ought to be removed from office.'' Earlier this month, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> cried foul over a radio commercial <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> aired on black-oriented stations. The spot consisted of a conversation in a fictitious barbershop. It said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> declined <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s offer to be chairman of a commission planning activities for the state <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> holiday. `` I wonder what <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has against <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>,'' it said. The ad did not mention that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> supported a 1987 bill establishing the holiday while <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> opposed it. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> aides called the commercial sleazy and a black commission member resigned in protest. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> told a group of black newspaper executives he agreed with them on some issues that he could not discuss publicly for fear of alienating `` the white redneck vote.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has needled his opponent by telling audiences he wants their votes `` regardless of your race, creed or the color of your neck.'' `` We're not writing off the black vote and we're not going to let them -LRB- Democrats -RRB- take it for granted,'' the governor said. About 20 percent of the state's 3.2 million registered voters are black.

<HEAD>Swope Completes Cross-State Trip In Less Than 24 Hours</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former cancer patient says he surprised even himself when he took less than a day to ride his bicycle across most of the length of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to raise money for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> arrived in this northeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city about 4:30 a.m. EDT Monday, approximately 400 miles from <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, where he began his trek at 7 a.m. EDT Sunday. `` I thought I would take every minute of 24 hours. I think everybody did,'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> said. `` There was a lot of energy and poignance attached to this effort,'' he said. `` I could n't have done it just to do it. I needed a mission like the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> believed he reached his goal of raising $ 20,000 in individual and corporate pledges for cancer research. `` The money has n't been tallied,'' said crew chief <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Omer </PERSON>, `` but we're expecting to meet our goal.'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, experienced no health problems during his ride but planned to rest for two to three days, <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> was diagnosed as having malignant melanoma _ a form of skin cancer _ three years ago. Doctors removed a growth from his back and told him they felt certain they got it all, he said in a pre-ride interview. The 5-foot-8, 136-pound athlete said he undertook the trip because he `` wanted others to know that people can recover and be cured from cancer.'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> said hills and fog that covered much of the state Monday morning made the last 50 miles of the trip the toughest. `` The terrain was a nightmare,'' he said. <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> added that a 12 mph headwind in the western section of the state caught him by surprise but, in the end, did not affect the outcome. `` Cyclists are almost like sailors, we always watch the wind ... especially if you weigh 136 pounds and are riding a 19-pound bike,'' he said. `` But it was n't the negative factor I thought it would be. It just became a matter of time and distance.'' <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> is glad it's over. `` It's been a long three months -LRB- of intense training -RRB-,'' she said. `` Now we can go on to other things.'' `` It's going to be kind of strange to go home,'' she added. `` We'll probably sit there and say ` Now what to we do?'''

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: Soviet-American relations.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In most of these areas, then, we see progress and, again, we are glad of it. Only a few years ago, Mr. Secretary-General, all of these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control. Indeed, the invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the apparent failure of will among democratic and peace-loving nations to deter such events seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and small was epidemic, a climate the world had not seen since the 1930s. Only this time, larger war was avoided, avoided because the free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of purpose and will. And now the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is providing valuable assistance in helping this epidemic to recede. And because we are resolved to keep it so, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflicts. I refer to the continuing deterioration of human rights in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community. This elite _ in calling itself revolutionary _ seeks no real revolution; the use of the term is subterfuge, deception for hiding the oldest, most corrupt vice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the lives and steal the freedom of others. That is why, as president, I will continue to urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to stand with those who are threatened by this regime's aggression against its neighbors in Central America. Today, I also call on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to show in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in other regional conflicts. To assist in bringing conflict in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime, a regime whose goals of regional domination _ while ultimately doomed _ can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to Soviet-American relations. Unless action is taken now. Moving now to the arms reduction agenda, I have mentioned already the importance of the INF treaty and the momentum developed in the START negotiations. The draft START treaty is a lengthy document, filled with bracketed language designating sections of disagreement between the two sides. But through this summer in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, those brackets have diminished; there is every reason to believe this process can continue. I can tell this Assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months, but I can tell you a year from now is a possibility, more than a possibility. But we have no deadline. No agreement is better than a bad agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains hopeful and we acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in these negotiations. We also look for that spirit to be applied to our concerns about compliance with existing agreements. So, too, our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and space have been useful. But let me here stress to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control negotiations is due to technological progress itself, especially in the potential for space-based defensive systems. I believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> determination to research and develop and, when ready, deploy such defensive systems _ systems targeted to destroy missiles, not people _ accounts for a large share of the progress made in recent years in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. With such systems, for the first time, in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere, major powers will not be faced with the single option of massive retaliation, but will instead have the chance of a saner choice _ to shield against an attack instad of avenging it. So, too, as defensive systems grow in effectiveness, they reduce the threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals. Only recently, briefings I have received in the Oval Office indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought. Today, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reaffirms its commitment to its Strategic Defense Initiative and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with others. And yet, even as diplomatic and technological progess holds out the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have lived under in the post-war era, even at this moment another ominous terror is loose once again in the world. A terror we thought the world had put behind, a terror that looms at us now from the long, buried past; from ghostly, scarring trenches and the haunting, wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane conflicts of all time. Poison gas. Chemical warfare. Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, the terror of it. The horror of it. We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war _ beyond its tragic human toll _ jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I. Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> signatories to that protocol, as well as other concerned states, to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty. And we urge all nations to cooperate in negotiating a verifiable, truly global ban on chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. It is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban, once and for all _ and on a verifiable and global basis _ the use of chemical and gas warfare. Finally, Mr. Secretary-General, we must redouble our efforts to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. Likewise, proliferation in other high-technology weapons such as ballistic missiles is reaching global proportions, exacerbating regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications. The number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate and more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons. This was a matter of discussion last week between Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Talks between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet experts begin on this today. And we hope to see a multilateral effort, to avoid having areas of tension like the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> become even more deadly battlegrounds than they already are. But in most of these areas, we see not only progress but also the potential for an incrasingly vital role for multilateral efforts and institutions like the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. That is why now more than ever the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and program reform. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> already is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions, budgeting by consensus, and the establishment of program priorities. These actions are extremely important. The progress on reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under congressional restrictions. I expect the reform program will continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal year. And let me say here we congratulate the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on the work it has done in three areas of special concern. First, our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism must continue. And we must also end the scourge of hostage taking. Second, the work of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in coordinating and advancing research on AIDS is vital. All international efforts in this area must be redoubled. The AIDS crisis is a grave one; we must move as one to meet it. So, too, is the drug crisis. We are moving now toward a new anti-drug trafficking convention. This important treaty will be completed in December. I am confident other strong <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> drug control programs will also follow. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are profoundly concerned, deeply angered. We will not tolerate the drug traffickers. We mean to make war on them _ and we believe this is one war the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can endorse and participate in.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Monday identified a group of `` whites only'' areas that could become <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s first legally integrated neighborhoods. Tens of thousands of non-whites already live illegally in the districts named in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by Constitutional Planning Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> listed districts in and near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> when he reintroduced a package of legislation dealing with the Group Areas Act, which segregates all neighborhoods by race. Neighborhoods are to become multiracial only where a majority of residents approve or where integration has occurred on a de facto basis. The package also includes proposals to tighten enforcement of the act in areas that remain segregated. The entire package is opposed by most anti-apartheid organizations, which say the Group Areas Act should be repealed rather than modified. `` If we do n't destroy it, it will destroy us,'' said <PERSON> Miley </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member, in regard to the act. Among the areas mentioned by <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s District Six _ a formerly multiracial area from which tens of thousands of mixed-race people were evicted after it was declared whites-only in 1966. Also mentioned was <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION>, an area of high-rise apartment buildings which is one of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s liveliest and most cosmopolitan neighborhoods. <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION>, like several of the areas named by <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, has become home to many Asians, blacks and people of mixed-race moving into inner-city housing vacated by whites who left for the suburbs. The proposal to allow multiracial neighborhoods has been denounced by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to makes gains in nationwide municipal elections next month at the expense of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-apartheid groups say the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is trying to appease right-wing voters by proposing tougher enforcement of the Group Areas Act, including sharply increased penalties for violators. The government also is proposing to crack down on occupants of substandard urban housing and illegal squatter camps _ moves which could affect millions of blacks. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said the government remained committed to protecting `` group rights'' _ its phrase for policies which allow whites-only schools, hospitals and residential areas. The Group Areas bills created a furor in Parliament when the government introduced them last month. The white chamber approved the measures, but the smaller mixed-race and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> chambers refused to discuss the bills. The government withdrew the bills, but decided to reintroduce them after the other chambers agreed to end their boycott. The nation's 26 million black majority is not represented in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s constitution, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ which controls <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s white chamber _ has the ability to enact bills even if the other two chambers reject them. The Group Areas Act has been the most bitterly debated issue in the municipal election campaign. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> city councilor in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> said he would lobby for multiracial areas in wards that vote for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but would seek to keep other white neighborhoods segregated. The councilor, <PERSON> Danie </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON>, was accused Monday of `` gutter politics'' by <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, the Progressive Federal leader in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said his party favored intergration nationwide, not just in selected neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Fire May Stand in Way of Reintroducing Wolves to Yellowstone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A controversial plan to reintroduce wolves in Yellowstone National Park may be stalled because of the fires that have raced through the area this summer, the chief naturalist for the area said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the fire turned the park into a sort of carnivore's smorgasbord, burning off the foliage and fallen deadwood that hid mice and other rodents as well as elk, deer and moose. `` I do n't ever remember having seen so many hawks in the sky before,'' he said. He said there are reports of grizzlies standing over the fire-felled carcasses of elk and deer, the same prey wolves would seek if they were in the park. `` Had the wolves been re-established prior to the fires, the timing would have been perfect,'' he said. The fires, which burned a million acres of timber, also may stand in the way of the controversial wolf program, in which at least 10 breeding pairs would be introduced into the park. `` My guess is we are n't going to have time to do much but assess the impact of the fire on the park for quite a while,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` I'd guess such projects as the wolf reintroduction will be pushed onto the back burner.'' Timber wolves, once plentiful in the mountains of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, were exterminated by hunters around the turn of the century. Their elimination created a gap in the park ecosystem, conservationists think. However, sheep and cattle ranchers in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the states <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> straddles, have opposed the reintroduction plan, fearing the wolves will prey on livestock outside the park. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> support the ranchers. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mech </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and Wildlife wolf specialist from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, thinks the ranchers fears are unfounded. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> is more susceptible to livestock predation than <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> the ranches are scattered like a mosaic throughout the wolves' territory. `` We have 1,200 wolves and 12,000 livestock ranches, yet only 40 to 50 complaints of wolves killing livestock,'' he added. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last week for a lecture at the Museum of Natural History, <PERSON> Mech </PERSON> said he had n't studied the situation in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, but based on the size of the elk herds it's obviously a prime habitat for wolves.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Exam For British Tourist Held In Fatal Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A British tourist accused of setting a fatal hotel fire after an argument with her boyfriend was ordered held without bail Monday, and a magistrate also ordered a psychological examination. <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Camberley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, was arrested last week on federal arson charges in the fire at the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. She faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted. Her boyfriend, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 20, was detained as a material witness, but has been released on $ 100,000 bond. Two people died of smoke inhalation in the Sept. 17 fire and one person was critically injured. Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> appeared Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Linnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Nobody would set a fire in which her money was burned up, all of her clothes, all of her documents _ it just does n't make sense,'' argued her attorney, <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. He said his client should be freed pending trial, saying her mother intends to come to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during proceedings. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> told the magistrate that Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was a flight risk and should be held. `` She's here only on a tourist visa and she has the means to leave,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> agreed Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> should remain in custody and, with <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s consent, ordered a psychologist to examine her. The psychological evaluation will be presented at a formal arraignment set Oct. 13. According to an affidavit filed by a federal agent in the case, Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> arrived at the Nassau Hotel on the night of Sept. 17. They went upstairs arguing, but <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> later returned to the lobby and spoke to the manager, leaving Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> alone in their room. She later joined him in the lobby, and while they talked passersby reported the fire. Federal agents and firefighters determined the fire was set and pinned it down to the time Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was in the room alone.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been trying to persuade the Afghan rebels not to attack departing Soviet troops, fearing this tactic could prompt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to back off its promise to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Monday. This is among the issues that a newly appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to the rebels, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> McWilliams </PERSON>, is expected to discuss with insurgent leaders operating out of base camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the officials said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> McWilliams </PERSON>' appointment Monday. He is a career diplomat who once served at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said some Afghan rebel factions believe that attacks on Soviet forces will ensure their prompt withdrawal. But they said the administration holds the opposite view. `` We do n't want Soviets to have any excuse to slow their withdrawal or to attack the Afghans,'' one official said. He added that the final decision on this and other operational matters is up to the rebels themselves. `` We do n't control their fighting activities, but we do present them with our views,'' the official said. On Friday, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> bitterly criticized the Pakistani role in supplying the Afghan rebels, even through the Soviets are continuing with their withdrawal schedule. He said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` is behaving as though it has no obligations'' under the agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> signed last April under which the Soviets promised to pull out their troops over a nine-month period. He proposed a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> this week involving the representatives of the signatory countries: the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Asked about the proposal, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said Monday the administration `` sees no need'' to have such a meeting. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not regard the Afghan government as legitimate and that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participation at a meeting with an Afghan official could be seen as a reversal of that policy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained for the past five months that it will show restraint in arming the Afghan rebels only if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> does the same with its ally in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been providing substantial support to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has continued its backing for the insurgents, the official said.

 Spotting a `` fundamental shift in society'' to recycling, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> said Monday they will form a new company to recycle plastic bottles. The as-yet unnamed 50-50 venture will retrieve from the trash of the two countries polyethylene terephthalate -LRB- PET -RRB- and high-density polyethylene -LRB- HDPE -RRB- plastics, which make up about 90 percent of the plastics used in bottles for milk, soft drinks and a variety of other products such as powdered detergents. <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified chemical and paper firm based in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, already operates paper and plastics recycling businesses. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Genson </PERSON>, business director for solid waste solutions for Dow, said the new company would build a pilot plant and then a commercial plant as early as 1990 at a location in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> still to be decided. <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> will collect the raw material and use the bulk of the output in its own industrial packaging and building materials products. Dow will sell some of the material it retrieves, the two companies said. Dow and <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> declined to estimate their expected investments or what the output would be used for or to detail the new technology developed by Dow that will be used in the plant. `` We have about 20 projects being evaluated in the corporation right now,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseneau </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> new business manager. The size of the plant has not been decided, but the two firms believe it will handle about 50 million pounds a year of PET and HDPE. About 900 million pounds of PET is sold each year, with 150 million pounds recycled currently. About three-quarters of original annual production goes into bottles; recycled material currently is not used for food and drink because of the chance of contamination. <ORGANIZATION> HDPE </ORGANIZATION> is one of the most widely used plastics and 7.82 billion pounds is produced every year, about 465 million pounds made by Dow. Some 2.1 billion pounds goes into bottles for milk and other household goods and another 342 million pounds goes into miscellaneous food packaging. Only about 2 percent is recycled One recycler, <ORGANIZATION> Eaglebrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that four HDPE bottles are thrown out for every PET bottle. `` We're entering the business confident that the waste management issue will make a fundamental shift in society and recycling systems will become the norm,'' <PERSON> Genson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Domtar </ORGANIZATION> will deal with recycling centers in areas with PET bottle return laws and `` waste recovery facilities expected to be established by states developing new recylcing programs,'' the companies said. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to exhort, persuade, push and nudge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents to recycle 25 percent of their garbage and trash by 1992, up from 10 percent now, because of the rapid exhaustion of landfill space in a throwaway society. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, 10 states have passed laws requiring recycling programs of one kind or another, with households separating recyclable material from food when they put out their garbage. The agency estimates that these programs operate in about 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communities.

 American <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said Monday he figured he had just five minutes to live after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hijackers shot a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver and threw him out of a commandeered <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. `` I made up my mind that if my turn was next _ I'm ready, but I'm not going to scream,'' <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said at the murder and air piracy trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The Lebanese Shiite Moslem is charged in the June 1985 hijacking in which <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23, was killed and 39 Americans held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> testified that said <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was alive when the hijackers threw the mortally wounded man on the runway at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport in 1985. `` I could hear him moaning,'' <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said. `` I fixed my mind on him. I tried to hear everything I could because I was blindfolded and could n't see.'' The court indictment states that <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> died of his wounds a short time after being thrown from the airplane. <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> testified that before <PERSON> Stetham </PERSON> was thrown from the plane <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said `` let the pig suffer'' when the chief flight attendant, <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON>, asked the hijackers if she could loosen <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s bound hands <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, had been taken to the plane's first - class section after the flight was diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` I heard a lot of screaming to the tower in Arabic, I could n't understand it,'' he testified `` Then I could hear <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> -RRB- scream,'' <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said. Other witnesses, including Mrs. <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON>, have said that <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> never made a sound during beatings he received by the hijackers. But <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON>, when asked about that testimony, maintained: `` I heard him scream.'' `` Then I hear a gunshot, the door open, and a second shot,'' said <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON>. `` At this point I just listened for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>, he was still alive and I could hear him moaning.'' Although he was blindfolded at the time, <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said he knew when the door opened `` because you can feel it with the draft, and the engines were louder.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, the pilot of flight 847, testified earlier at the trial that the engines were running when the hijackers shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said that after <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot, he heard one of the hijackers say in broken English: `` One more in five minutes.'' `` I felt I would be the next to die,'' <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, who have been attending the trial since it opened July 5, sat quietly listening to the testimony. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also sat impassively during <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON>' testimony. Later Monday, another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingalls </PERSON>, 27, testified he hid his military identification card from the hijackers and that he was `` roughed up a little when they found out about it,'' just before he was taken off the plane in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Asked to comment on Monday's testimony, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said in Arabic through his interpreter: `` I have nothing to say.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has acknowledged taking part in the hijacking, but denied having shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Jan. 13, 1987, after customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage. In the week following his arrest, two West Germans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Both captives have since been freed. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court on charges that he took part in the kidnappings in a failed effort to pressure <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into releasing <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today recommended that party propaganda chief <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> become <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced. The 61-year-old <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, a newspaper editor who became a Politburo member in December, would take over from Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> resigned with all 19 of his ministers last week following criticism over the handling of economic problems. The Sejm, or parliament, was to meet Tuesday to formally approve the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s choice of <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s ninth prime minister since World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> announcement came after a closed-door session in which the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sought a prime minister to cope with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s stagnant economy and steer the government during delicate negotiations next month with the opposition. The meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was chaired by party leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, and was addressed by Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and by party secretaries <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glowczyk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Others mentioned as possible candidates for prime minister were Politburo member and economist <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>; Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>; and alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>. Commentators ranging from Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to the official party weekly Polityka have said the appointment of a new government has limited significance because a fundamental change is needed in the system of governing. Diplomats and party sources suggest another government could be formed in a few months anyway, depending on the results of the talks scheduled with the opposition for mid-October. In that case, the new prime minister might be a temporary caretaker. Under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s system, the party controls the choice of government through its majority in parliament. The party sets the nation's priorities and it is up to the government to carry out the party's dictates. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, named his candidate for the prime minister's post Saturday to the leadership of PRON, a national patriotic group, the Polish news agency said. But there has been no public announcement of his choice. Whoever assumes the job of prime minister will have a daunting task. Confidence in the government is low, inflation is 60 percent annually, consumer goods are in short supply and workers are restive after recently staging two punishing waves of strikes. The last strike ended after authorities set aside their longstanding opposition to negotiating with Solidarity, agreeing to talks in mid-October to consider legalizing the trade union, banned since 1982. Last week <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, `` Personnel changes will not change anything, but systematic changes will.'' The sentiment was echoed by Polityka, which said last week in a front-page article, `` Crisis has affected the whole system of exercising power, and it is unlikely to be resolved by just new faces in government.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a farewell address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said today it is `` more than a possibility'' that a treaty curbing intercontinental ballistic missiles can be signed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> within the next year. In a speech at the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also called for an international conference to stop the use of poison gas and other chemical weapons. The president reviewed what he said has been progress toward peace in his administration, but added that `` history teaches us caution'' and that `` even in this time of hope, the chance of failure is real.'' He called upon <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to cooperate in implementing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution on their <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, saying, `` Let this war end now ... Let peace come.'' In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, he said, `` We encourage the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that the Afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference.'' The president condemned `` the continuing deterioration of human rights in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people and to the international community.'' He called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to `` assist in bringing the conflict in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars of arms and ammunition to the Sandinista regime'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. And he said he will `` continue to urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime'' on the Nicaraguan people. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, sitting with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, nodded as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke of progress on arms control. Members of the Nicaraguan delegation were expressionless as the president charged their country's Marxist-led government with repressive practices Turning to negotiations on long-range nuclear weapons, the president said, `` I can tell this assembly that it is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months, but I can tell you a year from now is a possibility, more than a possibility.'' Then, in an emotional passage, he said, `` Poison gas. Chemical warfare ... the terror of it. The horror of it. We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war _ beyond its tragic human toll _ jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I.'' The president urged nations that signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol outlawing such weapons and other concerned countries to `` convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has admitted using chemical weapons in its eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but claims <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also employed the banned substances. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has denied the allegation. In addition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using poison gas against its Kurdish minority. An announcement by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister last week indicated <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will no longer use chemical weapons against foreign or domestic adversaries. The president also said recent briefings he has received in the Oval Office on his Star Wars system for space-based misile defense `` indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid and less costly than we had at first thought.'' Noting that this would be his last address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> before he leaves office in January, the president said that `` if future generations do say of us that, in our time, peace came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice, it will be cause for pride.'' It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s seventh appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He has addressed the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> each year since 1983 and spoke at a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament in 1982. Before going to the General Assembly chamber for his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was greeted by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. When a reporter asked why there had been such a dramatic change in his views of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, of which he has been sharply critical in the past, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gestured to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and said, `` because of the gentleman present the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has changed dramatically.'' It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was releasing $ 188 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld from the organization to show displeasure with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budgetary and hiring practices. The president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had responded to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestions by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as the fact that the organization `` has started to play a more important role around the world in helping to deal with regional conflicts.'' After his speech, the president also met with Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and others. The White House announced today that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had decided to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoys of American-flagged ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> but will keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would discuss the change in meetings with heads of state from the region. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted `` after reviewing the current cease-fire ..., which has been in effect since Aug. 20, and consulting with allies and friends in the region,'' he said. There have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the cease-fire began. During his meeting with the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign ministers, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked why more progress had not been made during his administration toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` I think all of us would have liked to have made more progress than we did ... but it's not a complete failure. We're talking,'' he said.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared today his debate with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` went great,'' while running mate Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> proclaimed the vice president a clear victor in the nationally televised face-off. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> issued a clarification on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views on abortion, saying that the vice president would not sanction criminal penalties for women who obtain abortions _ despite the strong views he expressed in his debate Sunday night. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters here he had `` no change of mind at all'' on the subject as aides insisted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never favored criminal penalties for women who get abortions. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the first time since Labor Day, praised his running mate's performance. `` From the way you handled the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> last night, he would have been better off to take advice from his friends at the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> and exercised his right to remain silent,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' membership in the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, a group that supports civil rights. `` After last night, for most people the notion of President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion today, `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, playing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remark during the debate that people found the notion of ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' to be very troubling. `` One debate down. How'd I do?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of several thousand well-wishers who turned out for the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> rally at an outdoor railroad museum here. Earlier, as he left <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` went great,'' especially in seeking to portray his Democratic rival as a far-out liberal. Asked where he thought he'd hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the hardest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Make him be what he is ... you ca n't permit him to be something different.'' He promised to persist in preventing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor from moving to the ideological center. On abortion, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would favor criminal penalties for those performing illegal abortions but would oppose prosecuting women who obtain them. After stressing strong anti-abortion views during the debate, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided on further reflection that women who obtain abortions should be regarded as `` additional victims'' rather than criminals. `` After thinking about it overnight, we went in and discussed it this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed and we addressed it,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a debate questioner that `` I have n't sorted out the penalties'' he would impose under a constitutional amendment he seeks to outlaw abortions. `` ... I'm for the sanctity of life and, once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side and, of course, there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law whatever they may be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately responded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making that decision. It's as simple as that.'' That exchange left the issue an `` open question'' that needed to be clarified, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal, notwithstandng his views on the right to life,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Women would be seen as an additional victim.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it was the first time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had dealt with the question of penalties _ `` choice vs. right to life'' and `` he has dealt with it.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have criminal penalties apply only to those performing abortions if the procedure became illegal. The vice president's campaign chief said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the debate over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by `` coming across as warm, as human and as likable'' while successfully portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters he also thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the debate. `` I think the vice president ... was ebullient, I think he was the one who was stating the facts and the truth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed satisfaction after the debate and declared, `` I am not going to let this man move to the center and get away from his past.'' `` I believe that he will be outstanding,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during the debate. The vice president told a noisy crowd of 400 to 500 supporters at a post-debate rally Sunday night that the session with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent was a good chance to highlight the differences between them. `` Tonight we had a little debate over there -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` It is my firm belief that we had an opportunity to spell out my dreams and my objectives and I am not going to let this man move to the center and get away from his past,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. During the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly sought to characterize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a liberal. But, unlike many of his aides, he did not claim a clear victory in the debate. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave repeated thumbs-up signs to his audience of supporters, who crowded into a barn at a local fairgrounds to shout, ring cowbells and cheer for their candidate. While awaiting the public opinion polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides were quick to declare laurels for their man. `` I think it was a clear win for the vice president,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` He did an extraordinarly good job, in our opinion.''

 Two months after the wife of one of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s richest men was abducted from her home, authorities said Monday they have no clues on the woman's welfare or whereabouts. The last contact with <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was a letter dated Aug. 10 to her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s worth reportedly exceeds $ 100 million `` We are working just as hard and intensely at the end of two months as we did at the end of two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` We are just hoping it will be resolved quickly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was abducted sometime between 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. July 26. Small spots of blood were found inside and outside the front door of the two-story house in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. A crudely phrased typewritten note left behind instructed <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to pay an unspecified amount of money to people he allegedly had wronged. The people named in the letter are current or former franchisers with <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was once the largest stockholder. The company sued the 12 people in the early 1980s, claiming the franchisers owed money from operating loans, materials and film-processing fees. On Aug. 23, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials announced that <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> had followed the instructions and that a total of about $ 1 million was mailed to the 12 named in the letter _ or their survivors _ on Aug. 16, the day after <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> received a handwritten letter from his wife. The note had an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmark. In addition to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> and partner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> oil man, own controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Trustmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats said today that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> have effectively killed chances of raising the $ 3.35 minimum wage this year through a five-day filibuster. `` There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was I regret that. I would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The bill by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., would have raised the wage floor, which has been at its present level since 1981, to $ 3.75 in January, $ 4.15 in 1990 and $ 4.55 in 1991 <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said it would have directly benefited some 15 million workers now paid less than $ 4.55 an hour. `` I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` This bill could n't pass the House. It was n't going to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unless it was modified. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats had attempted twice, the last time on Friday, to invoke cloture to end the filibuster. Both attempts failed.

 <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, selected Monday to become <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, is known as an advocate of reform but a fierce opponent of the banned Solidarity trade union. A man of peasant origins who rose to become one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leading journalists and then deputy prime minister, the 61-year-old <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> joined the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 15 and was put in charge of propaganda <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s appointment to the Politburo represented a political comeback after being dropped from the government in 1985. A protege of Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became unpopular with leaders of Solidarity during the 15 months it was legal in 1980-81. He was in charge of the government's committee for trade unions and was the authorities' chief negotiator with Solidarity He also played a major role in defending the suppression of the union after the introduction of martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. And in August 1983, he went to the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> to attack Solidarity and defend the martial-law crackdown in a steamy meeting in which he was jeered and hooted by workers. The grey-haired <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> took off his tie and rolled up his shirt sleeves for the televised confrontation, but failed to win over much of the work force which instead cheered Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became deputy prime minister on Feb. 12, 1981, and held the post until his ouster in November 1985. Afterwards, he held a largely ceremonial position as deputy speaker of the Sejm, or parliament. Born to a peasant family in the village of <LOCATION> Kowalewek </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Dec. 1, 1926, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was a teen-age laborer during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and served in the Polish army from the time of the liberation until 1949. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1946 and was a party political worker in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> from 1949 to 1952. He then attended the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in the capital until 1957. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became editor-in-chief of the party weekly Polityka in 1958, a post he held until 1982, and gave it a reputation as a progressive center within the official press and winning him the distrust of conservatives within the party. In a widely circulated memorandum on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political situation written before his appointment to the Politburo, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> backed further democratization and economic reform. But he urged the party to be more defined in its political struggle against Solidarity, saying the party must make clear its ideological goals and defend them. In the nine months since <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> took over official propaganda, the state media has become more open in distributing information about the opposition but has been aggressive in attacking opposition views. Jamming of Western radio stations such as Radio Free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has ceased, but the official media has stepped up rebuttals of reports heard on the stations.

 A gunman entered an elementary school today and calmly opened fire, killing one pupil, wounding 10 other people and sending terrified youngsters fleeing into the woods, authorities and witnesses said. Police have a suspect in custody, said Police Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON>, spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Self </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, said eight children and two teachers were brought there, all suffering from gunshot injuries. Six of the 10 were treated and released and four were being admitted, including a child who was in critical condition, he said. Children ran from the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> into adjacent woods when the man opened fire about 11 a.m., the The -LRB- <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> -RRB- Index-Journal reported. Janitor <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, a witness to part of the shooting, said he was n't sure where it started, but the man was in the lunchroom shooting then went down the hall shooting into classrooms. Physical education aide <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said after the suspect quit shooting, he threw the pistol down and walked out of the building as if nothing was wrong. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said he held the suspect until police arrived. He described the man as a hefty white male in his mid-20s. `` He remained calm and offered no resistance,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. The school was evacuated as state troopers, police officers, sheriff's deputies and school officials arrived. Officers and volunteers combed the woods for a time after the shooting, looking for children who might be hiding. <ORGANIZATION> Greenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 50 Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said about noon that all he knew was that an unidentified man came into the building and started shooting children and teachers. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said it did n't appear the man had any connection with the school. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Amick </PERSON>, a first-grade teacher, said she and her students fled the cafeteria after she saw a man waving a gun around. They exited through a back door and ran toward the woods. Later, they joined other groups of students on the lawn in front of the school, and teachers checked rolls to count the students. Children were allowed to go home after they were accounted for. Some volunteers called parents to let them know their children were all right. Ms. <PERSON> Amick </PERSON> said she comforted her students by telling them everyone in their class was OK. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> is a town of about 22,000 in western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, some 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Just last week, a man later identified <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> shot and killed two people in a store in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, then walked across the street to a school, killing a school janitor and a policewoman before he was killed by another police In that case, no pupils or teachers were injured, but on May 20, an 8-year-old boy was killed and six other people were injured when a woman went on a rampage in and around a school in the affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Grateful Dead's long, strange career took a new turn when the 23-year-old rock band staged a benefit concert for preservation of the world's tropical rain forests. A boisterous crowd of colorfully clad deadheads _ the group's legion of devoted fans _ seemed in shock several times during the almost six-hour concert Saturday night at packed Madison Square Garden While the band, an icon of the psychedelic 1960s, has played benefits before, they called this show the first act in a lifetime commitment to the rain forest issue. Some fans were surpised to hear the Dead push a cause. But a real blow was the labored singing of lead guitarist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, whose ragged, cracking voice showed the exhaustion of ending a three-week East Coast tour with nine shows in 11 nights in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Overshadowing those anomalies, though, was the participation of other popular musicians. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> and the Range kicked off the show with an energetic 75-minute set. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> also joined the Dead for a jam on `` Not Fade Away.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> guitarist <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> accompanied the Dead for two songs, trading leads with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> on `` West L.A. Fadeaway'' and the blues standard, `` Little Red Rooster.'' Folksinger <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> also performed. But the real high point came when <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> came on stage, bouncing like jumping beans in the midst of the always-placid <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and rhythm guitarist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>. The musicians launched into an energetic `` Everytime You Go Away,'' with <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> singing the lead and Hall providing falsetto accompaniments. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> stood to the side, laying down lead runs during appropriate intervals but generally looking confused. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>'s `` What's Going' On,'' written in the early'70s at the height of the ecology movement, also got an enthusiastic response from the audience. Another highlight was bass player <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesh </PERSON>'s enthusiastic rendition of the Dead classic `` Box of Rain.'' The group also unveiled a banner from the rafters of the Garden. Decorated in the tie-dyed colors favored by Deadheads and bearing the number 25, it represented the 25 shows the band has played in the Garden, the most by any rock group. For the finale, <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> and bass player <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Casady </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airplane </LOCATION> and Hot Tuna, joined in `` Good Lovin'' and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s `` Knockin' on Heaven's Door.'' Throughout the night, performers and video messages reminded patrons who paid up to $ 250 a seat about the cause. Tropical rain forests are lush jungles located near the equator, primarily in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, rain forests cover 7 percent of the globe and contain 5 million to 30 million species of plants, animals and insects. Environmentalists and scientists contend that deforestation _ through cattle ranching, farming, timber harvesting and land development _ contributes to the global warming trend known as the greenhouse effect. It is caused by increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that traps heat, similar to glass in a greenhouse. Scientists say that left unchecked, it would melt the polar ice caps, causing ocean levels to rise. Rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Leaflets distributed at the show urged people to write politicians, foreign leaders and financial institutions in a plea to halt projects that destroy rain forests. Proceeds from the show, expected to exceed $ 600,000, were to be distributed among environmental groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Rainforest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, Cultural Survival and <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>.

 Army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> failed Monday to win <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> recognition for his fledgling Christian military Cabinet in a struggle for power with a rival Syrian-backed Moslem government. None of three Arab envoys who attended a meeting at the presidential palace called by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> apparently made any commitment to his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, while other Arab envoys boycotted the session. At the same time, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which supports the rival Moslem government led by <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, stepped up its criticism of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 4-day-old, three-man Cabinet <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s rejection of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has sharpened sectarian tensions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and threatened to formalize the country's de facto partition into Christian and Moslem areas carved out during the 13-year-old civil war. President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed fellow <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aoun </ORGANIZATION> prime minister in a six-man interim military Cabinet on Thursday, five minutes before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended. Parliament repeatedly failed to elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, who was barred from seeking a second, consecutive term. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who was acting prime minister under <PERSON> Genayel </PERSON>, insisted that his five-man Cabinet, all that was left of a fractured national government under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, was the legitimate authority. Three Moslem army officers <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named to serve in <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s government refused to serve But the general insisted his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> had legally inherited <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s powers and constituted <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s legitimate government <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s action in naming <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> violated an unwritten convenant dating from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence in 1943 under which the president must be a Maronite, the premier a Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem. The only envoys to respond to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s call for a meeting Monday were Iraqi Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Sabbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Hadithi </PERSON>, Tunisian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>, and the head of the Egyptian interest section, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shash </PERSON>. An aide said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> asked them to `` inform your governments that the Cabinet appointed by President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> before his term ended is the legitimate executive body in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The representatives of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, who are based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, refused to attend the meeting, an action interpreted in some circles as reflecting their country's disapproval of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet The envoys who attended the meeting were non-committal on the issue of recognition. `` We expressed to Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> our hope that the Lebanese would agree on the election of a new president to unite the country and avert the evil of partition,'' <PERSON> Shash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hadithi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> envoy, said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> supports `` the election of a new president and supports <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity.'' <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> gave `` us an explanation of the current situation. We will relay it to officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>.'' The Iraqi and Egyptian diplomats are based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, has been openly challenging <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s grip on Moslem-held areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Other influential Arab countries such as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, have had no missions in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for several years because of the violence. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> both held meetings during the weekend with envoys of the five member states of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ as the two Cabinets battled for recognition. But so far none of those governments has committed itself. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lenanon </LOCATION>, is the only country to have declared its support for either of the rival Cabinets. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Baath </ORGANIZATION> daily, which speaks for Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, warned that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian administrations will not last `` If the three-man military rule which usurped power ... thinks it is going to last, then it's belief is wrong,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Al-Baath </ORGANIZATION> editorial said.

 Four mines have been discovered in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> recently, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval officers say shipping will be endangered if rough winter weather rips more mines from their moorings. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers said Monday that three of the mines were spotted drifting on the surface after breaking loose from their seabed anchors. `` As winter approaches, the waters in the northern gulf get a lot rougher, and that's when the anchored mines are more likely to break away. They're also harder to spot,'' said one officer. `` We're very concerned that the situation is going to get worse in the immediate future.'' The warning was issued as this 3,600-ton missile frigate arrived off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, escorting what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said could be the next-to-last convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers to be protected by American warships. The White House announced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has decided to end the `` tight escort'' of vessels, opting instead for `` accompanying'' them with warships posted along the way to provide any assistance needed. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acted `` after reviewing the cease-fire'' between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> which began Aug. 20, and `` consulting with allies and friends in the region.'' Aboard Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> later addressed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships would still `` take appropriate action if American-flagged ships are directly threatened.'' Administration officials said last week they are considering the `` zone defense'' plan, citing reduced gulf tensions and prospects for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force cutback of at least one ship. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 26 warships in the region, 16 in the gulf. The military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a convoy scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on Tuesday would likely be the last escorted the entire 550-mile voyage through the gulf. The <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> was designated as escort for the 81,283-ton oil products carrier <LOCATION> Surf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been escorting 11 Kuwaiti tankers reflagged with the Stars and Stripes since July 1987 to protect them from Iranian attack. Monday's convoy, the 67th this year and the 89th since `` Operation Earnest Will'' began, brought the 294,739-ton tanker <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> up the gulf to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. A second tanker, the U.S.-owned Overseas Valdez, dropped off at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. As they neared <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> early Monday, the <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> and its massive charge sailed through waters where the missile frigate <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a sister ship of the <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON>, spotted a floating mine Saturday. It was destroyed by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers. A Kuwaiti cargo vessel reported a similar discovery Friday near Hout island, 40 miles northwest of the Taylor sighting. The officers said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweeper's sonar located a mine Aug. 19 on the seabed in a `` mine danger area'' near Iran-owned <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where dozens of mines had been cleared earlier. A day earlier, the <PERSON> Vandegrift </PERSON> was patrolling near two secret <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> barges in the same area when bridge lookouts spotted a mine bobbing 100 yards off the port side. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said all the mines were 500-pound M-08 contact devices that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is known to have sown widely, and each was safely disposed of. All were covered with marine growth, indicating they had been in the water for some time, the officers noted. Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, `` commodore'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweeping force in the gulf, estimated two months ago that despite the recovery of scores of mines, `` a couple of hundred'' remain, mostly in northern waters near <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and mostly laid by the Iranians.

<TEXT>
 Six to seven dozen wild horses have been shot dead in an isolated stretch of central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Monday. In addition to the remains of 73 animals found last week, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> investigators have turned up a dozen more carcasses of wild horses, along with spent bullets and other evidence, said bureau spokeswoman <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON>. She said the bureau has n't determined exactly how many horses have been killed because a few of the original 73 remains spotted by helicopter turned out to be cattle that died of natural causes. The carcasses and bones are strewn along an area one to two miles wide and about eight miles long. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> has said the horses apparently were shot over a six-month period starting about a year ago. The remote area includes canyons and rolling benchland about 30 miles north of the tiny central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and about 15 miles west of the highway linking <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> was tipped by a person who was questioned about an earlier rifle slaughter of 41 horses whose remains were discovered 30 miles away in August. The bureau did not identify the person. More than 38,000 wild horses now run the open range in 10 western states. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s herds are the largest, with estimates of up to 28,000 horses roaming the state.

<HEAD>Corporate Economists Predict Slower Economy In 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economists from major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations are predicting the economy will slow next year _ bad news for presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who are both counting on strong growth to help them reduce the federal budget deficit. A panel of 60 economists from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> are bullish about growth this year, predicting an expansion of 3.9 percent as measured by the gross national product. That's even more optimistic than the administration's forecast of 3.5 percent However, the median forecast for next year is an anemic 2.3 percent, substantially less than the administration forecast of 3.1 percent. Nearly half of the economists _ 47 percent _ said in a survey in late August and early September that they expect the country to topple into a recession by the end of next year. Another 42 percent believe a recession will occur in 1990. Only 11 percent believe the six-year-old economic expansion will continue into 1991 or later. That's slightly more optimistic than a similar survey in May when 57 percent said the recession would come in 1989. `` For business economists, a group often accused of an inability to reach agreement on anything, the fact that 90 percent ... expect an economic downturn during the next two years is noteworthy,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and incoming president of the association, which is holding its 30th annual meeting in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> this week. Republicans are looking for strong growth the rest of this year to boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into the presidency, and the economists are optimistic he'll win. They boosted their projection from 2.9 percent in May to 3.9 percent, even though the summer drought is expected to knock a full percentage point off GNP growth. Fifty-three percent of a larger panel of 300 association members believes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win, while 37 percent think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democrat, will be elected. A more lopsided majority, 62 percent vs. 22 percent, believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies would better maintain stable growth and moderate inflation. However, the economists _ who identified the budget deficit as the No. 1 economic problem facing the next president _ were pessimistic that either candidate will be able to accomplish much on the deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has vowed not to raise taxes and has proposed a tax cut for capital gains, said on a nationally televised debate Sunday night that he'll whittle the deficit with a `` flexible freeze'' that will permit the president to cut spending in some programs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who says he will turn to a tax increase only as last resort, said at the debate that he will get tougher with tax cheats, cut some military programs and encourage growth. However, by a 3-to-1 margin, the 300-member economists' panel predicted no major deficit reduction package would be enacted in 1989. A majority, 51 percent, said there would be no great difference between a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration in the chances of a package being adopted. Twenty-eight percent said they believed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have a better chance, versus 20 percent who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That probably reflects an assumption that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would find it easier to work with a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The median deficit projection for next year was $ 150 billion, about the same as last year's budget gap and the deficit expected in fiscal year 1988. Other economic policy priorities, listed in order of importance after shrinking the budget deficit, were: completing the free trade agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; speeding up productivity growth; encouraging personal savings; and stimulating business investment. Near the bottom of the economists' list was curbing hostile corporate takeovers, discouraging corporate debt accumulation, increasing antitrust law enforcement, reforming securities laws to prevent another stock market crash and changing federal law to allow banks to enter the securities industries. In other predictions, the 60-member panel said: _ Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index will kick up, from a projected 4.5 percent this year to 5.1 percent next year The administration is looking for inflation of 3.9 percent in 1989. _ Interest rates, both short - and long-term, should rise a full percentage point by mid-1989 and then start to _ The merchandise trade deficit of $ 170 billion in 1987 will shrink to $ 135 billion this year and $ 120 billion next year _ Sixty-two percent believe the value of the dollar, which has rebounded somewhat over the past six months, will remain stable this year, and 55 percent believe it will slip next year

 A priest told more than 1,000 mourners at the funeral of a slain police officer Monday to be anguished over cuts in services for the mentally ill, saying the killer `` needed more help, more love and more understanding.'' Amid the wail of bagpipes, scores of police officers saluted the casket carrying the body of Officer <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> was one of four people killed by <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, 40, during a shooting rampage Thursday at a store and school. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> also died. As police stood at attention under a blue sky, the <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a police drum and bagpipe corps, played a dirge while pallbearers carried the casket into Christ The King church on the city's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. `` If we are to be anguished and upset today, perhaps we should be anguished and upset at those who are cutting and continue to cut resources for our mentally ill,'' the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> told mourners. `` Perhaps that is what killed <PERSON> Irma </PERSON>, because there was a person who needed more help, more love and more understanding than our institutions provided him,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Oct. 5 presidential referendum in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> will occur in a political climate dominated by fear as the military continues a successful strategy of using torture to control people, a study of the country concludes. The report, `` Sowing Fear: The Uses of Torture and Psychological Abuse in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' is based on a four-year investigation by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area-based Physicians for Human Rights. The organization claims that an atmosphere of terror has been accelerated in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> by the emergence of paramilitary vigilante squads which are responsible for kidnappings, rape, torture and murders. In the referendum, voters will determine whether to elect General <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to eight more years as president or to have an open election in a year. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> came to power after the military overthrew the socialist government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in 1973. `` Let's not be deceived by elections in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ it's a country gripped by fear,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, the executive director of the 1,000-member group and one of the physicians who interviewed alleged torture victims. `` In <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> you find a carefully planned program of state terror, a scientific approach to intimidation designed so the country will be paralyzed by fear and wo n't go against the government,'' Fine said. Two other human rights reports released early this year said <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s human rights situation was improving, but some repression continued. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in an 18-page report that the number of `` disappearances'' has dropped sharply since 1977, but has not stopped completely. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> report said human rights violations including torture continue in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but the overall situation is improving. More than 700 people have disappeared during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule, most of them in a wave of repression following the 1973 coup, according to international and local human rights groups. The physicians' report said in many instances entire communities have been intimidated and terrorized by state security agencies. The primary targets are usually the poor, social and political activists and those involved in human rights issues. The report includes graphically detailed case histories of alleged torture victims, information gathered during seven trips to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> made by the organization from 1984 to 1988 where more than 100 such people were interviewed. Most of those who said they were tortured were kidnapped and subjected to brutal treatment, including the use of electric current on the the genital area, beatings, threats, sleep deprivation and rape and sexual violation. The most frequently reported psychological torture, according to the report, involves threats to family and friends, the forced presence of friends and close relatives during torture sessions and interrogation while blindfolded and nude. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Informaciones </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s secret police, is believed reponsible for the bulk of the terrorism and tortures, according to the report.

 Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and wounded 67 in the occupied lands on Monday, hospital officials said, and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency claimed the army was resorting to gunfire too often to quell the unrest. `` There is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition that can not be justified,'' said a senior official of the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our concern is very real. This is not just a knee-jerk reaction to a bad day.'' The Israeli army rejected the criticism. The number of Palestinians wounded Monday was the second highest since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. As many as 90 Palestinians were wounded during protests against the April 16 assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. Monday's clashes came as Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied lands to protest the detention of thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. During the protests, white sheets sprayed with red swastikas were attached to electricity polls in the biblical city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The number of Palestinian casualties in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> jumped from 19 in July to 130 in September, not counting Monday's wounded, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said figures for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were being compiled. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency, which aids Palestinian refugees, filed a complaint with the army, the official said. He also blamed the growing casualty toll to the army's introduction in August of plastic bullets which penetrate the body like live ammunition, but generally are not fatal unless fired from less than 60 feet An army spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, rejected the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency complaint, and blamed the increase in casualties on more violent Palestinian protests, not more liberal use of gunfire. He also said plastic bullets served as a deterrent while avoiding fatal injuries. In clashes in the <PERSON> Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukaber </PERSON> district in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, riot police fatally shot 19-year-old <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON> in the mouth, said officials at the city's <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. He was the first Palestinian reported killed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> during the uprising. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the death was under investigation. Initial reports showed police fired only tear gas and rubber bullets, not live ammunition, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. An Israeli photographer said he heard several shots and minutes later saw six masked Palestinians carry <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON> to a car. One of the youths held <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON>'s arm with one hand and flashed a victory sign with the other. About 4,000 people attended <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON>'s funeral, chanting <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> slogans and waving outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags.

 A Cabinet minister who had been helping rebuild a region devastated by the 5-year-old civil war in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> was shot to death Monday near a Buddhist temple. The military said three unidentified assailants opened fire on <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayatilleke </PERSON>'s car, killing him and seriously injuring two bodyguards. The Joint Operations Command said the shooting occurred in <LOCATION> Kuliyapitiya </LOCATION>, 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jayatilleke </PERSON>, 64, served as education minister and as minister of rehabilitation and reconstruction. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing. Military officials who requested anonymity said they suspected the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese extremist group that has vowed to kill anyone who supports a July 1987 accord aimed at ending the ethnic dispute that was wracked the island's north and east. Members of the front have been accused of trying to assassinate President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> in August 1987. <PERSON> Jayatilleke </PERSON>, a former teacher, had served as minister of education since July 1977. Last year, he was appointed minister of rehabilitation and reconstruction and assigned to re-open schools and restore civil services to the war-torn provinces. He spent the last two months touring the north and east, talking to ethnic groups left homeless by the war. Tamils, mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. They claim they have been denied jobs and military appointments by the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most militant group, briefly accepted the accord, but later reneged, claiming it failed to meet enough demands. Militant Sinhalese also claim the accord makes too many concessions. They have been blamed for 450 killings, including government and security personnel. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the conflict because 60 million Tamils living in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are sympathetic to the rebel cause. An estimated 47,000 Indian troops have been stationed on the island trying to enforce the accord. About 8,500 people have died in the fighting, including at least 575 Indian soldiers.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s official youth union on Monday blamed the political system of this crisis-ridden communist country for ethnic clashes and warned the conflict could develop into a civil war. A top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official resigned to protest the mass rallies by <LOCATION> Serb </LOCATION> nationalists against ethnic Albanians in the poor, southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement addressed to the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> people and carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, blamed the `` almost totally inefficient political system'' for `` a situation which is closer to fratricidal war than progressive solution of the problems.'' The youth union also called on officials to battle <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s `` economic and social collapse'' through free elections and a open-market economy In addition to increasing ethnic tensions, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is battling a 200 percent annual inflation rate, a $ 21 billion foreign debt, a 15 percent unemployment rate and increasing labor unrest. `` The current situation in the country is characterized by fears of violence ... poverty and hopelessness,'' the statement said. In <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the Moslem Albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million population and are fighting to win a greater voice in governing their autonomous province, now administered by the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The Christian Slavs, formed by Serbs and Montenegrins, claim they are the victims of Albanian arson and street attacks, are calling on <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to completely absorb the province. Franc Setinc, a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Monday over recent rallies by tens of thousands of Slavs who have chanted demands for arms to fight the Albanians. Serbian party boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> backed the protests and demanded tough measures against Albanian separatists, who are demanding their own republic free of the 200,000 Slav minority. In a resignation letter sent to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Setinc </PERSON> said he `` is concerned by slogans ` We want arms!' and the like that call for a blaze in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' `` We are doing little to stop the insanity that ... is driving us into catastrophe,'' added <PERSON> Setinc </PERSON>, one of the highest officials to resign since the communists came to power after World War II. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has denounced Setinc and several other communist officials at the rallies, and his supporters claim non-Serbian officials have prevented action to stop ethnic strife in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. `` I am afraid of people who manipulate with hardships and emotions of Serbs and Montenegrins in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Setinc </PERSON> said in an apparent reference to <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and other Serbian leaders. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s leaders say the rallies could imperil the fragile ethnic balance in this nation that stretches from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, or even lead to civil war. The animosity in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, exacerbated by the rallies, is now so high that many residents believe a military crackdown will come within months, or even weeks. Police in armored personnel carriers have been sent to the province by the federal government in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, about 2,000 Slav schoolchildren continued to boycott their classes Monday to protest alleged harassment by ethnic Albanian classmates, sources said. The elementary and high school students have not attended classes since Thursday, when they staged a street protest. The students, who belong to Serb and Montenegrin minorities, also marched Friday. They apparently were kept at home Monday by parents fearing possible confrontations with ethnic Albanians, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Slav students say they will not return to classes until a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in early October results in decisive action against the Albanians.

<DATELINE>CARDIFF, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A one-ton leatherback turtle found washed up dead on a Welsh beach could be the largest of its species ever recorded, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` It appears to be a world record,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, keeper of zoology at the museum in <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` We had to weigh it on a crane and it scaled 2,000 pounds. It is 8 -LCB- feet long from its head to the end of its tail and nearly 10 feet wide, measured across the flippers. I doubt whether they grow much bigger,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` There are earlier reports of leatherbacks approaching this size but this seems to be the heaviest recorded,'' he said. The turtle, found Thursday on <LOCATION> Harlech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cardigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, was driven to <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION> by a nature warden where it was put in the museum's deep freeze. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said reports of leatherbacks in Welsh waters were `` very rare'' and all were females. This one was a male and was thought to have come from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` They live in the tropics and feed on jellyfish and as we have had lots of jellyfish in Welsh waters this year it probably was pursuing them,'' he said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said that while most stranded turtles are injured in collisions with ships this turtle had not been injured before it died at sea from an unknown cause. `` We've done an autopsy and tests on its parasites, like barnacles, should show where it came from,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> departed from a generally conciliatory speech Monday to deliver a tongue-lashing to a handful of nations for abusing human rights, singling out the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and others. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared that `` the regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those who starve in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, those who die among the Kurds, those who face racial injustice in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, those who still can not write or speak freely in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, those who can not worship in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, those who struggle for life and freedom on boats in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, those who can not publish or assemble in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> _ all of this is more than just an agenda item on your calendar,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the delegates from 159 nations. `` It must be a first concern; an issue above others,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> drew about a minute of applause but no standing ovation, except among members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> sat stony-faced during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism. He left afterward by a private exit and offered no comment to reporters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> reference was to refugees fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and his mention of Kurds was prompted by allegations <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used poison gas to crush a rebellion by its Kurdish minority. Of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` for years, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a blatant violator of its citizens' human rights, has escaped <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> censure or even scrutiny.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to examine <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s human rights policies. `` <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has already begun to free some political prisoners, improve prison conditions, and tolerate the existence of a small, independent national human rights group,'' he said. Few foreign officials had comment on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attacks. But <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> singled out his country out of frustration because `` he accepts that his policy is a total failure, ... the policy of paying mercenaries this policy of eight years of war.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supports the rebels, known as Contras, in the civil war against the leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the permanent observer of the League of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has said previously there is no evidence <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons against the Kurds. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> also has criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for allegedly bowing to `` Zionist'' pressures. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> did question <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s failure to mention the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the political standoff between Christians and Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> itself may have had the keenest interest in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech.

 Ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbon compounds could be even worse than previously thought, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in urging a stepped up attack on <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use worldwide. Separately, the major trade association of producers and users of CFCs said for the first time the world should aim at `` phasing out ... CFCs to the maximum extent feasible.'' `` The depletion that has already occurred calls into question our earlier projections of future damage,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said in releasing a new assessment of future concentrations of chlorine in the atmosphere. `` Regretfully, our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario than anticipated.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' call for ending all <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use was a switch from his position that there was plenty of time for participants in last year's treaty to decide what, if any, further steps were necessary. That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories to a 50 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production in 1998. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has been urging the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> to accelerate the scientific review called for by the treaty, and an informal review will convene in The Hague next month. Environmentalists, who have been calling for an end to <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use for months, hailed <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement. `` It underlines the seriousness of the emergency we are facing,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> of the Natural Resources Defense Council. `` This kind of report will have a lot of impact'' on major producing countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We're glad to see they've come around to our way of thinking,'' said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and foam blowing agents and, outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as aerosol propellants. Related bromine compounds are used in fire extinguishers. Some of them can last for more than a century, rising to the stratosphere where they eventually break down to liberate chlorine. A major study of ozone by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in March found ozone depletion of a few percent at mid-latitudes and attributed it to chlorine. The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> panel's work prompted some major producers of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds to announce their intention to develop harmless substitutes. The trade group, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, said its new recommendation grew out of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> report. Up to now, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that it would take an 85 percent reduction in one of the major <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds to keep chlorine from growing. But this estimate did not include low-potency <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds outside the treaty and non-CFC sources of chlorine, notably methyl chloroform, the most widely used industrial solvent. The report focused on chlorine concentrations to avoid the uncertainties of trying to predict ozone depletion. Any increase in chlorine and bromine increases the risk of ozone depletion, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, co-author of the report, said, `` You ask the atmospheric chemists for a prediction -LRB- of ozone -RRB- and they wo n't give you one'' because their computer models failed to predict the ozone depletion that has occurred so far _ spectacularly so for the annual `` hole'' over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> that sees ozone decline by half every September Currently, average chlorine in the stratosphere is about 2.7 parts per billion. This concentration would triple or double by 2075, depending on whether methyl chloroform use increases or not, even if the entire world abides by last year's treaty, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> found. `` An immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all -LRB- the most powerful -RRB- compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be needed'' to stabilize chlorine, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Immediate'' means 1990, and the actions would have to cover all countries. The `` most likely'' restrictions necessary for stability would call for `` conservative'' use of low-potency replacement compounds, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. If one pound of these compounds were used for every five pounds of major compounds given up, the world could increase use of the substitute compounds by 4 percent per year. This would keep chlorine concentration at about 1985 levels in 2060 and hold the increase by 2100 to less than 1 ppb, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In fact, delaying a full phaseout from 1998 to 2008 increases the maximum chlorine level by about 0.7 ppb and delays the decline back to 1985 levels by about 70 years,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said.

He said then another lawyer should be prepared to begin the trial if <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> was not present. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s renewed request for a delay Monday, and then asked <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> if he wanted to fire his local attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON>, a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` If you want him to stay and try this case, I'll force him to stay,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> replied: `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> is my attorney, and I feel like I'm being forced to make this decision, and my constitutional rights are being violated.'' <PERSON> Nakel </PERSON> withdrew as <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s attorney and <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> then called <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, to the front of the courtroom and asked <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> if he would accept her as his trial attorney. But <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> continued to repeat that <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> was his attorney. `` Well, he's not here,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` Will you take Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>?'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> is my attorney,'' said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>. `` His answer, for the record, is no,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had chosen to defend himself. `` No, your honor, I have had that decision forced on me against my constitutional rights,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> told the attorneys to introduce themselves to 28 prospective jurors, <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> stood up and said: `` Your honor, I am not allowed to have my chosen counsel present, so I do not have anything to say to the jury.'' Several prospective jurors said they believed the defendants were guilty. Four said they'd never heard of the case. `` In a country which consistently insists that criminal defendants are entitled to counsel of their choice, it is a disgrace for a federal judge, sworn to uphold the Constitution to deny this right to anyone and particularly, a native American who faces a potential punishment of life in prison,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said in a statement issued from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> claim membership in the Tuscarora tribe, an Indian faction affiliated with the Lumbee tribe in southeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> have said they committed the act to draw attention to allegations of drug trafficking and corruption in the county. The 10-hour siege at the newspaper ended after Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to form a state task force to investigate their corruption charges. But <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> met only once with the task force, which issued a preliminary report saying it had found little evidence to back up their charges. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and their supporters said the task force did not do a thorough investigation, and that potential witnesses would not testify without federal and state immunity. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> disappeared Aug. 31 after a federal appeals court revoked his bond. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> surrendered to marshals in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> the same day. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> one week ago when he stepped off a plane with a <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> associate.

 Official Soviet media said Monday that life was strained but slowly returning to normal in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The evening television news program `` Vremya'' said children had returned to school in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, but a curfew remained in effect and many state-run enterprises were not working. The predominantly Armenian population of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a territory that's part of the southern Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, is seeking annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, leading to clashes, demonstrations and strikes. National authorities rejected the demand. `` Vremya'' showed clear blue skies in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> as schoolchildren and other residents walked along city streets. One teacher, interviewed in front of a school by a TV correspondent, denied that <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> residents forced their children to stay away from school and take part in demonstrations. She said that because of the tense atmosphere in the region, `` Our small children have become grown-ups in their heads.'' On Sept. 18, Armenians and <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> exchanged gunfire in <LOCATION> Khadzhaly </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, and one man was killed. Soviet officials have said 48 people were wounded in the shooting and in arson attacks and other acts of violence in the following days. <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> residents have been holding meetings, demonstrations and strikes to support annexation. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers moved in last Wednesday, sealing off streets around government buildings and blockading entrances to the city. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said tens of thousands of people were milling around <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s Theater Square, where activists have held mass meetings. But it the situation was calmer than last week. The TV report said that as of Sunday, Armenian newspapers for the first time began publishing detailed information about what was happening in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. It said that would help lessen the strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that has organized the strikes and protests to support annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The television report said 207 of the 227 state-run enterprises in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> were working Monday. However, among the 20 not working were some of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s largest, it said. Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> visited a cable factory that was operating Monday, the reports said.

 Prosecutors described homosexual violence, necrophilia and mutilation Monday when opening statements began in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 young males. Prosecutor <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> computer programmer, as one who prowled the highways of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, picking up young male hitchhikers, plying them with Valium and beer, strangling, then sodomizing them and sometimes dumping their bodies from a moving car. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had a fetish for collecting mementos of victims and photographs,'' the prosecutor said, describing photos in which victims apparently were posed while dead. If <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, 43, is found guilty in the 16 killings, which would make him eligible for the death penalty, prosecutors plan to produce evidence at his sentencing that they say links him to 21 other slayings in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Prosecutors say the death total may be as high as 60. Opening statements in the trial, expected to last a year, began five years and four months after <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was arrested by a <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer who pulled him over for a routine traffic stop and discovered a dying Marine on the seat next to him. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> gave the jury gruesome details of the killings, which took place over 11 years. The victims were bound with shoelaces and strangled, often with their own belts, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. One victim was beheaded and at least one was sexually mutilated with a knife, the prosecutor said. Defense attorney <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> responded to the prosecutor's two-hour speech with 10 minutes of opening statements, warning jurors against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the killings. `` These are tactics designed to inflame you,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` This is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor. He wo n't be able to prove it. This case is based on suspicion, innuendo and prosecutorial rhetoric. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> killed no one,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. Defense attorneys lost two rounds in pretrial motions, when <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> denied a request to move the trial to another community and refused to bar some entries from a list prosecutors have called a `` scorecard'' of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s alleged victims. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of first-degree murder for slayings that occurred between December 1972 and May 1983. When he was arrested, police said, they found 47 color photographs of young men, many of them nude and apparently dead. They also found a notebook with more than 60 notations, which prosecutors have called a `` death list'' for all the murders allegedly committed by <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. Last week, <PERSON> McCartin </PERSON> allowed 13 entries on the list to be admitted as evidence. Prosecutors said the entries pertain to 14 killings in which <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> is charged.

<TEXT>
 The son-in-law of the late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> testified at his corruption trial Monday that he kept a $ 160,000 bribe because it would have been too awkward to return, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, the first deputy interior minister before <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982, took the witness stand for the first time at his trial before a military tribunal. The proceedings are in their fourth week. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, 51, is being tried with eight others in a case that is expected to last another month. He is charged with accepting hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes from officials in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, and could be sentenced to death by firing squad. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> testified that an <ORGANIZATION> Uzbekistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official named <PERSON> Umarov </PERSON> delivered a briefcase to his hotel room once, telling him it was a present from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>. `` When If opened it I found 100,000 or 130,000 rubles,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> as saying. `` I wanted to return the money, but to whom? <PERSON> Umarov </PERSON> left and I felt awkward approaching <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>.'' `` I was told that that was a a gift, and looked on it as a gift,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> as saying. At the official rate of exchange, 100,000 rubles is about $ 160,000. <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>, who died in 1983, was a close associate of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. Since <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>'s death, several key <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials have been charged with corruption that occurred during his rule and two have been executed. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, and worked in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s close associate, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty to abusing his office, but innocent to accepting bribes. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> also testified that <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials misled him into believing it was legal for him to use ministry resources to build a cellar for his country house. `` Naturally, when such explanations came from the former first deputy minister of internal affairs whose job it was to know the law, the audience could not help smiling,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s trial is the centerpiece of a campaign against the legacy of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, whose 18-year rule now is characterized in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a time of corruption and stagnation.

<HEAD>Ford Trust Agreement Breaks Down, Negotiations Continue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A last-minute settlement in a family feud over the $ 350 million trust left by auto magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> broke down in court Monday. The hearing before <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON> pitted <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s widow <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuRoss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> against the late automaker's son <PERSON> Edsel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> II and other family members, as well as trustee <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> had complained that <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, an ally of <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, was demanding a $ 1 million-a-year salary to administer the trust, and that he had threatened to cut her income to the minimum level of $ 1.5 million. Early Monday morning, 14 attorneys for both sides hammered out a compromise that was to remain secret. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, one of four attorneys representing Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, said only that under the settlement, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> would remain a trustee, a new lawyer would be appointed as the trust's attorney, and a financial advisor would be appointed. But a question over whether a legal guardian should be appointed for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s minor grandchildren created a furor, and the whole settlement collapsed. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who died last year, took control of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 from his frail and failing grandfather, auto pioneer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. He named Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> as sole beneficiary of his trust, but stipulated that upon her death, his six grandchildren would become the beneficiaries. He named three people to manage the trust _ Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edsel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and family friend <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Citrin </PERSON>. In April, <PERSON> Citrin </PERSON> killed himself. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s choice for an alternate trustee was <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, 57, an investment banker, former undersecretary of state and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and Management. Citing his expertise, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> requested a $ 1 million yearly salary for managing the trust. Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said his request amounted to extortion, and sued to have him removed. Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s income is more than $ 10 million a year, an attorney said. On Wednesday, a judge will hear a motion to dismiss the $ 5.4 million claim on the estate brought by <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> divorced in 1980 before he married <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuRoss </PERSON> later that year. The divorce settlement left her with $ 100,000 in quarterly payments for 20 years. She contends that since <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> died, the payments stopped, and has sued for the full 20-year amount.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> gave up Monday on trying to raise the $ 3.35 minimum this year, conceding they lacked the 60 votes needed to break a Republican-led filibuster. `` There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said `` I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful. I regret that. I would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s announcement meant there would be no vote on the bill this year. The bill by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., would have raised the wage floor, which has been stuck at its present level since 1981, to $ 3.75 in January, $ 4.15 in 1990 and $ 4.55 in 1991 While some 4.7 million Americans are now paid the minimum wage or less, the bill's supporters claimed it would have directly benefited 15 million workers now paid less than $ 4.55 an hour. `` I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` This bill could n't pass the House. It was n't going to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unless it was modified. The legislation had been the center of a partisan power struggle since it was introduced on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor on Sept. 15. Republicans immediately tried to amend it to include a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum wage that was demanded by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and advocated by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a condition for raising the basic floor. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> balked, using parliamentary tactics to effectively preclude the so-called training wage _ no training was required by companies that would pay the lower wage _ from ever getting a yea-or-nay vote. Republicans then immediately launched their filibuster. Democrats tried twice last week to break the filibuster but fell seven votes and then four votes short even though they had the support of eight Republicans on the last attempt Friday. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> called the training wage proposal `` a blatant attempt to turn back any consideration for an increase.'' He said it only would have encouraged employers to hire new workers at the subminimum and then fire them 90 days later to be replaced by a new group of workers that could be paid the lower amount. However, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the leader of the floor opposition to the bill, said a compromise increase could have been worked out if only Democrats had been willing to establish some form of broad subminimum. `` The real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> knows we were on the very edge of passing the training wage,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` The fact is that the international trade union movement in this country will not accept a training wage. They consider the minimum wage as their single idea.'' Republicans had filed a total of 158 amendments and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had answered each one with an amendment of his own to enable Democrats to retain control of the legislation. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> immediately tried to put the blame for the bill's demise on Vice President and Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president had said in the past three weeks that he could support a modest increase in the minimum wage _ never specifying how much _ but only if it was coupled with a subminimum floor. `` Perhaps the word from the vice president's campaign had not gotten through,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps it has gotten through. Either way the results are evident. Some 15 million workers are the loser.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which has endorsed Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also sought to put the blame on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Although Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed he favored an increase, he never specified the terms of his proposal and he never urged Republicans to end their filibuster,'' said the labor federation's president, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the most vigorous opponent of the increase, said the legislation's defeat reflects a growing understanding that mandated pay hikes and other benefits ultimately cause more harm than good. `` Hundreds of thousands of jobs were saved today by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fighting for pro-growth economic policies,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of employee relations policies for the chamber. `` Today's action will not only keep jobs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but will keep inflation in check and help our competitiveness economically.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backpedaled Monday from his debate suggestion that he might favor criminal penalties for women who undergo abortions. His campaign manager, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has thought the issue through and decided women are `` additional victims'' and should not be punished for undergoing abortions. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still believes in the possibility of `` punishment as far as the abortionist is concerned,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The head of a pro-choice group said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks had `` horrified'' many women. An anti-abortion leader called the issue `` a red herring'' and said no one envisions jailing women who get abortions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who favors a Constitutional ban on most abortions, was asked Sunday night if women and doctors who defied a ban on abortion should go to jail. `` I have n't sorted out the penalties,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course, there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself told reporters later Monday in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, there was `` no change'' in his stance. `` He horrified women last night,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he believes that abortion is murder, this business of saying women are the second victims is hypocritical.'' `` What he advocates is a policy of forced childbirth for every women who gets pregnant,'' she said. `` The result would be that women would be forced to seek back-alley, medically unsafe abortions as we did before 1973. Women would have to risk their lives and be butchered once again.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that neither his group nor others want to send women who seek abortions to jail. He called that `` a non-issue, a red herring.'' But `` we do think the doctors who profit from killing unborn children should be punished,'' including loss of their licenses, he added. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seized upon <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comment during their debate, saying, `` He's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he does not favor abortion, but believes `` it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision.'' As governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he has vetoed bills that sought to restrict funding of abortions for poor women. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in explaining his clarification of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position, said: `` After thinking about it overnight, we went in and discussed it this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed and we addressed it.'' `` Frankly, he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would be more properly considered an additional victim _ perhaps the second victim _ -LRB- and -RRB- that she would need help and love and not punishment,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has altered his stance on abortion four times. The nation needs a decisive president, `` not someone who will change his mind after an overnight meeting with his pollsters,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said. She said the Constitutional amendment to ban abortion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now favors _ after opposing it in 1980 before becoming <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s running mate _ `` would leave states free to impose criminal penalties on women who have abortions.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes abortions except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest. He supports government funding of abortions only to save the mother's life. He favors overturning the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that struck down state laws against abortion, and passage of a human life amendment to the Constitution to protect the unborn. Some 1.5 million abortions are performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annually, compared with 586,760 in 1972, when abortion was legal in only a few states. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> estimates that before abortions were legalized in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the 1960s, some 200,000 were performed illegally each year. To <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>'s argument that more women would be killed if abortions were outlawed again, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that would be `` a tragedy,'' but there would still be `` a tremendous savings in human life ... when one recognizes that at least one human being dies in every abortion.''

<HEAD>Movie Chief Calls for Arbitration Commission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A film industry leader said Monday a committee with binding arbitration power should be formed to resolve future labor disputes so <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> can avoid a rerun of the crippling 5 -LCB- - month writers' strike `` It's absolutely absurd and doubly shameful that it took five and a half months and involved thousands of innocent people to come up with a solution that reasonable men should have come up with sooner,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. Rich spoke at the opening session of Cinetex, a trade show and film festival for the film industry. The former board chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced this summer he was moving to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> to set up an independent production company. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> called on the industry's management and unions to establish a commission that would arbitrate future labor problems before they deteriorate into strikes. `` Call it HELP, or <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enhancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. `` This commission would be in place to forever ensure better handling of the labor-management situations than have ever existed before. `` This strike avoidance committee would act as the final arbiter in a dispute, when two sides agree to disagree,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. `` Its ruling would be binding, just like the baseball players and club owners who take salary disputes to arbitration.'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said that with an enforceable body in place, cooler and wiser heads might prevail. `` With the potential to have everything to win, but also with the potential to have everything to lose, perhaps management and labor will more efficiently and more expediently work toward what's fair. The movie chief, who helped build <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> into a TV programming powerhouse in the early 1980s, said his idea might not be perfect, but called it a place to start. `` The key is that we've got to do something about this problem,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. `` If not, the goose that laid the golden egg is going to be gone, chopped up _ and eaten.'' Under his proposal, studios would agree to bring in skilled labor relations experts _ either federal labor negotiators or labor lawyers. `` Just as a <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> MPAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and represents our interests, perhaps a labor statesman representing both the industry and the unions and guilds could serve as chairman of this committee,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> suggested. `` We'd bring together representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> AMPTP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- with representatives of all the guilds and unions to devise an anti-strike commission designed to be the arbiter of labor-management disputes.'' He called the strike an embarrassment to the industry and said it was `` time for management and the unions to put collective egos aside and make sure that there is n't a next time.'' A final arbiter in labor disputes could render verdicts `` long before any other bloodbaths occur,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The widow of <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> visited the president's unmarked grave Monday after returning from 15 years' forced exile, and tearfully thanked those who tended the site in her absence. <PERSON> Hortensia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussi </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> made the 75-mile trip from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the capital, to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal resort town of <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar with her two daughters, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, and a grandson, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, 74, spent a few minutes in silence before the gravestone, which carried only the name of a sister, <PERSON> Ines </PERSON>, and a brother-in-law. A recently-placed plaque bearing Allende's name had been removed. She brought a bouquet of red carnations and left them atop the tomb. About two dozen sympathizers, most of them working-class women, embraced Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> at the hillside cemetery. Many said they regularly tended to the gravesite. The widow, brushing back tears, told the women, `` I thank all of you for your faithfulness.'' `` Faithful to the death,'' several women answered. On a concrete walkway in front of the tomb, supporters had written in red paint: `` Allende Lives On In The People.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> Saturday, 24 days after right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> announced an end to all official exile. The measure affected 504 leftists, including Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> and her children. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died on Sept. 11, 1973, during a coup led by Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> that toppled the elected leftist government. According to the military, <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> shot himself with a machine gun at the presidential palace, which was rocketed by air force fighter jets. The version is widely accepted by historians and even many <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> critics. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist, had said he would never surrender or allow himself to be captured. A day later, he was buried in <PERSON> Vina </PERSON> del Mar. Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> was flown by the military to attend the ceremony. She and her children then sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and left the country. Mrs. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> was not active in her husband's government but after his death became a symbol of political repression by the new military government. She became an outspoken critic of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, and upon her return said she would support efforts to defeat him in an Oct. 5 presidential plebiscite. If a majority votes yes in the ballot, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain in power until 1997. If most vote no, an open election will be held next year and he must hand power over to the winner in 1990.

<TEXT>
 Both political camps waved victory flags Monday in the wake of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> matchup, but polls indicated the debate was a draw in the opinion of many voters. Several analysts said a tie actually worked in favor of one runner in this race: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Their reasoning was that since the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was less experienced and less well known on the national stage than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he gained credibility simply by holding his own against the vice president. A few polling organizations hit the telephones as soon as the debate stage went black, seeking voters' opinions uncolored by the analysis of campaign officials or others. The Gallup Organization surveyed 337 voters after the debate for <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and found 42 percent thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came out on top, while 41 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the winner. Twelve percent called it a tie and 5 percent had no opinion. The poll had a 6 point margin of error. ABC News canvassed 639 voters immediately after the debate and found 44 percent felt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the encounter, 36 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 20 percent called it a tie. In a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll of 415 debate watchers, 42 percent thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won and 39 percent thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won, within the margin of error of plus or minues five points. And in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey, 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won, 34 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and 29 percent called it even. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` Overall, it was a net plus for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in that it leveled the playing field forboth of them.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Close means good for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because he started out four to six points behind in most of the polls.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> effectively demolished the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> image of him as some sort of dangerous, radical left-winger,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been painting him in very extreme colors for the last month. ... Just by appearing safe and steady and reasonable, I thought he scored a big point.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> handlers began trumpeting victory the moment the debate ended, and their supporters were for the most part true blue, too. An exception was Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a Republican, who said, `` Neither guy won and neither guy lost.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, editor-at-large of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report and former <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director, predicted `` this will make it a more competitive race.'' <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` made good, telling points on traditional values and the differences between the two candidates,'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` showed an understanding of the middle class and those left behind on health insurance, housing, age and the like.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> panel of six forensic experts gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a narrow victory on their scorecards, 144-141, although three judges picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and three called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the winner. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> judges' panel, said neither candidate delivered a knockout punch The <ORGANIZATION> AEI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said the debates loom especially large in this election year because there is no single issue that has galvanized the voters' attention. He predicted, `` Both candidates are going to be looking for a knockout blow at the next debate.'' That will be held Oct. 13 or 14 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Their running mates, Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, get their turn in the debating ring Oct. 5 in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> got scattered rain Monday, but most of the nation enjoyed pleasant weather thanks to a high-pressure pattern over the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and southern Plains. Warm and humid air just south of a stationary front across northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> triggered scattered thunderstorms in the area in the early afternoon.

 The army said Monday that clashes last week between leftist guerrillas and troops of the U.S.-backed government killed 60 people and wounded 100. It said that in a one-week span ending Saturday, 30 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and 23 soldiers were killed in the fighting and 36 guerrillas and 54 soldiers were wounded. A communique from the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said two other people were killed by land mines planted by the rebels and accused the guerrillas of `` assassinating six peasants.'' In addition, rebels wounded two peasants, kidnapped two people and injured eight more in mine attacks, the statement said. The communique said rebels destroyed two offices of the state-owned telecommunications company, a city hall, six vehicles and 12 electrical system structures during the period. No rebel report for the same period was available Monday. A rebel attack Monday destroyed another telecommunications office in <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>, four miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but no casualties were reported, military sources said. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrillas fired on a military helicopter on Sunday in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, 54 miles north of the capital, wounding the pilot. About 65,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the nearly 9-year-old war between the guerrillas and the government.

<TEXT>
 Three test projects using plastic magnetic strip cards instead of food stamps will be conducted in parts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bode </PERSON> said that nearly 30,000 food stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see if the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce lost or stolen coupons. The projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12 months and run for at least three years, he said. An evaluation will be made to see if the electronic system might be used nationally. Bode said the $ 1.3 million project will operate by running the plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout counters. The cost of the food will be automatically deducted from the family's todal monthly food stamp allotment. In addition, he said, some of the food stamp recipients will be able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits, such as Aid for Families With Dependent Children. The department first tested the use of electronic benefits in Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in 1984, involving 3,400 households. It received high scores from food stamp recipients, stores and banks, which are involved in issuing and redeeming food stamps coupons. Bode said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> will get funding to design its projects, which will be tested in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, with services to 6,500 households. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> will test its system in <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> among 13,000 households, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will conduct its test in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> among 10,150 households. Nationally, nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp benefits, based on family size and adjusted household incomes. The program costs about $ 12.6 billion a year.

 Congressional and administration officials were close to agreement Monday on a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget which eliminates some of the objections raised by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he vetoed a defense spending measure last month, congressional sources said. The agreement was being worked out in a series of closed-door meetings involving <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and top Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Under terms of the proposed agreement <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s cherished Star Wars anti-missile program would receive $ 4.1 billion, a figure far under his $ 4.8 billion he requested for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the sources said. The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the program is formally known, currently receives $ 3.9 billion. But the compromise would drop some restrictions in the SDI budget to which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had objected in the bill he vetoed Aug. 3, the sources said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted $ 330 million for SDI work which could be used for an early-stage deployment system, but the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had restricted spending on that program to only $ 85 million. The compromise also drops a restriction which had been added by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on testing of depressed-trajectory missiles, a type of atomic-tipped weapon being developed by the Pentagon. Overall, the bill would provide about $ 300 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the same as the earlier bill, but slightly less than the current $ 302 billion. Agreement on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget would dramatically enhance the prospects that all 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the government would be enacted by Saturday, the first day of the 1989 federal fiscal year. The last time work on all 13 spending bills was completed by the start of the new fiscal year was in 1948. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders have been pressing to complete work on all appropriations bills to avoid <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> painting the Democrats as inefficient and incapable of adhering to the budget process. Last December the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent the president a 1,400-page, $ 600 billion catch-all spending bill that arrived at the White House nearly three months into the new fiscal year. During his State of the Union address in January, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> threatened to veto any similar giant spending bills this year, and scores of lawmakers signed letters pledging to support him. This year's appropriations work was made easier by the budget summit agreement reached between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders in November. That pact settled many broad spending questions for 1989, but disputes over various provisions within several individual bills have caused delays. Lawmakers have said that the dispute over the defense bill was the most serious, and that its resolution would make it likely that all 13 bills would be finished on time. So far, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed four appropriations bills into law, and has been sent two others.

 A panel of business and academic executives said Monday that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is wasting its human capital, and the next president must make improved education and training a top national priority. `` Inattention to our human resource needs and the waste of human potential are eroding our national strength,'' the Business-Higher Education Forum warned. The panel, chaired by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, said the nation must forge a new consensus on how to improve its schools and the capacity of its workers. `` Too much of our human talent is being wasted, and a growing proportion of the next generation is slipping beyond the reach of the institutions and values of our society,'' it said in a report called `` American Potential: The Human Dimension.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a leader of a task force that produced the report, told a news conference, `` The task must be faced and the price must be paid. We are out of alternatives. From the cradle on, Americans must have the best in education and training, and we must provide it.'' The forum, comprised of 80 corporate and university executives, urged the next president to appoint Cabinet-level task forces or convene a White House Conference on Human Resources to address these problems. It said math and science education must be bolstered, especially for the disadvantaged, and it urged every state to follow the example of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and others that have created highly selective public high schools for math and science. It also called for expanded preschool opportunities, including day care, health screening and nutrition services.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, amid efforts to clarify who would be liable for punishment if abortions were outlawed, campaigned in a Democratic region Monday with running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and was cheered loudly when he asked: `` One debate down. How'd I do?'' And the vice president gave what seemed a surprising answer to that question when talking later to reporters. `` I thought it was kind of about even,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Several thousand people turned out at a railroad amusement park in this west <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> community to applaud <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his debate Sunday night with Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had his supporters, as well. A plane flew over the park trailing a streamer that read: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 0.'' Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the debate site, campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the vice president, after reflecting overnight, decided he would not favor criminal prosecution of women who have abortions even if abortions are outlawed. In the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had not `` sorted out the penalties'' that might be imposed under an anti-abortion constitutional amendment he favors but that `` there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately seized on the answer, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making that decision. It's as simple as that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of the potential controversy until asked about it by reporters at <LOCATION> Casey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. `` No change of mine at all,'' he insisted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was his first since they were together on Aug. 21. From <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned separately at a barbecue near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for an overnight stay. At the event near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about a news report that president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had claimed in a conversation with Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., that the debate was a near draw `` He's probably right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides have claimed the vice president scored a clear victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not made such a claim during his day of camapign appearances in the South. Addressing a crowd of hundreds, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` You know you get up there in these debates, why sometimes things escape you. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> -LRB- his wife -RRB-, I think, was a nervous wreck, and our daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, standing next to her, I think they were biting their fingernails off,'' he joked. `` But we think it turned out pretty well.'' `` I am particularly proud to be standing at the side of my running mate in whom I have not only confidence but pride,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the flag-waving audience in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` One debate down. How'd I do?'' he asked. When he got the response he wanted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` All right. Stay tuned'' _ referring to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate Oct. 5 with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I loved it last night, I loved it'' when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised the problem of housing for Americans. He said interest rates were 21 percent under the last Democratic administration and `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does not want that anymore.'' Using a football metaphor, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that when Republicans took over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economy `` was in punt formation, deep in our own end zone. `` And now we're marching down the field, heading toward the goal line, and the old <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> team, that second string, that punt-on-first down crowd, wants to get back into the game,'' he said. `` No thank you. No thanks. Let's hold the ball. Let's keep moving forward. Let's take it into the score.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate answer on abortion _ one of the most explosive and divisive issues in politics _ gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an easy target to exploit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff moved quickly to remove it. `` We went in and discussed it -LRB- with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed and we addressed it,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal, notwithstanding his view in favor of right of life.'' `` Frankly, he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would be more properly considered an additional victim _ perhaps the second victim _ that she would need help and love and not punishment,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said that `` some consideration could be given ... to punishment as far as the abortionist is concerned.'' At an early-morning briefing with reporters, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was able to project himself as `` warm, as human and as likeable'' while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to `` come across as likeable, and less dour and less technocratic.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> softened <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate proposal to `` permit people to buy into Medicaid'' in order for the very poor to have medical coverage. `` All I know is he thinks that would be an appropriate approach to explore,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

 One of 10 men accused in the alleged gang rape of a woman testified Monday he was having an affair with her and that she insisted on having sex with him outside a shed where an illegal cockfight was taking place. `` She had been drinking,'' said <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 24, who testified that he and the woman had been seeing each other for about two months. His testimony before more than 160 people in the jammed courtroom conflicted with the woman's allegations. The woman told police she was abducted and raped the night of March 26-27 by as many as 23 men at a ranch where the cockfight was taking place and in two other locations near this southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> is the first of the 10 men charged in the case to come to trial, before State District Judge <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> testified he first saw the woman that night as he was driving down a street near her home. She flagged down his pickup truck, got in and they drove somewhere and had sex, he said. The woman told him she wanted to see him later that night, but he declined because he was going to the cockfight, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. Then, as he and three friends were were driving to the ranch for the fight, they passed the woman, who insisted on getting in, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. The woman testified earlier she declined to get in the car and that `` they grabbed me and pushed me in the car.'' When they got to ranch, <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said his three companions got out of the car, but the woman insisted <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> stay. `` I wanted to go over there -LRB- to the shed -RRB- to see the roosters, but she would n't let me,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` She started kissing me and we started making love in the car.'' Afterward, he said he went to the cockfight while she stayed in the car. He returned later and told her he was going to take her home because `` she was all crazy,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. But she got out and followed him to the front of the car, he said. `` Then she started kissing me again and we started making love on the hood of the car,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said the woman refused to get off the car when the other men started coming out of the shed. He said she finally jumped onto the hood of another car and he and the three other men left and he went home. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said when he left she was not having sex with anybody. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, on cross examination, pointed out that others had testified <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> was present when various men were having sex with the woman, and that <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and another man assaulted her simultaneously. `` And all these people are lying, right?'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> answered, `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> also denied holding her wrists and having oral or anal sex with the woman, as other witnesses have testified. Earlier Monday, a justice of the peace testified the woman was dazed and crying when he interviewed her the morning after the alleged attack. `` She was quiet and, you know, she would be facing down most of the time, facing the floor,'' said Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Amado </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The justice of the peace said the woman, 19, and her husband, 23, filed complaints the morning of March 27. The couple cried during their interview, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> testified. `` Sometimes she told me they were all over her and sometimes she did n't see who it was,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> testified. All 10 men charged with sexual assault are being tried individually while those charged with kidnapping will be tried in groups, officials have said. All 10 men have pleaded innocent. A 14-year-old boy also faces charges in the case.

 Three federal appeals court judges sharply questioned a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> lawyer Monday about why city officials had not taken necessary steps to reduce overcrowding at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> Reformatory. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON> noted that a lower court had found `` an intransigence on the part of prison officials'' in complying with a 1982 consent decree to limit the population of <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>'s central facility to 1,125. `` There has n't been a good-faith effort to comply with the consent decree,'' said <PERSON> Rosenn </PERSON>, a federal appeals judge from <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who was sitting on the case by special assignment. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> said <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> prison officials were guilty of abuse of judicial power in choosing to pay fines imposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge June Green for violating the consent decree rather than eliminate overcrowding. The $ 250-per-day fines for each of the <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION> facility's 26 dormitories has been `` treated as another operating expense'' by prison officials, <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> said. Those fines now total $ 1.5 million, according to a lawyer for the inmates. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON>, a city lawyer, argued that prison authorities could n't foresee the `` massive increase in the prison population'' resulting from increased drug prosecutions and convictions over the last five years. `` How is that a changed circumstance?'' <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> said, noting that city officials knew the physical capacity of the central facility when they agreed to the consent decree to settle the lawsuit by prisoners complaining of overcrowded and filthy conditions at the prison in <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` There is no basis for anyone to find that the increase in the drug conviction rate was unforseeable,'' <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> said. The city is appealing <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s order directing it to comply with the consent decree by lowering the population of the central facility, which has fluctuated between 1,400 and 1,500 inmates in the last two years. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, who represents the inmates, called the district's request that the judge modify the consent order `` a calculated attempt to postpone the court's order to enforce the decree. Both <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> and Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> questioned the city's threat to refuse to take new inmates convicted of felonies if it were forced to comply with the consent decree <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> wanted to know the number of inmates serving sentences for misdemeanors who could be released to make room for newly convicted felons. <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> could n't produce a figure, drawing further rebuke from the court. `` The representation to the court that the system will have to be closed _ that is like saying there is nobody in the system who is less dangerous than someone who is about to be convicted,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said. `` That's not really credible.'' <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> also chastised <PERSON> Schwab </PERSON> for depicting a prison department `` at war with'' the mayor and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over corrections policy. `` If you've got problems with the mayor and the City Council you have my deepest sympathy, but these are n't legitimate reasons to modify the consent decree,'' <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> said.

 Twenty-four members of the political opposition ended a hunger strike Monday but vowed to continue their non-violent campaign against the leftist Sandinista government. The hunger strike by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION> began Friday after the government barred a planned Sunday demonstration. Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said the march had been called to provoke the authorities. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON>, vice president of the coordinate, a center-right coalition of 16 labor groups and political parties, called the hunger strike the first in a series of peaceful anti-government actions. He told a news conference that other actions could include longer fasts or work stoppages. The strikers said they also were demanding the release of 38 Nicaraguans jailed July 10 after an anti-government demonstration in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>. The government says the detainees will be tried. `` There is no judicial liberty in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>!'' yelled <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Andara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubeda </PERSON>, a coordinate member. He said the detained political leaders were being kept in `` inhuman'' conditions at a prison in <LOCATION> Granada </LOCATION> but `` their hearts are filled with patriotism that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will return to being a republic.'' Opposition leaders also lashed out at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> backed opposition groups in an internal destabilization plan. <PERSON> Gurdian </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` jeopardized the Nandaime prisoners.'' `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s -RRB- comments put into danger the lives of the opposition and gives the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> more reason for deeper repression,'' said <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments supported what they had been saying all along. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded organization, provided more than $ 600,000 for civic opposition groups in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Those who received the funds have been identified as the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, two anti-government labor unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said his group does not receive any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding. Members of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s fragmented opposition note they have remained in their country to fight against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> rather than leave, take up arms and join the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and other Sandinista leaders recently have referred to the opposition groups as `` unarmed Contras.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also said he signed an agreement with <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to join forces in the political opposition. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, whose nome de guerre was Commander Zero, is a former Sandinista guerrilla who switched sides after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power and led the Contras in the southern front near <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, who left the Contras in 1986, has talked about returning from exile in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> seeks a broad-based center-left opposition to fight the Sandinistas politically. `` It ca n't be with the right or the extreme left, not with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and not with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It's an option away from extremes,'' he said. The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

 Members of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s new centrist party, the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, voted overwhelmingly Monday to call themselves the Democrats for short. The vote by a show of hands at the party's first annual conference in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort upset some members of the old <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who wanted the short title <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, to include their former party's historic name. The Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was formed last March from a merger of the long-established <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and most of the 7-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, the Social Democratic leader, refused to join and is a leading a separate faction. Legislator Sir <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, said excluding <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> from the short title was `` extraordinary folly.'' `` For me, the world Democrat simply has no clear political meaning,'' he said. He said the new short title implied that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two major parties, the governing Conservatives and opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, `` are not democrats.'' `` They are,'' added <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. The new parties obtained 20 percent of the vote in an electoral alliance at the last general election in 1987. But the acrimonious merger slashed support. A Harris poll published Sunday in the liberal Observer newspaper showed the Democrats with eight percent support and <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s faction with five percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dates to the 1840s and was one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two major parties until Labor supplanted it in the 1920s

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exchanged post-debate jabs from a distance Monday, the Democrat saying his rival would `` lead <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> nowhere'' and the vice president charging his opponent with trying to obscure a liberal past. The two candidates renewed campaign hostilities as their aides waited for the impact of Sunday night's nationally televised debate to show up in the close race for the White House. The first polls rated the 90-minute confrontation a tossup, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said he thought the debate went `` kind of about even.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved to exploit the debate to his advantage as aides rushed two new television commercials into production containing snippets of his performance. One shows the Democrat delivering a portion of his closing debate statement, saying: `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not behind us. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at a campaign rally in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and said, `` One debate down.

But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said later at a barbecue near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, `` I thought it was kind of about even.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been asked about a news report that president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had claimed in a conversation with Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., that the debate was a near draw `` He's probably right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides have claimed the vice president scored a clear victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not made such a claim during a day of camapign appearances in the South. `` After last night, for most people the notion of President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a very, very troubling notion today,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. That was an attempt to reverse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' debate-night declaration that the prospect of a President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a troubling idea for many people. Despite the outward display of confidence, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides sought to deflect any repercussions from the vice president's debate comment that he had n't decided whether women who obtain abortions should face legal penalties Campaign manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters that after giving it more thought overnight, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was opposed to the idea. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he had `` no change'' on the subject, although during the debate he said he had n't `` sorted out'' the subject of possible penalties. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first appearance of the day was in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, where he said the debate provided `` the best moments of this whole campaign.'' In remarks intended to rebut <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges of liberalism, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said: `` We heard a lot of talk last night from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the mainstream. But it's clear that he's willing to leave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families high and dry. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said, `` offers the easy way. He sees no challenges, he offers no solutions, and he will lead American nowhere as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Addressing a crowd of 3,000, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to explain how he'd bring down those massive federal deficits without raiding the Social Security trust fund. `` And what did he say? Not one word,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Just as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s managers sought to minimize damage of the abortion issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides tried to deflect controversy about the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, a civil-rights organization that counts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among its members. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for joining the group, and said during the debate that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> favors relaxing child pornography laws, wants to eliminate the current system for movie ratings and opposes the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s tax exemption. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the governor disagreed with the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s position on each of the issues cited by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` Last night he suggested that I agreed with every position ever taken by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, and that is nonsense and I know it,'' he said in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, `` Two months ago, I signed one of the toughest child pornography laws in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I've always supported tax exemptions for religious institutions. And I certainly do n't support <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is defending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his Democratic rival clashed sharply on a variety of domestic and foreign issues Sunday, and public opinion polls said the debate was roughly a draw. That type of outcome traditionally favors the out-of-power candidate, and one analyst said that was exactly what happened. `` In essence, the debate served to restart the campaign.'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Overall, it was a net plus for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in that it leveled the playing field for both of them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> said a poll taken immediately after the debate found that 42 percent of the voters who watched on television said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did a better job while 41 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outperformed his rival. The margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> poll taken Sunday night found that 44 percent rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the winner, 36 percent gave the edge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 20 percent said it was a tie. Those participating in the survey said in advance of the debate that they supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by a margin of 48 percent to 46 percent, with 6 percent undecided, said network polling analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. In the survey taken immediately after the debate, 52 percent said they supported <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 45 percent supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 3 percent were undecided. Given the 4.5-point margin or error, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, the shift in sentiment was statistically meaningless. In a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll of 415 debate watchers, 42 percent thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won and 39 percent thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won, within the margin of error of plus or minues five points. And in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey, 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won, 34 percent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and 29 percent called it even.

 Investigations began Monday at a police academy into whether strenuous exercise contributed to the hospitalization of 16 cadets for exhaustion and dehydration, including one who needs a liver transplant. Several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed Monday without clearance from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. He was taking part in the internal investigation and unavailable. But one former trainee said the training routine was severe. `` I've been through basic training in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and it was twice as bad as that,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, who quit the academy after one day. `` The doctors told me that if I had gone back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney damage.'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, a <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> police trainee who collapsed while running on the track Sept. 19, the first day of classes, was flown to <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and on Monday for a liver transplant. The operation, which began Monday evening, was expected to take up to 12 hours, said <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON>, who kept in contact with the <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> family in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> hospital spokesman said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> also suffered kidney problems, and that several of the other hospitalized cadets underwent kidney dialysis treatment. Six remained hospitalized Monday. After <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed, instructors allowed the recruits to drink two small cups of water, <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said. `` Before that, they had lined us up at the bubbler twice during the day and only let us take one cup of water each,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, chief state epidemiologist, said his examination last week found `` it's very clear the exercise was stressful,'' although he said further investigation may show other contributing causes. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state executive office of public safety, said investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the academy, and state police, whose troopers are instructors at the academy, interviewed the class of 47 men and women Monday. They planned to present findings Tuesday. Several local officials, including <LOCATION> Wojkowski </LOCATION> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, asked the state attorney general's office to review the training program. <PERSON> Wojkowski </PERSON> met Monday with <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> and state police Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, and said afterward, `` I was completely dissatisfied with their responses. I suspect that the incidents are not isolated.'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, was the only cadet hospitalized the first day of classes, but two more were hospitalized the next day and an additional two the third day of classes, authorities said. Academy officials urged cadets Wednesday night to seek medical examinations, and 21 exhibited some of the symptoms ranging from fatigue and nausea to kidney failure. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> was in `` tip-top'' shape and had `` worked out for over six months at least, running and everything,'' to prepare for the academy, said his brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` He really wanted to be a policeman,'' the brother said. `` He'd been trying to be one for a couple of years. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s condition may have resulted in part from a `` self-induced, severe diet.'' But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said his brother spent the days before reporting to the academy with his family and ate normally. `` He definitely was not fasting. That's total lies. He definitely was eating fine,'' the brother said. <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> said recruits were required to exercise vigorously and were kept moving with pushups and laps if they failed to respond quickly to orders. `` We started at 7:30 a.m. with a formation with our gear _ our jackets, boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60 pounds _ and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag above our heads with one arm,'' he said. `` We also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the basement up to either the second or third floor of the building,'' he said. `` Everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to the physical training part.'' In February 1987 a young <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> officer shot herself in the head after the first week of the 13-week course.

<TEXT>
 Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> is broke and will have to leave the luxurious suite he has occupied since fleeing here after a coup in neighboring <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> unseated him Sept. 17, an official said Monday. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabral </PERSON> said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was forced to leave <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> so quickly _ only hours after the coup carried out by the Presidential Guard _ that he did not have time to bring money. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s bills at the Dominican Concorde Hotel will be paid by the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> government but he will have to leave the hotel by week's end, the official said. In a televised interview, <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> has received some economic aid from a group of Haitian businessmen residing in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> friends. The deposed general is accompanied in exile by his wife, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had made an official petition for permanent political asylum in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, as was reported by a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source last week. However, he admitted that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> has made it obvious he wants to stay in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which shares the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of Hispaniola with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s presence in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> will not affect relations with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> -RRB- says that he was never a politician, that he was a military man, that his military career is over now and that he is not interested in any political or military position,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said, speaking about discussions he had with the former Haitian leader. `` It seems that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> never thought he would have to leave his country and ... because of the circumstances under which he had to do it he was unable to bring any money,'' <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. The deputy foreign minister said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s friends are searching for a modest but secure house for the deposed general and his family to move into by the end of this week. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> also denied rumors that <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, the ousted mayor of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, left the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in the Haitian capital. He said <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, his wife, daughter and a group of about 10 other persons are still in the embassy waiting for the Haitian government to grant them safe conduct out of the country. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> is the reputed leader of thugs known as <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION> and is suspected of having ordered the attack at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that left 13 persons dead and 77 wounded. The Sept. 11 massacre was mentioned by the soldiers who overthrew <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> as one of the reasons for carrying out the coup. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> remains secluded in his hotel suite, refusing to speak with reporters. A waiter who is the only person authorized by security personnel to attend to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s needs in the hotel said <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> spends the day in white short pants, either reading or looking out the window of his suite. His wife and daughter also spend most of the time reading, said the waiter, who asked that his name not be used.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday the vice president was wrong in suggesting in the previous night's debate that he agreed with controversial positions of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> `` That's nonsense and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> issue at an evening rally in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after ignoring the issue earlier in the day even as aides moved to distance him from positions taken by the civil liberties organization which he holds a membership in. In the debate Sunday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' membership in the group and noted positions taken by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, including opposition to restrictions on child pornography, opposition to movie ratings and opposition to the tax exemption for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` Last night he suggested that I agreed with every position ever taken by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, and that is nonsense and he knows it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Two months ago, I signed one of the toughest child pornography laws in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I've always suggested tax exemptions for religious institutions. And I certainly do n't support <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is defending. But <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had misstated the organization's positions. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides earlier had noted that the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> had filed lawsuits against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> over his plans to use roadblocks to catch drunken drivers and a policy that effectively bars homosexuals from becoming foster parents. Earlier in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not raise the issue, although <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has to respond'' on the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his first campaign stop in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a reliable Democratic stronghold in a major industrial state, after his first nationally televised confrontation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on Sunday. Before an estimated crowd of 3,000 people in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s Public Square, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> belittled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate answers on questions such as Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and the federal deficit. `` I asked <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to explain how he'd bring down those massive federal deficits without raiding the Social Security trust fund,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And what did he say? Not one word.'' On each issue, he asked what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s answer had been and elicited the crowd's response: `` Not one word.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offers the easy way,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He sees no challenges. He offers no solutions. And he will lead <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> nowhere as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled former President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s crucial debate with GOP Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1960, and said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also had chosen <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> for his first post-debate appearance. `` And all of you know what happened,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> won the debate and the election that year, although he lost <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Last night, we got down to the real issues in this campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We heard a lot of talk last night from Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the mainstream. But it's clear from what we heard last night that he's willing to leave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families high and dry.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' week-long campaign swing will take him to several of the biggest states he is seeking to win. By week's end, he also will have visited <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said overnight polls showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was judged as decisive winner of the debate, although she disclosed no details. She said campaign surveys showed `` a very strong increase in the governor's favorabilities,'' or people responding favorably to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides released a list of 16 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> statements during the debate that they contended were errors or distortions. They noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debate statement that he wants `` to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons,'' but said he cast three tie-breaking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes as vice president to renew production of chemical weapons after a 17-year moratorium. The aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the Surgeon General's effort to educate the public about AIDS, but that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposed sending AIDS educational materials to households until forced by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators met separately with Angolan-Cuban and South African delegations Monday as a new round of Angolan peace talks opened. The Americans were clearly hopeful of an accord. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, sat down with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s delegation to sound it on an Angolan proposal for the withdrawal of Cuban troops within three years, conference sources said. Later Monday, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Cuban-Angola </LOCATION> delegation to give them South African proposals on the withdrawal, according to the sources, who spoke on condition their names not be used. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday, said that `` years of patient diplomacy and support for those in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> who seek self-determination are having their effect.'' `` We look forward to an accord between the governments of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troops _ primarily <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> _ from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has insisted the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> be withdrawn within a year. The Cubans are backing <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, which is fighting a 13-year-old bush war against guerrillas backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was optimistic about the talks, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government-controlled radio expressed reservations `` It is now imperative that ... the Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> governments stop stalling on the agreement to withdraw the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military contingent from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and set a realistic timetable for a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal,'' the radio said. The leader of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director-general of foreign affairs, claimed Cubans had moved beyond a cease-fire line to attack the rebels, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has denied the Cubans are involved in the attack. South African troops already have pulled out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as part of the Aug. 10 cease-fire. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has said it will take four years to send the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> home. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has insisted they pull out before it grants independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to the south. Independence is to be granted within the next year. Some African nations have joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in trying to persuade <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to begin talks with the rebels, but it has refused any official contact. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was represented at the talks Monday by Lt.

 Army boats and helicopters took thousands of marooned people to safety in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state Monday after four days of incessant rain flooded northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and killed hundreds of people, authorities said. At least 70 people died in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and floodwaters in the neighboring states of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Himachal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> killed nearly 200 others, officials said. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state said at least 34 people were washed away in swirling floodwaters there since Sunday. The toll was expected to rise because communications were cut off with many villages after rivers overflowed their embankments. Relief officials said at least 200,000 people were stranded in 78 villages across <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, which produces more than half of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s wheat and rice <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said many of those crops were destroyed. Officials said 35 power stations in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> were ordered shut because of the danger of electrocution, plunging flood-hit areas of <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kapurthala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hoshiarpur </LOCATION> into darkness. Disrupted road and rail links and continued rains hampered relief efforts. The <LOCATION> Yamuna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was flowing `` well above danger levels'' in the federal capital of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, according to officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and villagers living along the river bank were being evacuating to higher ground. A government spokesman told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Monday said no threat to the city itself existed, although water levels were rising. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> appointed a crisis management group of government officials to handle the flood emergency, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The hardest-hit <LOCATION> Pujabi </LOCATION> city was <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION>, where an estimated 50,000 Indians were isolated. `` Our first priority is to evacuate the marooned and to give them food and shelter,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> told reporters. He said 100 boats were pressed into service and another 100 were requested from the army and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Helicopters dropped food into stricken areas, but were hampered by rain. Many roads were covered with up to eight feet of water, officials said. Landslides set off by the rains cut off access to other roads. Rail service among the cities of <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> was suspended due to rising rivers. Floods caused by summer monsoons are a frequent problem in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Last month, monsoon-swollen rivers flooded three-fourths of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The government said at least 1,000 people died. Newspapers put the toll at more than 2,000.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Rank-and-file soldiers who helped oust Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and more than 50 of his military commanders promised Monday to protect the rights of the poor. `` We are not only defending the enlisted men, we are speaking for all the poor people,'' an unidentified soldier was quoted as telling <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> at army general headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. `` People have the right to demonstrate, to express what's in their hearts, as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said, adding that soldiers would guarantee the safety of demonstrators. Another soldier said the 50 or more superior officers who have been ousted by their troops since the Sept. 17 uprising against <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> will not be allowed to return to the army. `` We wo n't allow it,'' he said, adding that soldiers are still demanding the ouster of more officers because of their unpopularity or ties to the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship. The soldiers were not identified by the radio station. Members of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s Presidential Guard, led by 27-year-old Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, said they ousted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> because they were `` sickened'' by his alleged collusion with thugs of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime who massacred 13 parishioners and wounded more than 77 others people during a Mass on Sept. 11. The soldiers appointed Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as the new president. Also Monday, soldiers ordered the dismissal of the director of the general post office, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Malette </PERSON>, after employees went on strike demanding his ouster. Malette was replaced by <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON>, a managerial level employee. Employees of state agencies, following the example of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,000 soldiers, have ousted the unpopular directors of the state flour mill, telephone company and water authority <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the new state prosecutor, was sworn in Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, replacing Namphy-appointee <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pluviose </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the private army under the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime, killed three peasants who were protesting their presence in <LOCATION> Verrette </LOCATION>, a village 60 miles north of the capital. The alleged Tonton Macoutes were accompanied by local police Chief <PERSON> Dumarsais </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the radio stations reported. The regime begun by dictator <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> in 1957 ended when his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, fled into exile in February 1986. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> took over as head of a three-man junta until <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> was elected president last January in balloting widely thought to be fraudulent. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a coup last June.

<TEXT>
 The brother-in law of Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> denied he is homosexual and is suffering from AIDS, despite an emotional public description of his alleged ailment by the conservative congressman's wife. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, 51, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> landscape architect, angrily denounced comments made Sept. 18 by his sister, <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> told a Garden Grove town hall meeting she lost her temper and called a gay demonstrator a `` fag'' because she was distraught over her homosexual brother's battle against AIDS, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> denied he is homosexual, saying he is healthy and has seen his sister only once since their mother's funeral in 1983. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who threatened to file a defamation lawsuit against the <PERSON> Dornans </PERSON>, said he came forward for two reasons: `` To defend my good name and to blast that guy -LRB- <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> -RRB- out of the water, too. He's a turkey.'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> and his wife both declined to comment, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>'s chief of staff. `` It has no bearing on his responsibility as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` It's a matter between his wife and her brother.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said that because he had many gay friends and feared even casual contact with them might expose him to the disease, he had been tested for the AIDS virus four or five times in the last two years. All the tests were negative, he added. `` Why does she come off the wall and say something like this,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't believe it. She's been in politics for years, and she's got to do this to me? I ca n't believe it.'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, a Republican running for a third term, has been criticized by gay activists for his stand against anti-discrimination legislation and his opposition to having any gay caucus within the GOP. The congressman's daughter, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, said her parents would not respond to inquiries about <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. Responding to questions about how the <PERSON> Dornans </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s alleged illness, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said: `` That's personal. There's been communication. That's all I'm going to say. `` It's something that's very, very sensitive and very personal and very sad. We just want to communicate with him and we do n't want him to be sick and alone. Mrs. <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> described her brother's condition to the crowd of 200 at the forum. `` He tells me every day; the thinner he gets, the sores covering his body,'' she said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said her mother was speaking in the future tense about what she feared would happen to her brother in the advanced stages of the fatal illness. The Times reported that <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> appeared robust and healthy during the interview. `` I'll take an AIDS test anytime,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` I'm a healthy 51.'' He held out his arms and referring to the purple lesions that are symptoms of a skin cancer common among AIDS patients, he asked, `` Do you see any spots?'' As for his weight, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> grinned and said, `` I'm getting a little porky.''

 A Mexican drug trafficker on Monday became the second of a trio of defendants to be found guilty in torture and slaying of a <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> undercover drug agent in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, described by prosecutors as the chief lieutenant of reputed Mexican drug czar <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, was convicted on five counts of conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and two counts of violent acts in support of racketeering. The two acts were the murders of Drug Enforcement Administration Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury, which had earlier convicted a co-defendant in the case, returned its verdict on <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION>, 36, in its fourth day of deliberations. However, the panel did n't immediately decide on the charges against a third defendant, and planned to resume deliberation on Tuesday <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, an admitted drug trafficker, and his attorneys sighed in disappointment when Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> read the first guilty verdict. The lawyers had argued that <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was a scapegoat used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican governments to close an embarrassing and internationally sensitive case. Defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON>, who had argued passionately for <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>'s acquittal, told reporters: `` It's a black day in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice. `` They brought in trumped-up evidence in the case, lied to the jury and got away with it. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> is innocent. They flat-out fooled this jury.'' Prosecutors declined immediate comment. In the trial, prosecutors alleged that <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> ordered the killing of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> in retribution for the agents' role in the seizure of a multimillion dollar load of marijuana destined for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The chief evidence against <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> came from government informants, including drug smugglers who said they heard him discuss the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> killing. The sole piece of physical evidence against <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was a single strand of his hair found at the <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> estate of <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> is believed to have been tortured and killed. Evidence at the trial showed the agent and pilot were tortured with red-hot metal pipes and beaten so severely that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s skull was crushed One witness who had a plea bargain with the government told of seeing <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> at the villa on the day of the murder and related a conversation in which Verdugo spoke of `` a problem'' that had been taken care of. Sentencing for <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was set for Oct. 26. The third defendant, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seafood company owner, is charged with helping <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> after the killings. The battered bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> were found at a remote Mexican ranch on March 5, 1985. Last Thursday, jurors convicted <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> of the murders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 24. In a related development, <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 37, and an associate, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, were convicted in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Thursday on narcotics and weapons charges. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> was sentenced to 34 years in prison and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> to 11 years. The 28-year-old <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a former member of the Mexican state police in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, was the subject of the trial's most dramatic evidence. Prosecutors showed jurors a secretly recorded videotape of <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> discussing details of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s death with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said on the tape that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s killing was a mistake that occurred when <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> `` got carried away.'' The cases against the two other defendants relied heavily on the testimony of informants and drug dealers. Physical evidence against all defendants was slim. Attorneys for Verdugo and <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> said they were victims of political corruption in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and an untruthful prosecution in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Nine men were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but only three were tried here. One defendant subsequently died. Four, including <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>, were tried in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on narcotics and murder charges. Verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges, including those of murder. Another defendant, former Mexican federal police commander <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavon-Reyes </PERSON>, was convicted and sentenced in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on charges of helping <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> escape.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared believable and warm and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seemed cold, calculating and expressionless, the traits seen in poker players or negotiators, a body language expert said a day after the two clashed in their first debate. `` I've been disappointed throughout the campaign because there has n't been much body language to watch,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggenbach </PERSON>, a communications expert who advises businessmen and others about leadership through verbal and non-verbal language. Sunday night's debate provided little more information; both men restricted by podiums and microphones. But there was enough to see to form an opinion. `` What I've drawn is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more believable and credible. He is much more animated than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I did n't see any expression in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' eyes. His eyes are very cold. They just do n't express anything.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eyes, however, were expressive. `` They twinkled, they sparkled, and in addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looked at his audience and his questioners,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looked at the camera and hardly ever changed his eye focus or the position of his head. He was almost like a robot.'' <PERSON> Riggenbach </PERSON>, 42, who teaches speech and drama, confesses to being a registered Republican but `` in between'' and objective in observing political candidates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> limited his gestures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was expansive, she observed. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had two gestures, one with one fist clenched, the other with both fists clenched and his arms tightly to his sides. `` Another gesture was the use of the half-palm, that is, if you put your palm up, then the fingers inward a quarter-rotation _ that was his other gesture.'' Palms down is negative, palms up is positive, she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she observed, was animated and `` very fluid.''

 A dispute over payment for milk in a store touched off four days of violence in an overcrowded slum that hospital officials said killed at least 12 people by Monday, including a police officer. Authorities called in the army and imposed a curfew on the area, which crackled with the sound of sporadic gunfire Monday. A police spokesman said three soldiers patrolling the area were believed to have been kidnapped early Monday, although no one immediately claimed responsibility. Enforcement officials searched for the missing soldiers. Police and residents said the violence began with a dispute Friday between youths and a store owner. `` It all started when some boys refused to pay for the milk they drank at a milk shop,'' said <PERSON> Mumtaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, an area resident. `` The owner wanted money and started beating the boys. Later, friends of the boys came to the shop and ransacked it.'' Four people died when police stepped in to end the dispute. A curfew ended the violence until Sunday, when residents in the area heard sporadic firing. A hospital spokesman said eight died Sunday.

 Citing the Iran-Iraq cease-fire agreement, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said Monday it will end <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ship-escorting operation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> while maintaining a presence there President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to terminate the close-quarter convoying of neutral commercial ships came after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reviewed how the Aug. 20 cease-fire was working, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The move substantially lowers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> profile in the troubled waters nearly three months after a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aegis </ORGANIZATION> cruiser shot down an Iranian civilian airliner with 290 people on board. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it regretted the accident, and officials have been weighing a program to compensate relatives of the victims. Talking to reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew here from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration decided to relax the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> sea-lane policing operation only after `` consulting with allies and friends in the region.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was urged to pass legislation imposing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as `` a concrete expression of congressional outrage against the use of chemical weapons.'' A vote on the resolution, which authorizes even sterner future sanctions if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> persists in its alleged poison gas attacks against it Kurdish minority, was postponed until Tuesday. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the legislation on grounds that it `` would not bring us closer'' to the goal of ending <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons. After making a farewell address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, and also had a session set for later Monday with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. During the meeting with the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> official, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked why the change was being made in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operation. `` It's just a little difference in the way it's being done. That's a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decision because of the new situation ... thus cease-fire.'' The president said he thought the emir would recognize that `` we are not lessening our protection of them at all.'' Asked if there was any chance of normalization with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, he said, `` You know me, I always hope. We're waiting to see what develops from this cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it would take a few days to revamp the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the region. He said there would no formal announcement when that takes place. In effect, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will replace its close-quarter escorting of commercial ships with a sort of arms-length surveillance operation. The formation was likened by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to a `` zone'' coverage of shipping rather than a `` man-to-man'' coverage. The analogy to a kind of coverage used in football means that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships will watch selected areas of the gulf for trouble, rather than focusing the protective operation on individual vessels. In his <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the world can feel `` the uplift of hope'' in the gulf war, which he called `` one of the bloodiest conflicts since World War II.'' `` The resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law, it helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis for peace,'' he said. During a brief exchange with reporters after a private meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he hoped the easing of tensions in that part of the world could lead to the release of nine Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian elements in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that because I have high hopes,'' the president said. `` I have high hopes.'' Asked if he thought a hostage-release could be achieved in the four months remaining in his administration, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't know if anything can be done that quickly, but we have n't let up.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said, however, that `` I'm superstitious about calling a no-hitter before the game is over.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sought to minimize the significance of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s off-hand remark `` What he said was, ` I do n't want to talk about hostages because it might be bad luck,' `` the spokesman said, saying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was alluding to a baseball superstitution that one never talks about a pitcher who might throw a no-hitter against opposing batters. White House chief of staff <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, asked whether something was in the works to advance the cause of the hostages, said, `` There is nothing new on that.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` there is no new morsel of information'' to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, and said `` there is no new signal'' indicating a hostage release. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that `` peace between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was uncertain,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at an afternoon briefing at the <ORGANIZATION> Waldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>. In announcing the phase-down of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship protection operation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> stressed that `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intends to maintain in the gulf the forces required to protect U.S.-flagged shipping and support our national objectives. These changes in no way alter our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf.'' The White House said that the modification in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation `` entails a change from a tight escort procedure to an ` accompany' regime In an accompany regime, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will be positioned such that they can take appropriate action if U.S.-flagged ships are directly threatened.'' There have been no attacks on neutral shipping in the gulf since the ceasefire began on Aug. 20. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy operation began 14 months ago and involved a precise <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> formation used to protect against potential Iranian attacks against Kuwaiti tankers re-registered under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 26 ships in its Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including 17 in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, as of Sept. 16. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> praised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday as `` generally positive'' and the kind of speech he should have used to begin his presidency, not end it. But it also found the speech `` acerbic'' at times and `` self-serving.'' Last year the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the target of harsh criticism by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> address. In a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech on Monday `` in general, positive ... Overall, it was good and tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- we will listen to the Soviet side'' when Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> speaks. `` I wish he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- had started his presidency with this kind of speech, not finish it,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s seventh and final address to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lectured the communist world last year, from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, on the virtues of democracy and private enterprise and the perceived inferiority of their own system. He praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for what he suggested was a unique harmony with `` the human heart,'' a quality he claimed was lacking in other forms of government. In 1987, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> condemned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>; this year he welcomed the Soviet withdrawal and encouraged an early withdrawal. Last year he condemned Soviet dictatatorship; this year he cited `` a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of our time _ totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war.'' This year, citing the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was able to speak `` to the young people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about the wonder and splendor of human freedom.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> commented, `` The president's upbeat mood, his optimism about where the world is going are things we completely agree with.'' `` We are also very glad to hear from him his appreciation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to maintain international peace and security,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` It is certainly a change in position, which we warmly welcome.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said it was positive that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited the easing of international relations, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said began in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` That sounds pretty good to us,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the areas of disagreement on a 50-percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons were decreasing and that a treaty could be signed within a year. `` Both sides wanted this in his administration,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` But it proved too difficult. But we agree that the sooner the better. Within a year is okay with us.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also agrees with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s call for a renegotiated global ban on the use of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made some `` acerbic remarks'' and `` self-serving'' comments about the superiority of democracy over Soviet socialism and restrictions on human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Actually,'' he said, `` the world is really changing.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to halt its massive aid to the Nicaraguan government and <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> remarked: `` In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we are pragmatic, we are not adding fuel to the conflict. `` We say the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Agreements must be fulfilled, and we are ready to not give aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stops its own aid to the Contra rebels,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. It seemed `` a little bit strange,'' he said, `` that the president of a big and powerful country raises the danger from small <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It does not sound convincing to us. `` The government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is ready to talk to the Contras, and I think the president exaggerates what really is happening there.'' The <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Agreements to which <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> referred was the signing of a peace plan by five Central American presidents on Aug. 7, 1987. The plan was designed by Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. One major goal of the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan was an end to all outside aid to the region's insurgencies.

 The man who Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says his opponent is `` ridiculing'' when he refers to his running mate as `` <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'' was an Army hero in World War II.

<TEXT>
 Third World countries led by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized nations in part Monday for perpetuating their poverty. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Abreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodre </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> told the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World economic picture was dimming `` due to the lack of progress in international economic relations.'' `` It is ... sad to note that we, American, Asian, African brothers, still suffer from the same horrors and the same desolation which so badly affected our forebears,'' he said, adding, `` hunger ... is endemically spreading throughout the continents.'' A similar theme sounded Monday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded `` more forceful action'' to help Third World countries repay $ 1.2 trillion in debts. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, with $ 121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the strongest Third World lobbyists for debt restructuring and writeoffs. It signed a comprehensive rescheduling agrement last week with its Western creditors. It is critical of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that strong economic performance in developed countries would trickle down to help the Third World. Foreign Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Obed </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Asamoah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> appealed to creditors to write off some debts and reschedule others. He urged nations to work together to raise commodity prices to strengthen African economies. `` In a market place where one group of operators is continually selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly, protection needs be given to the weak and vulnerable operators,'' he said. <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> had an estimated foreign debt last year of $ 2.8 billion. Officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the non-communist realm _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ have approved a plan to aid the world's poorest nations, mostly in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But Latin American countries also would like more help. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerutti </PERSON>, called for a `` new strategy of global development,'' including debt forgiveness. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has a $ 56 billion foreign debt. Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> said her country spends about 1.1 percent of its gross national product on loans and grants to developing countries, well above the average 0.34 percent by other developed countries. She urged other industrialized nations to increase financial aid, saying development and debt are related Third World crises. `` The industrialized countries of the North must now demonstrate that they see the poverty of the Third World as their common challenge,'' she said.

 A mock trial began Monday of industrialized nations, accused of using their financial muscle rather than military might to dominate developing nations. The prosecution is made up of a group of international activists called the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>, who opened their four-day `` trial'' of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The policies and influence of those institutions, now holding their annual meetings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, is tantamount to war on Third World nations, the activists charged. `` The Third World War has already started,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sociologist and author who has written extensively on connections between Third World debt and poverty. `` This war is a financial low-intensity conflict. It's a policing action, a way of projecting power into the Third World,'' she said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the mechanics of vision, expressed similar views. `` The debt has become a major instrument of domination of the Third World by First World nations,'' the 81-year-old scientist said. Ms. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, spoke at the start of the proceedings. <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professor, is one of 15 `` jury'' members. Both the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> declined requests by the tribunal to send someone to speak in their defense. <PERSON> Hellmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Sept. 13 the organizations have their own institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations. `` We do n't need such a tribunal,'' he said. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Triffin </PERSON> has agreed to independently `` defend'' the two organizations during the proceedings. In a speech that drew loud applause from about 300 people, Ms. <PERSON> George </PERSON> charged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using the massive Third World debt to control developing lands. `` The more intelligent people in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> discovered that an overt war -LRB- to control political conditions -RRB- with bombs and troops and a lot of television probably would result in protests at home,'' she said. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, through its banks, has a stranglehold on some developing countries. `` You can get your raw materials on the cheapest possible terms. And you can get control over the infrastructure of indebted countries, when debt is swapped for control over productive capacity,'' she said. `` The adversary is made to pay for his own oppression, just as occupying powers have always done.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said he agrees. `` The Third World debt is a marvelous instrument of control. And its advantage is, it's so large that it can never be paid back,'' he said. <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> singled out the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> for what he called `` harsh conditions it attaches to its lending.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has fashioned financial rescue packages for heavily indebted countries that call for changes in economic policies to bring about healthier growth. `` Such programs,'' he argued, `` impose further deprivation upon what are already some of the world's poorest people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lelio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Rome-based human rights organization founded by <PERSON> Lelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON>, an Italian political activist who died in 1978.

 An activist who campaigned against organized crime was killed by gunmen Monday, one day after a judge who sentenced two crime bosses to prison was killed, authorities said. Government officials said the judge's slaying is a sign that organized crime figures are trying to intimidate authorities. `` This is a crime with the clear stamp of the Mafia, aimed at intimidation,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> said Monday. Magistrate <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>, 66, and his son <PERSON> Stefano </PERSON>, 35, were slain Sunday by gunmen who shadowed their car, rammed it with their vehicle and stopped it on a country road ouside <LOCATION> Caltanisetta </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. The assailants fired at least 20 shots through the windows. On Monday, meanwhile, attackers fired on <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostagno </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Trapani </LOCATION> as he drove home from an appearance on local television to discuss drug abuse and organized crime influence, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police in the western Sicilian town called the killing `` Mafia-style'' but said it was under investigation. <PERSON> Rostagno </PERSON> was a leader of `` Continous Fight,'' a leftist organization that organized protests during the 1960s and 1970s. He moved to <PERSON> Trapani </PERSON> a decade ago and founded a drug rehabilitation center. <PERSON> Rostagno </PERSON>, 46, appeared regularly on a local television program, campaigning against drug use and organized crime. <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> had sentenced two powerful crime bosses, brothers <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, to life in prison. `` This assassination is a very serious signal as to how deep and difficult to extract are the roots of the evil plant of organized crime,'' President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> killing. Authorities have linked the slayings of eight magistrates since 1968 to organized crime. Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said the reaction of political forces `` has to be strong and united.'' <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> flew to the island of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> on Monday for a meeting with authorities there about the killing. Besides the <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> trial, <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> presided over the trial of three organized crime figures convicted of killing Capt. <PERSON> Emanuele </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> of the carabinieri, or national police. The <ORGANIZATION> Grecos </ORGANIZATION> were convicted of masterminding the killing of Judge <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinnici </PERSON>, who had been investigating their activities.

 A gunman walked into an elementary school and opened fire Monday, killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring 10 other people, authorities said. Police Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> had been arrested and charged with murder. No motive for the shootings was determined. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said that shortly after 11 a.m., <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> entered <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s front door, walked to the cafeteria, pulled a .22 caliber, nine-shot revolver from his belt and opened fire, injuring one teacher and three students. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom where teacher <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> tried to prevent him from leaving after he reloaded, <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said. In the scuffle that followed, Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> was shot in the mouth and hand, he said. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> evaded Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> and entered a classroom two doors away, where he opened fire again, injuring a teacher and five students and killing one of the students. After firing all bullets in his pistol, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> dropped the weapon and Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON>, unarmed, ordered him to raise his hands and stand until a police officer arrived. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON>'s chronology of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s actions, given during an evening news conference, differed from that given earlier in the day by school officials. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> would not answer questions after making a prepared statement and did not resolve the conflicting versions. <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been living with his paternal grandmother in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, but traveled to his maternal grandmother's home earlier Monday. There, he said, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> took a gun without his grandmother's knowledge, then stopped at a department store, where he bought two boxes of ammunition <PERSON> Coursey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> then returned to <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> and went to the school. District 50 Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said he knew of no connection between the assailant and the school. `` It appears to be an entirely random incident. The classroom was chosen randomly,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. There were about 100 children in the cafeteria when the shooting occurred and about 21 children in the third-grade classroom, he said. Witnesses said some children ran into the woods when the man began shooting. Physical education aide <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said that after the gunman quit firing, he threw the pistol down and walked out as if nothing had happened. `` He remained calm and offered no resistance,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. The dead child was identified as <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>. The 10 injurd were taken to Self Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, where two pupils, Ms. <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON> and another teacher remained hospitalized, said spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON>. He said they `` suffered fractures ... a number of gunshot wounds.'' A 7-year-old girl was in critical condition and undergoing surgery; the others were in fair condition, he said. Six students were treated and released. After the shooting, teachers directed students to the front lawn, counted them and checked attendance rolls. The school was evacuated as state troopers, police officers, sheriff's deputies and school officials arrived. Officers and volunteers combed the woods for children who might be hiding. Some parents came to pick up their children while buses lined up to take others home. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said she was in the school office to pick up her 7-year-old granddaughter who was sick. `` While we were standing there, I heard gunshots. All of a sudden, teachers were running, children screaming, hollering ` he's shooting, he's shooting,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said `` I got mine into the nurse's lounge and waited there until the teacher that got shot in the mouth came in with the little girl that got shot in the neck and four or five other kids,'' she said. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Amick </PERSON>, a first-grade teacher, said she and her students fled the cafeteria after she saw a man waving a gun around. They exited through a back door and ran toward the woods. Her class sought shelter in a house across the street from the school until she saw other classes assemble outside. She said she comforted her students by telling them everyone in their class was OK. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said classes had been canceled for Tuesday and that children would receive counseling when they returned Wednesday <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> city manager, described the town's mood as very solemn. `` Everyone pretty much is saying they have read about these types of things in other areas but never thought it would happen in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> issued a statement of sympathy for the slain child's family and other victims and praised teachers for acting quickly to protect the students. `` There are no words to adequately express the feelings of all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinians </LOCATION> as a result of the tragedy which occurred in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> today. ... I was shocked and saddened by the brutal and senseless act which took the life of a little, 8-year-old girl and wounded 10 others,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` I would like to personally express my appreciation to the teachers who, I am told, acted quickly to protect the children. Their actions possibly saved lives,'' the governor said.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Maoist rebels ambushed an army truck in the highlands Monday and killed five soldiers and wounded six in a crossfire after crippling the vehicle with land mines, police said. Also Monday, the military command in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> state said an army patrol killed two rebels in a clash with a column of Shining Path guerrillas Sept. 20. The ambush Monday occurred on a lonely mountain road 27 miles east of <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION>, a state capital 155 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Police said rebels had mined a 100-yard stretch of dirt road with dynamite every 10 yards and that at least nine charges exploded as the truck passed. A lieutenant and four soldiers were killed. Eight soldiers who escaped harm and some of the six wounded troops managed to repel the attack and the Shining Path guerrillas withdrew after half an hour, according to the police report. Police said the rebels were believed to have suffered casualties but took their wounded with them. In <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, a state capital 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Huancavelica </LOCATION> and 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the military command said a patrol encountered a rebel column on Sept. 20, killing two guerrillas in the ensuing firefight. A military communique said troops captured arms, grenades and subversive pamphlets in the shootout but that other members of the guerrilla force escaped. The communique did not say if the patrol suffered casualties. The impoverished countryside around <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> was the birthplace eight years of the Mao-inspired Shining Path insurgency. Since then the violence has spread through much of the country and more than 12,000 people have been killed.

 Terrorists who fired on the car of a government finance official have been linked to slayings in 1985 and 1986, authorities said Monday. Objects found in a car used by the assailants were `` of a similar nature'' to evidence from the 1985 slaying of industrialist <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> and the 1986 killing of diplomat <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braunmuehl </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office. Prechtel would not elaborate. Attackers last week fired on the car of <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON>, the No. 2 official in the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Neither <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> nor his driver were hurt. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most notorious terrorist gang, claimed responsibility, saying its plans to kill <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON> were thwarted by a jammed rifle. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials linked the attack to this week's joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund annual meetings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tietmeyer </PERSON>, a key adviser to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, was actively involved in planning for the talks. On Saturday, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said investigators identified <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogefeld </PERSON> as one of the assailants. He said <PERSON> Hogefeld </PERSON> rented the car under an assumed name before the attack. The car was later found in a <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> suburb a few miles from the attack site.

 An F-14 fighter jet assigned to the USS <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> crashed into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Monday, but the two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fliers who ejected after smoke engulfed the cockpit were rescued, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. It was the fifth crash involving the $ 44 million supersonic jet in the past month, including one at the civilian <LOCATION> Gillespie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that killed a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flier and injured four people on the ground. There have been 99 accidental losses of the aircraft since the jet's introduction to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fleet in 1972, according to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records. The latest crash occurred while the F-14, part of a squadron based at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Miramar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, conducted routine flight operations, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. The pilot and radar intercept officer, whose names were not immediately available, reported smoke and fumes in the cockpit shortly before bailing out about 10 miles from the carrier, <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. A chopper was dispatched from the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> and the two were plucked from the water and returned to the ship. `` Both appear to be in good health with no injuries,'' <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said. The plane sank into the ocean and is not recoverable, he said. The carrier was in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, just outside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is disturbed by the rash of F-14 accidents but has no plans to ground the aircraft because there is no common thread linking the crashes. `` They are all unrelated and dissimilar,'' he said. `` Without a trend developing and with no known mechanical defect as a suspect, there's no reason to ground them while the incident investigations continue.'' He said that prior to Sept. 8, the date of the first of the five F-14 accidents over the past month, the aircraft had gone through 387 accident-free days. <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON> said that the investigations on those five F-14 accidents remain open. `` You can bet we're going to be looking very, very hard at all aspects of our program,'' he said. `` The bottom line is we want zero mishaps. Everything that can be done to achieve that goal is being done.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged his supporters to go door-to-door to sign up new voters who he said could provide a margin of victory for Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November's general election `` As the Bible tells us, there's power in the word, and the vote is the word,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told more than 1,000 people Sunday at the founding conference for the state chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a multiracial network that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> founded. He said voters should go `` door-to-door, church-to-church, synagogue-to-synagogue, school-to-school, and along the highways and byways of this state'' to register voters.

 Mammoth sumo wrestlers joined crowds outside the Imperial Palace on Monday to pray for 87-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose condition stabilized despite continued internal bleeding. `` The emperor is in stable condition ... but last night he discharged a slight amount of blood,'' <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, head of general affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters early Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had a fever of 98.4 Tuesday, down from around 99 Monday but still higher than his normal temperature of 95.9. On Saturday it rose to 102.6, prompting concern about his fate, palace officials said. The stock market was up in early trading Tuesday after fluctuating Monday, reflecting uncertainty over <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s health. <PERSON> Majiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueda </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage, said reports the emperor was in stable condition encouraged investors to trade more actively. On Monday, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> watched television dramas and received his sons, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitachi </PERSON>, and their wives for brief chats, palace <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. The emperor's imperial duties were transferred to <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, last Thursday. The sumo wrestlers, dressed in silk robes, added their names Monday to registries to wish <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> well. Palace officials said more than 450,000 well-wishers have journeyed to the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 registry sites across the country. Doctors found traces of blood in the emperor's bowels for the fourth straight day, indicating an intestinal hemorrhage had not been contained. They administered another .43 pints in blood transfusions, bringing the total since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> first vomited blood Sept. 19 to 5.96 pints. The nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> quoted medical experts Monday as saying cancer was the likely cause of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s continuous discharge of blood Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports that the emperor has cancer and instead have urged the Japanese media to refrain from speculation. Cancer is rarely acknowledged publicly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Outside the moats surrounding the forested imperial compound, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant telephone company, installed a row of free public phones so well-wishers could call home. `` We wanted to do something to be helpful to all the people who have come out of concern for the emperor,'' said <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoh </PERSON>, a company official. More than 16,000 people have used the phones, he added, most to tell their families they had recorded their names. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third-largest newspaper apologized for an editorial inadvertently published in its English-language editions expressing sadness at the emperor's demise. `` We deeply regret the completely erroneous editorial, retract it in entirety, and apologize deeply,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not explain how the slip at the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> had occurred. The newspaper also apologized to the government and the palace.

 Most state unemployment insurance funds would have to borrow billions from the federal government to pay benefits in a future recession because of inadequate reserves, according to a congressional report released today. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study found the Unemployment Insurance system's ability to cushion economic hard times for many Americans has declined as states have tried to manage their financially troubled programs.

However, in a survey taken in late August and early September, that view was held by a smaller but still substantial 47 percent of the panel.

 The unemployment insurance system has enough reserves to last only five months in a severe recession and would have to borrow billions of dollars from the federal government to keep paying benefits, congressional watchdogs said Monday. Because states had to borrow $ 11.8 billion to keep paying benefits during the 1981-82 recession, most have tightened eligibility requirements so much that only one of every four jobless workers in October of last year received unemployment checks, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. `` The average proportion of unemployed receiving benefits during the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent received benefits.''

 Chileans gave overwhelmingly approval to a new constitution eight years ago, and military leaders called it grassroots acceptance of the way they had governed since seizing power in 1973.

That candidate is Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, ruler for the past 15 years. The referendum is set for this week. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is at a crossroads.

 A geographical stringbean between the Andes and the sea, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> always seemed separate and distinct from other countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It had the longest tradition of democracy. Its schools and universities forged a highly literate society: more than 90 percent of its people can read and write. It dug a wealth of copper from its mountainsides, harvested rich crops from its soil and plucked fish in abundance from its seas. In contrast to its neighbors who lurched from one military dictator or civilian strongman to another, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> lived in relatively prosperous stability in the years after achieving independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1818. But in 1970, Chilean stability began to falter following the election to the presidency of <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a self-declared Marxist whose change in direction from the past brought political and economic disorder. On the morning of Sept. 11, 1973, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s long tradition of elected, representative government came to an end. The military, declaring the nation on the verge of a communist takeover, seized power in a bloody coup. Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the coup leader, became president in a military dictatorship. He has remained in office for 15 years. On Wednesday, Oct. 5, the 7 million registered voters among <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 12 million people will be asked to decide in a yes-no referendum whether they want the 72-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to stay on as their leader for eight more years _ until 1997. `` Joy is coming,'' goes an election campaign jingle of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s opponents, confidently predicting his demise in Wednesday's referendum. `` The Marxists are coming,'' counters a pro-Pinochet television advertisement, meaning a vote against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would set <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> back to the Allende years of the early 1970s. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> stands this week on the doorstep of a future blurred by two radically distinct ideological visions. The deep split between <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s opponents and backers tends to color the country's troubled past and its present as well <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is the sole candidate in the referendum, which has spawned reflection and debate on the merits of his administration and on the chain of events that led to his seizing power. Allende's leftist policies and the fierce opposition to them set off widespread economic and social upheaval, including paralyzing strikes and street violence, shortages of basic goods and an angry polarization of society that has left deep scars. In the aftermath, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional investigation found that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> financed efforts to destabilize <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s government. It also found that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had substantial investments in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, financed efforts to prevent <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> from taking office after he was elected. Allende nationalized <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> after assuming the presidency and the corporation left <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> long before <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s coup in 1973. Historians today debate whether the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement had a real impact, and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> denies any direct foreign involvement in the coup or its planning. Upon taking power, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> declared a mission to purge the nation of what he saw as communism and to forge a society he envisioned as based on the values of family, hard work and love of country. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and his supporters say the coup saved <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, even though it snapped a decades-long chain of democratically elected governments. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died in the coup, his supporters charging he was killed by soldiers and the military claiming he committed suicide with a weapon given him by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. All Chileans agree that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15 years of military rule have been marked by profound change. They argue heatedly, however, whether it has been for better or for worse. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s supporters talk of a `` silent revolution'' in which <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has become a modern, efficient nation with a stable economic base. They claim to see an emergence from Third World underdevelopment. The country is in its fifth straight year of steady economic growth, with the gross national product projected to rise 6 percent in 1988. The official inflation rate has declined to about 10 percent a year, a fraction of the Latin American average. The foreign debt of $ 20 million is being paid off on time, and is actually shrinking. Export earnings have soared and are projected at $ 6.8 billion this year, up 46 percent from 1984. Foreign investment is at unprecedented levels, surpassing $ 300 million in the first six months of 1988 alone. Once-bloated state industries have been streamlined and, in dozens of cases, auctioned off whole or in part to private business. In his campaign, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> promises growth and stability. `` We ca n't turn our back on progress,'' he told the nation recently, maintaining that his defeat in the referendum would bring back leftist experiments and the chaos of the Allende years. Even his critics give his economic performance at least faint praise. `` There has been a positive macro-economic policy in the last four years,'' said <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, vice-president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, who spoke in an interview, and other <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> foes say most Chileans are still struggling to recover from a fierce recession in 1982, which they blame on a radical free-market experiment launched after the coup and only later modified. In addition, the recent boom has benefited the rich much more than any other social group. `` <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has destroyed the middle class,'' <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON> contended.

<HEAD>SANTIAGO: Zaldivar contended.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 According to economist <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, `` Those with higher incomes have achieved a level -LRB- of income -RRB- almost 25 percent higher than in 1982. Workers and medium-income groups have not yet recovered the levels they had before the'82 recession.'' In any event, the opposition contends, any economic advances are more than overshadowed by a grim legacy of human rights abuse. More than 700 people were arrested and disappeared during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule, most of them in a wave of official repression following the coup that affected thousands of dissidents. The number of atrocities has declined in recent years but illegal arrest, beating and torture of leftists persists, according to international and local human rights groups. `` Impunity still continues for those who violate human rights,'' said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, a lawyer for the local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights agency. Shadowy bands of armed civilians threaten, shoot at and sometimes kidnap and torture opposition activists, he said in an interview. `` We are convinced of an association between these apparently private terror groups and -LRB- official -RRB- security organs.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> insists that tough action was necessary to turn the Marxist tide represented by <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> and remains needed to stem subversion, including two active communist guerrilla organizations. But with his electoral campaign in full swing, and critics calling for greater political freedom, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lifted states of emergency that had persisted since he took power. He also ended a ban on the return of more than 300 leftists in exile. He pledged that his new government would be fully democratic, while retaining certain anti-communist safeguards. The constitution, crafted in 1980 by his administration and overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, formally bans Marxism. The same document outlines a phased return to democracy, requiring the upcoming referendum and a re-establishment of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which was disbanded after the coup. If a majority votes yes in the referendum, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will begin a new eight-year term in March. The military junta, which theoretically served as the legislative branch of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government, will be disbanded The new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be seated in 1990, two-thirds elected and the remaining third appointed by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. If the electorate rejects <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will stay on as president but an open election must be held in a year. He then must step down in 1990. No matter what the outcome of the referendum, congressional elections will be held in 1990, but the legislature will have limited authority. It will be virtually powerless to amend the 1980 constitution, which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory role in national policy-making. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he hopes to see the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> filled with `` a new generation of leaders'' who put the nation's welfare ahead of party interests. He portrays his chief opponents as people eager for personal gain and power, and too busy feuding among themselves to provide coherent leadership. For years the opposition had been chronically divided. This past February, however, 16 parties ranging from the center-right to the socialist left formed a united front, called the Command for the NO Vote. With an unusual degree of cooperation, they have agreed on a moderate political platform and have launched a grassroots campaign. Party leaders who once battled each other now embrace at crowded anti-Pinochet rallies. `` There has been a process of maturation in the opposition,'' said <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrigada </PERSON>, the coalition's general secretary. He said political parties had realized their feuding only helped <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> gain and keep power. Confident of getting a no-vote and defeating <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum, opposition leaders said they will seek talks with the military to speed up the open elections and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s replacement with a four-year transitional government. They claim the military will be willing to negotiate once their commander is defeated. There is no indication yet, however, of a conciliatory spirit in <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s army, by far the most powerful branch of the armed forces. Several top army officers are openly politicking for him, and the vice-commander, Gen. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, has declared that troops are `` in a state of readiness'' to defend their leader and Constitution.

 Ten years ago, <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtyla </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, assumed the papacy, ushering in a decade of activism that has seen Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II travel the world, attempt to bring an unruly flock into line and suffer the jolt of schism in the ranks. He has drawn the admiration of many as he assumes the role of a world leader on matters of peace and social justice, speaking out on causes ranging from the rights of Latin American peasants to the plight of Palestinians. He has also upset many Roman Catholics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere by his consistent doctrinal conservatism. No pope has ever traveled so much and delivered so many speeches, embarking on a path to prepare his church for the next century, when the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> expects there will be 1 billion Roman Catholics in the world. The 10 years have allowed the pope to place like-minded conservatives in key dioceses and in the Curia, the church's central administration, and to put his people into the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, which serves as an advisory body and elects his successor From the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, there have been crackdowns on dissent, the censuring of several prominent theologians. Among North American and Western European Catholics have been signs of alienation and a feeling among some women that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is unsympathetic to their aspirations. The pope was particularly upset when traditionalist French Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> ordained new bishops on June 30 without his approval, provoking the first significant schism in the church in more than a century. The pope was described as deeply pained and bishops asked Catholics to rally around him. Wounded in an assassination attempt seven years ago and now 68, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has perhaps slowed down a step. He often appears tired and drawn, although <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials insist he's lost none of his drive to set down his vision of the church. `` To say, as many have, that the present bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> does not understand the church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or in other parts of the free world is not to condemn him,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McBrien </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> theologian, said in a comment published in a 1988 anthology `` The Church in Anguish.'' `` He seems to assume that the only effective way to combat our common enemies in today's world, atheism and materialism, is through a completely united front. No dissent, no public quarreling, no breaking from the ranks.'' The year 1978, the `` year of the three popes,'' saw the death of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> after a 15-year-papacy and the death of his successor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, after only 33 days. Then, on Oct. 16, the cardinals elected Archbishop <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtyla </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> as the first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years and the first Pole ever. At 58, young for a pope and coming from a Communist country where the church has traditionally been a second center of power, <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtyla </PERSON> seemed the ideal man to head a growing church still in turmoil from the changes initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and battling the challenge of Marxism. He has pursued his goals energetically and encouraged his bishops to do likewise, whether through an unsuccessful attempt in 1981 to overturn <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s law allowing abortions or the successful effort to permit his meeting with political opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> last June. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> says the church has an obligation to speak out on moral issues but that priests and nuns have no business in partisan politics. Throughout the decade, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has been critical of both liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism. Among his visions is a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> united by its common Christian roots. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s attempt to pursue its agenda in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> appeared to suffer a setback when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was wounded by a Turkish gunman May 13, 1981. There were allegations _ never proven _ that the shooting was inspired by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to halt <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s support for the independent Solidarity labor movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leading the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, relations between the Soviets and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> have improved to the point where the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sent a senior delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year for the celebration of a major religious event by the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. There has even been talk of a papal visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, although nothing immediate is expected.

 Another focus has been <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where he has sought to weed out Marxist liberation theology by church activists while seeking to counter inroads made by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> sects. Nine of the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s 39 trips have been to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reflecting <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> interest in a region expected to include half the world's Catholics by the year 2000. The Vatican estimates that Catholics now number 850 million worldwide. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has repeatedly stressed the church's `` option for the poor'' but has refused to tolerate the more openly political liberation theologists such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Boff </PERSON>, who in 1985 was punished with a year of `` obedient silence'' for criticizing what he called the church's `` feudal hierarchy.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arns </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a leading human rights advocate and a sort of patron of liberation theologists in the world's largest Catholic country, has praised the pope for encouraging church leaders to work for greater social equality. `` In <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where the abyss between the rich and poor is immense, where traditionally the elites rule with scandalous egotism, the words of the pope have encouraged bishops, priests and laymen in a common struggle for a new society marked by signs of faith, of hope and of fraternity,'' <PERSON> Arns </PERSON> said in an interview. The pope has frequently reached out to other Christian denominations and religions, convening a multi-faith prayer session in <LOCATION> Assisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, in October 1986. But he has said that the ordination of women in the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> poses an obstacle to church unity and has angered Jews by receiving <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and meeting with Austrian President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, who has been linked to Nazi war crimes. It is often said that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON> breathed new life into the church by calling the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, 1962-65, that produced major changes in the liturgy, the church's relations with other religions and its view of its role in the world. If <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s successor, Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>, was seen as troubled by doubts and inclined to compromise, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> steers the church with obvious self-assurance. A close aide to the pope told this story to describe how <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> runs his church: This summer, while on vacation in the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> indicated he wanted to climb a narrow, risky trail to reach a cross planted atop a peak. He sounded out his aides, who all advised against the climb, but decided to do it anyway. `` It's not that he does n't listen to advice. But once he makes up his mind, nothing can change it,'' said the aide, who asked that his name not be used. Although <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials dismiss the suggestion that the pope has little interest in the superdeveloped Western societies, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is clearly counting on the church's growth in the less developed nations. Vatican figures show, for example, that most of the increases among seminarians are in the Third World. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is one area the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is counting on for such growth, and the pope has made several trips to that continent. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has twice visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 1987 pilgrimage allowed for candid criticism from the ranks, but the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was unbudging and made it clear that it was a `` grave error'' to believe dissent from church teaching was compatible with being a good <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Troublesome issues among North American Catholics include mandatory priestly celibacy and the ban on women becoming priests, prohibitions on contraceptives, divorce and abortion. `` We're not going to have a sufficient number of qualified priests if they have to be male celibates,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, a theology professor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The pope recently affirmed that the church is determined to do all it can to fight discrimination against women and has written a document on the issue. But some American nuns have been among the pope's strongest critics. There have also been differences over the role national bishops' conferences should play as a body and investigations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seminaries and religious orders The pope's world vision, as laid out in a social encyclical in February, drew some questioning from the Catholic right, usually his strongest defenders. `` World peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders come to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic, military or political imperialism, and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wrote.

 Here are significant quotations from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in his 10-year pontificate: `` Even if I can not express myself well in your ... our Italian language, if I make a mistake you will correct me,'' to the crowd in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square in his first public appearance after election as first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years, Oct. 16, 1978. `` -LRB- Man -RRB- can not become the slave of things, the slave of economic systems, the slave of production, the slave of his own products,'' his first encyclical, `` Redemptor Hominis,'' issued March 15, 1979. `` Never lose your trust, do not be defeated, do not be discouraged; do not cut yourselves off from the roots from which we had our origins,'' farewell Mass in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> on first trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, June 10, 1979. `` I pray for that brother of ours who shot me, and whom I have sincerely pardoned,'' from his hospital bed, May 17, 1981, four days after being wounded by a Turkish gunman, <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Agca </PERSON>. `` I came here as a herald of peace to proclaim a gospel of peace and a message of reconciliation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, June 2, 1982, ending historic trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during Falklands war. `` No human law can morally justify induced abortion ... nor can the behavior of local authorities in trying to limit the responsible freedom of parents to decide whether to procreate children be allowed on the moral plane,'' address in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, Oct. 13, 1984. `` You yourselves are witnesses of the appreciation and gratitude of the faithful when you do n't get mixed up in interests of an ideological or political nature, which are foreign to the Bible and to the demands of your vocation,'' to priests in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, July 5, 1986. `` It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the magisterium is totally compatible with being a ` good Catholic' and poses no obstacle to the reception of the sacraments. This is a grave error that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere,'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Sept. 16, 1987. `` For world peace is inconceivable unless the world's leaders come to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment of the politics of blocs, the sacrifice of all forms of economic, military or political imperialism and the transformation of mutual distrust into collaboration,'' from the social encyclical ` Sollicitudo Rei Socialis,'' Feb. 19, 1988. `` As I stressed last year before representatives of Jewish communities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Jewish people has a right to a country of its own, as any other nation has under international law. The same, however, holds for the Palestinian people, many of whom have become homeless and are refugees,'' to the Austrian Jewish community, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, June 24, 1988. `` With great distress the church has observed the illegitimate ordination of bishops performed June 30 by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>. ... This act of disobedience _ which constitutes the outright rejection of the Roman primate _ constitutes a schismatic act,'' letter to bishops, July 2, 1988

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is so well-traveled that the focus has shifted to where he has n't visited instead of where he has already stopped. Since setting out for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> three months after assuming the papacy 10 years ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has made 39 foreign pilgrimages, stopping in 72 countries. Easily the most traveled <PERSON> pope </PERSON> in history, he has flown some 370,000 miles, including his trip to southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in mid-September. That's like traveling from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and more than halfway back. But if he has visited every continent but <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, he has yet to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Holy Land. Early in his pontificate, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> described himself as a pilgrim messenger who would travel the world to see his flock. He has kept his word, far surpassing Pope <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>, the first jet age pontiff who became known as the `` apostle on the move.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> made nine overseas trips from 1964 to 1970, when, weary and 72, he halted all foreign travel. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has made nine trips to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> alone, reflecting the importance the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> attaches to a region expected to contain half the world's Roman Catholics by the turn of the century. He has also paid four visits to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the church has been making inroads, as well as three pilgrimages to his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and two to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The trips are central to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s papacy. He has bristled at suggestions he should spend more time at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statistics say he is away less than 8 percent of his pontificate -RRB- or that the trips cost too much. He chose a bishops conference in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on his first trip, to reject Marxist-inspired liberation theology. He influenced the mood of his fellow Poles during his 1979 pilgrimage that helped lead to the birth of the Solidarity free trade union, and he expounded church teaching to Americans in 1987, saying that dissent was incompatible with being a good <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Still to come are a trip later this year to <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to address the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and a visit to <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> next year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s hopes of visiting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have not yet been realized. He has disclosed that he's been prevented from visiting <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, the Roman Catholic stronghold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and insists that he must be allowed to visit with his flock on any pilgrimage. The Holy Land is an especially delicate case. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> made a whirlwind visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1964, but that was three years before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took over predominantly <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not established diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has stressed that the Palestinians, like the Jews, have a right to a homeland. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says it is premature for the pope to visit apartheid <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and Communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. There has been no invitation from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which broke relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1957 and established its own breakaway Catholic church.

 He was notably a busy man on the high-minded <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION> campus, which would have surprised no one who'd seen <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in action at <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> High. He was big in sports, big in student government and long on A's. In high school and college, he was always reckoned among the brainiest. But, active as he was, he was never `` a rah-rah guy,'' as a college friend recalls. `` He'd rather do something about an issue.''

 Looking back on those halcyon -LRB- also the name of the yearbook -RRB- days, college chums are undecided whether <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s barber shop on the third floor of <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> or courses nicknamed `` Ditch Digging and Sewage Disposal 1 & amp; 2'' gave distant early warning of a future Democratic presidential candidate. Of course it was the `` D'' in general physics that discouraged freshman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from becoming a physician, like his Greek immigrant father, and inspired <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION>'s now best-selling T-shirt: `` Anywhere else, it would have been an A.'' Practical politics, solving problems in state and local government, as taught in the early'50s by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ylvisaker </PERSON>, intrigued the scholarship student who had graduated second in a class of 439 at intellectually top-drawer <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In a matter of weeks, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who in those days was never called `` Duke'' and rarely `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,'' was ringing doorbells in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and handing out campaign literature for <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the reform candidate who became the first Democrat in 70 years to capture <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s city hall. `` <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> has always been pretty liberal, an egghead campus where kids think they can change the world,'' says <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who was a year ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and now is director of psychological services at the college. `` But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was n't a rah-rah guy. He'd sooner do something about an issue than attend rallies and demonstrations.'' `` Theory was n't his bag,'' adds professor emeritus <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennock </PERSON>, summoning up a memory of a dark-eyed lad seated Buddha-style on his living room floor for those afternoon seminars on political theory. `` His arguments were sound, well-researched, but he was less aggressive and less talkative without a real problem to sink his teeth into.'' Actually it was <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, his <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> buddy and now head of <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, who proposed boycotting the three barber shops down in `` the vill,'' the village, when they refused to cut the hair of three Nigerian students. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made it work by wielding the comb and clippers in the dorm and sometimes out on the lawn. Some recall his charging 50 cents, others say 65 cents, for a `` flattop,'' the only styling offered. `` There may have been a two-tier price structure, depending on what the trade would bear,'' mused associate provost emeritus <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Stott </PERSON>, who as admissions officer back then coaxed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> into entering <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> over a dinner cooked by his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` He was being penny-wise as well as striking a blow for racial equality. Barbering gave him some pocket money.'' Classmate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> patent attorney, surmises the barber of <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION> may have been a youthful edition of the tightwad governor who picks his suits off the rack, still shops for specials at the supermarket, grew his own lettuce on the front lawn when the price hit 89 cents a head, pushes a 25-year-old snow blower and often rides `` the T,'' the suburban trolley, from <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` But with a captive audience in the chair, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> never could resist politics,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> recalls. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieverts </PERSON>, his roommate, told us the hotter the argument got, the faster the hair flew.'' A couple of Christmas cards ago, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stott </PERSON> enclosed a $ 1 campaign contribution, suggesting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> run for president. `` I like being governor,'' the reply came back but, <PERSON> Stott </PERSON> says, `` he kept the dollar.'' <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> is a small college, then as now with only about half of <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000 enrollment, but lush as a landscape from the brush of colonial painter <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, whose house is at the edge of the 380-acre campus that flourishes as an arboretum of rare trees. Daffodils, azaleas, dogtooth violets, lilacs and rhododendrons in seasonal succession perfume the paths of <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, where in the delicate euphemism of the Halcyon editors `` couples took field trips in Baudelaire.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was attracted by the beauty of the campus when, as a high school senior, he visited <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for a week in a class exchange program. That <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> was coed and small enough for almost half the student body to take part in varsity sports also proved persuasive. <ORGANIZATION> Brookline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> had conditioned him for <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION>'s heady intellectual climate. `` He was brilliant, got all A's _ is n't that disgusting?'' marvels <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Bakalar </PERSON>, his high school sweetheart. She was secretary of the student council when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> solved the problem of broken milk bottles in the lunch room by having the distributor deliver paper cartons. `` But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> lost a big election in senior year: <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wool </PERSON> beat him out for class president.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> used a futuristic fork-lift to dispatch an alien beast during a climactic fight in the movie `` Aliens,'' it was a real-life triumph for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The image of the lifter _ which bore the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> logo _ being pushed to its limit in triumph over an evil force was powerful enough. But the positive exposure to <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> from the box-office success of the film surprised officials of the Peoria-based company. `` We had a number of people calling and writing in wanting to buy the machine,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and promotion division. `` We had to explain to people that the machine in the movie does n't exist.'' The cinematic victory _ and accompanying wide public promotion of its machines as tough and versatile _ resulted from the work of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> agent. The company for two years has employed <ORGANIZATION> UPP </ORGANIZATION> Entertainment Marketing of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> to help it find scripts that would give its equipment a high, positive profile in motion pictures and television, and to protect itself from negative exposure. `` We like to be selective so our machines do n't come off as the heavy in a movie,'' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want another movie like ` Killdozer.''' In that 1974 made-for-television movie, a thinly-disguised <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> tractor became possessed by aliens and proceeded to wreak havoc on the residents of a small island. `` It was going around wiping out people,'' <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said. `` Of course, we got up in arms about it because they made the machine look like a killer. We want people to see our machines for their contributions to society: building roads and homes and removing piles of snow in the winter.'' The classic movie `` Grapes of Wrath'' also made <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> officials cringe as company equipment was used to destroy a home and came to symbolize the oppressive force that forced Dust Bowl victims off their land. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> declined an opportunity for its machines to appear in the recent <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> movie, `` Batteries Not Included.'' `` In that movie, the construction company was the bad guy and <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> equipment would have been used to tear down a hotel and cafe where a bunch of old folks lived,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION>. `` They had nowhere else to go.'' That's typical of what movie-makers have in mind for heavy equipment, <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON> said. And Caterpillar is the equipment of preference, he said. `` That's the problem,'' <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON> said. `` We probably keep them out of more films than we get them into. Caterpillar is a sensitive company and does n't want to offend the sensibilities of its target market.'' Although Caterpillar ca n't control the use of its equipment, <PERSON> McMullen </PERSON> often dissuades negative portrayals, sometimes with threats of legal action. But Caterpillar always is ready for heroic roles, such as fighting a creature in `` Aliens,'' stopping an oil well fire on `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and constructing a pipeline on `` Dynasty.'' Later this year, three large tractors will appear in the comedy `` Fugitives'' with <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>. In the December television special `` A Brady Christmas,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> wheel-loader saves the day, and the <ORGANIZATION> Brady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bunch </ORGANIZATION>, from disaster at a construction site. `` We have never paid anyone to use Caterpillar equipment in a movie,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Axt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising department. `` People think this involves big money but it really only involves a convenience. `` We make it convenient or very easy for filmmakers to use Caterpillar equipment and we usually share the costs.''

 Most state unemployment insurance funds would have to borrow billions from the federal government to pay benefits in a future recession because of inadequate reserves, according to a congressional report released today. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study found the Unemployment Insurance system's ability to cushion economic hard times for many Americans has declined as states have tried to manage their financially troubled programs. Created to help working people make it through economic hard times, the state trusts are tightening eligibility requirements solely to keep their books in the black, leaving more Americans to face a bleak future if a recession strikes, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Only one in four unemployed people received unemployment benefits in October 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that represents a decline in the proportion of unemployed receiving the benefits. `` The average proportion of the unemployed receiving benefits during the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. `` In 1952, nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers were receiving benefits; by 1986, only 32 percent received benefits.'' Although several changes in the makeup of the workforce explain part of the decline, the report said 44 states took action to reduce eligibility. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said the drop in the number receiving benefits `` suggests a reduction in the system's effectiveness in stabilizing the economy _ and in mitigating the effects of income loss suffered by the unemployed.'' The report warns <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ease the current burden and help restore reserves or the country may see `` greater tax increases and larger benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the least favorable economic conditions.'' The Unemployment Insurance system was created in the 1930s as one of the New Deal programs passed in response to the Great Depression. It is run jointly by the federal government and the states, with each state managing separate trusts within the federal treasury and setting its own eligibility requirements and benefit levels. The system was designed to be self-sufficient, subsisting on federal taxes to finance administration and state taxes to fund benefits. But, said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, `` the system's long-standing presumption of self-financing has been eroding since the 1970s, when the government began making major loans to states otherwise unable to meet benefit commitments.'' `` Although only three state funds had ever received loans before 1972, during 1982-83 states needed loans of over $ 11.8 billion to pay benefits,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1986, state trusts owed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> a total of $ 4.8 billion, and federal laws have given them greater incentive to repay the loans _ and to trim their spending on benefits. The report stressed that the overall system is not insolvent. The system had $ 19.4 billion in reserve in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, enough to last about five months in a severe recession. But recent recessions have lasted 12 months, the report noted, and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommends each state have enough on hand to pay benefits for 18 months. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said those who qualify for benefits under state regulations will get them _ the federal government should cover any shortfall. Yet increased borrowing has been accompanied by an ominous decline in the percentage of people eligible for unemployment insurance. In 1969, 39 states had adequate reserves, the report said. But no more than two states have had adequate funds on hand in any year since 1976, the report said. At the same time, attempts to trim people from benefit rolls apparently have increased.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> warned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Monday that a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law could lead to more protectionism. The law `` could lead to greater recourse to unilateral measures by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which would be inconsistent with the <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION> declaration and with our common commitment to the multilateral trading system,'' the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers said in a statement. The 1986 declaration in <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, launched a new round of world trade talks designed to combat protectionism. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers said they will monitor implementation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law `` very closely'' and will take `` prompt action'' if <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> interests are threatened. EEC External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> told the ministers that the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law, by increasing trade powers for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would `` diminish the scope for discretion by the administration.'' He said it would `` open the door'' to lobbyists trying to influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to renege on its obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the set of regulations governing world trade. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> are locked in several trade disputes at the moment. These include <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> objections to the use of hormones in American beef and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to government subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, the European aircraft consortium. The ministers also repeated their objections to another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade initiative, a bill offering protection to manufacturers of textiles, clothing and footwear. `` Such a development would seriously affect trade in this sector and jeopardize the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round negotiations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers said in their statement. The bill would limit increases in textile and apparel imports to 1 percent a year over their 1987 levels and freeze non-rubber shoe imports at their 1987 level. Both the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have passed the bill, but by majorities insufficient to override a promised veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He has 10 days to sign it into law or, failing that, veto it.

 Soybean futures prices opened sharply lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by a number of bearish factors. Grain futures also opened lower. Soybeans for November delivery plunged more than 15 cents a bushel in early trading. Analysts said prices were driven lower by follow-through selling from Friday, weekend rains in major <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean regions and harvest pressure in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The opening was much weaker than anybody expected,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Midwestern corn and soybean growers had `` excellent harvesting weather over the weekend and real good conditions are expected for the next three days,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Soybean crops in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were much improved from a few weeks ago, although rain was still needed in northern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, he said. Wheat futures retreated on a lack of significant new export business, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.22 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.83 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 5 cents lower with December at $ 2.50 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 16 -RCB- cents lower with November at $ 8.17 a bushel Livestock futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but frozen pork belly futures were mixed. Live cattle were .28 cent to .53 cent higher with October at 70.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .55 cent higher with September at 79.75 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 39.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent lower to .88 cent higher with February at 51.70 cents a pound.

 The number of working oil and natural gas rigs dipped this week by four to total 917 as the resumption of rigs shut down by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was offset by sharp declines elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reports. The small, overall decline compares to last week's drop of 17 to total 921. The total reported Monday is the lowest since the count reached 894 on Aug. 1, and appears to reflect continuing softness in the crude market, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> economist <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerridge </PERSON> said Monday. The number of working rigs a year ago was 1,094. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> had 13 fewer working rigs, followed by <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, nine; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, five; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, four; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, three; and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, one. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was the biggest gainer for the week with an increase in eight working rigs, followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, seven; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, with five each; and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, one. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was unchanged for the week.

 Ministers from five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations adjourned an emergency price review session Monday without calling for a special meeting of the full cartel but urged all oil-producing nations to help stem the decline of world oil prices. The price monitoring panel, which tracks world oil trends and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member compliance with the organization's output policies, called for a joint meeting of the price committee and another <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> group, the <ORGANIZATION> Long-Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The joint meeting, which could be held in October, would review the objectives and strategies of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, the ministers said in a communique following the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, speaking to reporters, said that the ministers would decide following the joint session whether to call for a full gathering of the cartel before November. The ministers began meeting Sunday to review ways to harness a surge in production being blamed for forcing down international crude prices, an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> source said. The meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> began just after 11 a.m. at the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> embassy in the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> suburbs. The committee comprised of delegates from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was not expected to take any decisive action, the source said. The meeting was called after the recent slump in crude oil prices due largely to burgeoning oil production by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, analysts say. The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was producing 19 million barrels a day in August, far more than the 15.06 million barrel ceiling set by the cartel last June. In recent weeks world oil prices have fallen to their lowest level since the summer of 1986 when they dropped below $ 10 a barrel. World oil prices firmed slightly in the days leading up to the meeting as hopes escalated that the gathering might lead to a full meeting of the oil cartel and a restoration of quota discipline within the group. Although the committee, which monitors crude prices and member compliance with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> policies, has no enforcement powers, it can recommend an emergency meeting of all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member nations prior to the scheduled fall session set for Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON> was quoted as saying that falling oil prices would not deter <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from boosting its production. In an interview published Monday in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the Iraqi minister reiterated earlier statements that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would not adhere to its <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and instead was in the process of increasing oil output to 4.5 million barrels a day by 1991. The minister said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> needed to boost its oil revenue to rebuild its economy shattered during an eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, also are reported to be exceeding their quotas and competing for market share, leaving some analysts skeptical about the cartel's ability to reinstitute discipline among the organization's members. On Sunday, the price committee held a one-hour formal meeting at the same embassy in the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> suburbs and discussed a report on the current state of world oil prices and production, a senior delegate said. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> source said the meeting was likely to break for lunch Monday at 1 p.m. and then resume talks in the afternoon. The source also said Indonesian <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, who is also attending, may make a statement to reporters later Monday. He described the report as `` not very good.'' On Friday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brent </LOCATION> crude for October delivery dropped to $ 13.10 per barrel on rumors later proven false that Saudi Arabian Oil Minister <PERSON> Hishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> would not appear at the price committee meeting. By 12 p.m. Monday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent crude for October delivery had risen to $ 13.25 per barrel. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, whose minister hosted a dinner here Saturday for his committee colleagues, has complained to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other Gulf producers that failure to respect <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quotas is causing serious hardships for other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members whose economies are dependent on oil revenues. Besides Saudi oil minister <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, the others at the meeting include <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, who is also <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Belkacem </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new oil minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>.

 Share prices finished almost unchanged Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as a nervous market awaited Tuesday's key British trade report for August Some participants worried that another bad trade performance could leave the British government with no alternative but to push up interest rates. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 0.3 point, or 0.02 percent, higher at 1,792.7, below its best level for the day of 1,795.3 but stronger than its low of 1,789.4. Volume was a light 299.6 million shares, down sharply from the 396.5 million shares that changed hands Friday. The market remained lethargic as players awaited the British trade numbers. The report was considered especially important after last month's trade figures unhinged British markets with news of a deficit more than double what private economists had expected. For August, market expectations call for a narrowing of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current - account deficit to between 1.2 billion pounds and 1.7 billion pounds, or about $ 2 billion to $ 2.8 billion, from July's 2.15 billion pounds, or $ 3.6 billion Many market watchers said a poor trade number already has been discounted by the market, while a better-than-expected figure might send equities prices skyward.

<HEAD>IMF Urges Stronger Steps on Third World Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said Monday poor countries have been hurt by the recent rise in world interest rates and urged stronger steps to ease their staggering foreign debt burdens. The policy-making arm of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> also called on indebted countries to pursue policies that will spur growth and help `` restore domestic and foreign confidence.'' The panel, made up of the finance leaders of 22 countries, said banks should be encouraged to offer adequate refinancing to the debtor countries and not just stretch out their payments over longer periods. `` Many countries continue to face severe financing and adjustment difficulties, which have become more severe due to the recent increase in interest rates,'' said a statement from the group attending the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and its sister agency, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The financial organizations count 151 nations as members. `` More forceful actions are needed in the context of the current cooperative, case-by-case approach to resolve these difficulties,'' the statement said. The ministers also said governments should not bail out commercial banks which have made risky loans to poorer countries. `` There should be no official guarantees to private lenders,'' said Dutch Finance Minister <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruding </PERSON>, the panel chairman. Finance ministers from throughout the world began a round of talks last week in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF-World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which officially opens on Tuesday. Some 12,000 financial officials, bankers and journalists were expected to attend the sessions. The officials' talks have centered mostly on prospects for the world economy and the Third World debt. In its statement, the policy-making panel said, `` Growth in the industrial countries has heen stronger than expected, world trade has been buoyant, and inflation has been kept moderate.'' The group offered no new proposals for the debt problem and said it supported the current debt strategy. It took note of an offer from the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to make loans on easy terms to large debtor countries following IMF-backed economic policies. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' it said, `` intends to promote growth in developing countries and to contribute to the solution of the debt problem.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank governor, <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, was expected Tuesday to provide details of another debt plan, again to help the larger debtors, known as the `` middle-income'' countries. This proposal, first discussed in June at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic summit of key industrialized nations, calls for the debtors to deposit some of their international reserves with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. The finance leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and six other major industrial nations over the weekend gave their final approval to a plan to help the very poor countries, mostly in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But the big debtors, like <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, also would like some special assistance in reducing the debt burdens that have slowed their economic development. The two countries, the developing world's largest debtors, have debts totaling more than $ 220 billion. In recent years, the industrial nations have followed what they call a case-by-case approach to the debt, an approach that calls for dealing individually with the debtors. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has been instrumental in fashioning financial rescue packages for heavily indebted countries. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> provides assistance to these countries for economic development.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee ended a two-day emergency session Monday by calling for prompt action to reverse the sharp decline in world oil prices but stopped short of calling for a special meeting of the full 13-member cartel. In a communique released at the conclusion of the meeting, the oil ministers also said it was essential that a joint meeting of the price committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Long-Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> be held to review existing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> strategies and objectives. `` No lasting stability in the world oil market can be achieved without concrete cooperation by the non-OPEC oil producing countries and their contribution in regulating world supplies of oil in line with demand,'' the price committee said. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, speaking to reporters at a news conference following the meeting, underscored the committee's statement saying the cause of the recent fall in oil prices was `` mainly due to a significant overproduction of some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries as well as non-OPEC oil producers.'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said the ministers would decide after the joint meeting whether a special session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should be called before its regularly scheduled meeting Nov. 21 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Oil futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which had risen earlier in the day, began falling immediately after <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s statements then recovered slightly, analysts said. One broker said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s comments were interpreted as indicating <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was unwilling to take immediate action to restrain oil output and boost sagging oil prices. The meeting of the price committee was called in response to the recent slump in world oil prices, which earlier this month hit their lowest level since the summer of 1986 when they fell below $ 10 a barrel. According to many analysts, sagging prices represent the failure of nearly all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to respect production quotas. The secretary general did not give specific dates for the joint meeting except to say it would probably be held in October. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are to speak directly with each other at the Long-Term Strategy Committee for the first time in years within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. He downplayed the significance of such a meeting, however, saying it was normal that their respective oil ministers should speak since their foreign ministers began meeting last month in peace talks. The <ORGANIZATION> Long-Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is comprised of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s founding members, including: <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have both confirmed their attendance at the joint session. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> also are members of the price committee, along with <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Since the last price committee meeting Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, a cease-fire between the two countries in their eight-year Gulf War has begun to hold. The Price Evolution Committee, as the price committee is officially named, is an influential panel that studies price developments and compliance with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> policies, namely production quotas, by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, although it has no enforcement powers. The committee may, however, call for special meetings of all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. The committee said it also examined during the emergency session in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> capital a report prepared by the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretariat on current market conditions as well as a report presented by <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> on the outcome of his recent visits to various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil producing countries. The Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at 19 million barrels a day in August and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> has put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at closer to 20 million barrels per day. Last June, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling to apply to all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations except <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has refused to go along with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quotas, saying it needs to produce more oil to rebuild its war-torn economy following eight years of fighting with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Monday, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brent </LOCATION> crude for delivery in October was quoted at $ 13.25, up slightly from Friday.

<HEAD>Harvest Pressures Soybean Futures To 16-Week Low</HEAD>

 Soybean futures prices plunged Monday to their lowest close in nearly four months on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the accelerating harvest brought new supplies to the market. Grain futures also finished lower with oats for December and March delivery closing down the allowable limit of 10 cents a bushel.

That was the lowest closing price for soybean futures since June 1, when soybeans for July delivery finished at $ 8.01 -RCB- a bushel. Fine harvesting weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend and rains in major soybean-growing areas of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> prompted heavy selling, analysts said. `` The market's very much on the defensive with the harvest going on,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Securities Industry Group President Offers Dismal Post-Crash
Review</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Crash-Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's leading securities industry group offered a bleak assessment Monday of the year since the stock crash and predicted individual investors will shun the market until they see major reforms. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that although the worst fears about the economy never materialized after the Oct. 19 collapse and market conditions have improved in some areas, `` the overall current environment is at best gray.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>, the main trade group of Wall Street, `` believes the near-term outlook is n't likely to improve substantially until full investor confidence is restored in both the integrity of the marketplace and the strength of the economy.'' In the longer term, he said, `` lackluster equities prices will make it more difficult for companies to raise equity funds at the very time capital needs and reconstruction of industry are necessary to effectively compete in the world market for goods and services.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s remarks were part of what the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> called his overview of events since the crash, which erased 508 points from the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average and has continued to undermine the health of the securities industry. Quoting what he called currently available data, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said the dollar amount of common stock offerings fell 37.5 percent in the first half of 1988 vs. the same time a year earlier. The drop would have been sharper without the inclusion of offerings in special investment companies called closed-end funds. Although prices of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues have partly recovered from post-crash lows, they averaged only $ 32.80 through August 1988, well below $ 44 in September 1987, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> through July remained 8 percent off the 1987 average, and the drop would have been even sharper without inclusion of volume-inflating strategies in which stocks are traded to capture quarterly dividends, he said. Largely as a result of these conditions, layoffs and furloughs in the business totaled 16,000 nationwide through the first quarter, he said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said there have been a few steps to correct problems exposed as a result of the crash, `` but major regulatory reform has n't taken place.'' As an example, he said no concerted effort has emerged to place financial markets under one regulator, a key recommendation of a presidential commission that examined the crash. He also said the markets themselves have so far failed to agree on common ways to stop or slow the impact of another panic. `` Failure to have these and other systems in place contributed to the October 19 freefall; and until they are rectified, the individual investor is likely to continue to be wary of the marketplace,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> concluded.

 The stock market declined slightly in a slow session today, weighed down by rising interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds fell in the credit markets, putting their yields in the 9.07 percent-9 .15 percent range Analysts noted that the market continues to be stalled in a narrow trading range and that activity is dominated by `` deal'' stocks. In addition, brokers said there is some concern among investors that economic statistics for September, although not due to be released for several weeks, will show that the economy has been reheating.

<HEAD>Time Magazine Making Some Changes in Design</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is changing the layout of its flagship magazine to make it easier to read, but an editor says the changes are minor and most readers may not even notice. The changes will include the expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s one-page index to two pages, introduction of new `` Travel'' and `` Interview'' sections and use of bigger and more informative headlines and photo captions, executives said Monday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, assistant managing editor of Time magazine, said the changes represent `` a tuning up and modification of our 1977 redesign'' that signalled the regular use of color photographs in the magazine. He said some of the changes, such as longer headlines and captions, have been used on occasion over the past few months. But he said all of the changes become magazine policy starting with the Oct. 17 issue, which will appear on newstands starting Oct. 10. Managing Editor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> was in private meetings all day Monday, outlining the changes to Time's bureau chiefs and editors who were not involved with the changes, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. The company has called its ad salesmen and managers in for a similar meeting on Tuesday. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the changes reflect a response to the increasing demands on readers' time and attention. `` The key is to increase the accessibility of the story to the reader,'' he said. `` We're helping them grab the essence of the story.'' Along with bigger headlines and longer captions, he said, the magazine will make more extensive use of taking quotes from a story and putting them in a box to draw more attention to the story. He said he did not know if the average reader would have noticed the changes if the magazine did not call attention to them. The new `` Travel'' section will carry stories about issues such as fare wars as well destinations, while the `` Interview'' section will use a question-and-answer format, alternating with the `` Profile'' section, he said. The magazine also will offer an `` American Ideas'' section, alternating with its `` American Scene'' section and focusing on people and how they succeeed or fail at bringing off their ideas. Time is the largest of the weekly newsmagazines, with a circulation of 4.6 million, unchanged from a year ago. For the first eight months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s ad pages rose 2.5 percent to 1,487.32 from a year ago while its ad revnue rose 3.6 percent to $ 205 million, according to a survey by <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> for the research firm <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, saw its ad pages fall 4.6 percent to 1,467.97 in the first eight months, and its ad revenue slip 1.8 percent to $ 140 million, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report had a 12.2 percent increase in ad pages to 1,090.72, while its ad revenue rose 20.2 percent to $ 73.4 million.

 The dollar shook off central bank selling and closed mostly higher Monday, reflecting traders' optimism that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would remain strong. Gold prices rose in domestic trading after falling overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 395 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 1.25 from late Friday's bid of $ 393.75. At a weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, finance ministers of the seven industrial nations known as the Group of Seven reaffirmed their intention to keep currency rates stable. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the meeting did not seem to influence the dollar's direction Monday Investors were reacting to positive factors including a recent narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and the conservative attitude of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> toward interest rates, <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said. `` The pressure is for the dollar to stay at these levels or go higher,'' he said. The central banks of several nations entered foreign-exchange markets to stem the dollar's rise, but the currency still chalked up a gain. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> all intervened to sell dollars, dealers said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.26 Japanese yen to a closing 134.73 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.70 yen, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ended the day by rising to 134.535 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from late Friday's 134.325. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6668 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6715 late Friday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, however, the pound edged up against the dollar, closing at $ 1.6720, up from $ 1.6715 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8817 West German marks, up from 1.8735; 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5827; 6.4035 French francs, up from 6.3870; 1,401.37 Italian lire, up from 1,399.00; and 1.2195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2223 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.8835 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.5935 Swiss francs, up from 1.5850; 6.5000 French francs, up from 6.3888; 2.1230 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140; 1.403.50 Italian lire, up from 1,400.50; 1.2211 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2220 Gold prices steadied in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday after plunging through the $ 400 mark last week. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a troy ounce of gold closed at $ 395.10, up from $ 394.20 late Friday. In overseas trading, gold prices fell, but traders predicted there would be demand for the metal in coming days. `` We've seen the worst, at least for the time being,'' said one bullion dealer in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Gold fell in earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading to a late bid price of $ 394.50 a troy ounce, down from late Friday's $ 396.50, and also declined in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 392, down from $ 398 late Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it lost $ 9 million in the final quarter of its fiscal year but managed to post a profit for the 12-month period. The shortfall still was an improvement over the year-ago quarter, when the retailer reported a loss of $ 188.8 million. Sales during the quarter ended July 30 totaled $ 594.5 million, virtually unchanged from a year earlier. For the full year, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> reported a profit of $ 17.7 million, a dramatic turnaround from a $ 178.7 million loss in the previous year when the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> unit was spun off to fight a takeover attempt. The company reported sales in the 1988 fiscal year of $ 2.6 billion, compared with 1987 sales of $ 2.9 billion. The 1988 results include one-time gains of $ 30 million on the sale of a shopping center and $ 10.1 million from an accounting change. Those gains were partly offset by one-time charges totaling $ 30.3 million for changes to operations and early payment of debt.

<HEAD>Partial Settlement Reported Near in Boesky-Related Civil Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A partial settlement is close in a class-action lawsuit between one of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s companies and investors who claim they were defrauded by the imprisoned speculator's insider trading, lawyers said Monday. Key details were not disclosed, but the lawyers said it would cause a realignment in the morass of civil suits and countersuits that have enveloped <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> since he paid the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million nearly two years ago in penalties and illicit trading profits. `` We've got it virtually done,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, lead co-counsel of a group of shareholders who sued <ORGANIZATION> Ivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boesky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment vehicle once controlled by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The settlement would remove as defendants in the class-action suit the limited partners in <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s investment company, who themselves have sued <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> on grounds he defrauded them. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> would remain a defendant in the class-action suit, as would <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street firm he has implicated in a number of allegedly fraudulent deals. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was accused by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month of extensive securities law violations but has denied the charges. It remains unclear what impact, if any, the partial settlement disclosed Monday would have on the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> litigation. <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> declined to comment on reports that the partial settlement could involve between $ 30 million and $ 50 million in compensation payments to his clients. `` I've been working for one and a half years to get this settlement, and do n't want to see premature publicity,'' he said. Others however, speaking on condition they not be identified, said the compensation element of the settlement remains unresolved and would involve petitioning the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which will use part of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s surrendered money to repay others who can prove they were victimized. In addition, these lawyers said, <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>'s clients would need the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where all of the Boesky-related civil litigation has been filed. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, which has been drafting a plan for how to compensate <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s victims, is scheduled to complete it by Oct. 3. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment Monday on whether plaintiffs in the class-action suit against <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> would be part of that plan. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and the entities he once controlled were inundated with lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his insider trading activities in November 1986. Most of the suits were by shareholders who were selling stock at the time <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and his associates were buying. The speculator began serving a three-year federal prison term last March after he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Automakers have learned from defense and aerospace programs how to develop coordinated systems rather than sticking with component-oriented piecemeal design approaches, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Monday echnologies, integrating them into new products and bringing the whole package to market more quickly than anyone else,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Tadashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kume </PERSON> gave keynote speeches at the opening of a four-day conference of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, another keynote speaker, was unable to attend, but his prepared remarks were read by <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> started its Project Trilby electronics and computer-oriented engineering effort years ago to answer the question, `` What would an automobile be like if, instead of the old add-on approach, we started to design it today, with all of the ... systems know-how and microprocessor technology that we have at our disposal?'' Resulting coordinated, systems-engineering methods are now moving into mainstream auto design at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said those approaches are vital, not only for quicker reaction to the market but to coordinate design of advanced technology items such as active suspensions, automated braking systems and traction control. <PERSON> Kume </PERSON> talked about his company's growth as an international auto manufacturing power, and his resulting efforts to shake off complacency in the ranks. <PERSON> Kume </PERSON> said he sometimes keeps his executives on their toes by transferring them to new positions for which they have no apparent background. `` Sometimes I do that by challenging the organization to meet seemingly impossible goals,'' he said. `` The larger an organization becomes ... the more bureaucratic it becomes. Persons become contented with a standard way of doing things. No chances are taken. No mistakes are made,'' he said. Spreading into worldwide markets also helps avoid those tendencies, <PERSON> Kume </PERSON> said. `` Internationalization of our company is causing it to become more flexible, and from this flexibility comes more creativity,'' he said. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> estimated in his remarks that 25 million to 30 million people worldwide work in auto-related jobs. But he predicted a 50 percent drop in auto industry employment by 1992. Increased use of outside suppliers, fewer supervisors as production workers assume more responsibility, and fewer white collar workers as computers are used for more tasks will contribute to the decline, <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said in the remarks delivered by <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>. Nearly 200 technical presentations are slated during the conference, which continues through Thursday, on topics such as vehicle handling, composite materials, suspension systems, vehicle safety, power train design and electronic controls. The international gathering of 22 automotive engineering societies is hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Soybean futures prices plunged Monday to their lowest close in nearly four months on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the accelerating harvest brought new supplies to the market. Grain futures also finished lower with oats for December and March delivery closing down the allowable limit of 10 cents a bushel. On other markets, sugar and cocoa futures were sharply lower; livestock and meat futures were sharply higher; energy futures rose; precious metals were mixed and stock-index futures weakened. Soybeans for delivery in November plummeted more than 26 cents to settle at $ 8.06 \ a bushel, the lowest settlement price for soybean futures since June 1, when the July contract finished at $ 8.01 -RCB- a bushel On Aug. 24, soybeans for September delivery fell to $ 8 a bushel in intra-day trading but settled that day at $ 8.31 -LCB-. Fine harvesting weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and rains in major soybean-growing areas of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> prompted heavy selling, analysts said. `` The market's very much on the defensive with the harvest going on,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the harvest pressure, a dearth of significant export orders has limited buying interest in soybean futures, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Demand is eventually going to drive us higher, of course, but ... the longer we wait before we see some demand, the lower we're going to go,'' she said Harvest pressure also weighed on the corn market while wheat prices fell on a lack of significant new export business, analysts said. Wheat settled 3 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.22 \ a bushel; corn was 3 \ cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.80 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 10 cents lower with December at $ 2.44 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 12 -LCB- cents to 28 -RCB- cents lower with November at $ 8.06 Sugar futures prices fell dramatically on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a sell-off triggered by the sharp drop in soybean futures, analysts said. Prices for March through October 1989 delivery skidded the 0.5-cent-a-pound daily limit while most contracts for nearer-term delivery, which are not subject to the limit, fell even further. Sugar for delivery this October settled 0.5 cent lower at $ 9.49 a pound. Cocoa futures declined steeply in a continuing reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s failure earlier this month to devise a means of supporting prices. Prices are at 13-year lows and cocoa `` looks like a terminally ill market with no cure in sight,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Cocoa for December delivery settled $ 45 lower at $ 1,124 a metric ton. Unexpectedly strong packer demand for hogs and fattened cattle helped push some livestock futures up the 1.50-cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. The pork market was especially strong, based on expectations that Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hogs-and-pigs report will show that some producers abandoned expansion plans this year because of the drought-driven increase in feed-grain costs, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .65 cent to 1.50 cents higher with October at 70.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.50 cents higher with September at 80.17 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to 1.50 cents higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 52.10 cents a pound Gold futures rose slightly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange while silver posted solid declines. Gold settled 30 cents to $ 1 higher with October at $ 495.80 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.5 cents lower with September at $ 6.107 a troy ounce. Energy futures ended slightly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a volatile session that calmed on news that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing committee had adjourned their weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, with plans to meet again with the cartel's long-term strategy committee The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking a solution to the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction that has been blamed for persistent weakness of crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher with November at $ 14.20 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to .20 cent lower with October at 40.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .31 cent higher with October at 45.25 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .30 point lower at 271.95.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would sell stores and food processing plants and reduce its work force as part of a $ 4.6 billion restructuring aimed at defeating two takeover bids. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> officials contended the restructuring would be more lucrative for shareholders than a $ 4.6 billion bid by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or a competing $ 4.32 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Late Friday, when <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> announced that its board had approved the restructuring, the company also said it had rejected both offers as inadequate Spokesmen for <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> declined comment Monday. The restructuring, which must be approved by shareholders, is worth $ 57 to $ 61 per share, or as much as $ 4.6 billion, officials said. The plan, first publicly proposed on Sept. 13, would pay shareholders $ 40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at $ 8 and publicly-traded stock worth between $ 5 and $ 10. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has 78.6 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, a retailing company which has made a number of unsuccessful takeover bids in recent years, offered last Monday to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for $ 55 per share _ $ 43 in cash and securities valued at $ 12 _ or about $ 4.32 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, which has outbid <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> for three other corporations in recent years, entered the bidding last Tuesday by offering to buy <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for $ 58.50 per share _ $ 50 in cash and $ 8.50 in securities, or a total of $ 4.6 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s adviser, told company officials the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offer raised antitrust issues because the investment firm recently acquired two other grocery retailers, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 62 -LCB- cents to close at $ 56.37 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday Company officials said at a news conference they expected the asset sales to raise an estimated $ 333 million after taxes. The restructuring would make the company smaller and increase its debt load, but leave it economically viable and competitive, Chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> declined to reveal how many employees would be laid off. The jobs would be eliminated at the grocery retailer's <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters, he said <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell some of its food processing facilities; its 27-store Fry's division in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; its <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> superwarehouse venture in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and 29 supermarkets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The company also said it would sell its 16-unit <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to a management-led investment group, and proceed with the sale of its <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> division, which comprises 43 supermarkets and 39 liquor stores. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> also announced plans to sell and then lease back stores and real estate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and sell its general merchandise distribution center in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The retailer said it had commitments for $ 3.6 billion in financing for the restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1883 by shopkeeper <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroger </PERSON>, operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes a variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to outside customers. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> won a hostile takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, in which the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family was a bidder, and outbid the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the auto parts retailer <ORGANIZATION> Trak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>SmithKline Restructuring Expected At Tuesday Board Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Announcement of a major restructuring at <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose profits have declined, could come after a board meeting of the pharmaceutical company expected to take place Wednesday. The firm announced in July it planned to cut costs and become more efficient by restructuring its corporate staff. The firm has refused to divulge details of the restructuring. Analysts and development officials who have spoken to <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> executives believe the shakeup could lead to layoffs of as many as 3,000 worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said as many as 2,000 of <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s employees could be laid off, but cautioned that `` the restructuring may be more far-reaching than that.'' Analysts have said they expect the board meeting Wednesday, but <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm the date. `` We just ca n't comment on anything right at the moment,'' a spokesman said last week. `` We have announced that we are studying the restructuring of the pharmaceutical business and corporate staff, and work is continuing, but we ca n't say anything fruther at this time.'' The company said in July that it would reorganize its business following a lackluster first-half performance in which earnings dropped by 25 percent. The company also predicted that earnings for the full 1988 fiscal year would be off by 25 percent as well. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> blamed the drop in its profits on the disappointing sales of its two top drugs _ Tagamet, an anti-ulcer drug, and Dyazide, a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.

<HEAD>KKR Said To Face Deadline for Amending Macmillan Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investment group aligned with <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> management said Monday it was considering amending its $ 2.36 billion buyout bid for the publishing concern, but a deadline passed without an announcement. The British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has made a competing offer of $ 2.41 billion in cash for all of the company's stock, but <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s board has taken no position on it and said it wanted `` to continue the auction process.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> appeared to be moving toward a resolution of the takeover contest that began in mid-May. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> had advised it Friday that the bidding process was `` drawing to a close'' and requested that if <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> planned to amend its bid, it should advise the company by 5:30 p.m. Monday. As the deadline passed, spokesmen for the company were unavailable for comment. The Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said, however, that a source close to <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said its board was scheduled to meet Tuesday before the stock market opened. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 87.25, which was slightly higher than <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s bid of $ 86.80 a share.

 Scores of leftist militants fought running battles with truncheon-swinging riot police Monday night during protests against world financial discussions, witnesses said. Several rioters were hauled away in police vans, and paramedics said some protesters and police officers were injured. No figures were given on the injuries. The incidents were the first serious clashes between demonstrators and police since World Bank-International Monetary Fund talks began in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last Thursday. Militants threw stones at the windows of downtown stores, banks and cars. They dragged a small car from its parking place and used it to block Kurfuerstendamm, the city's main boulevard. Police moved in with truncheons, and smashed camera equipment of photographers taking pictures of the violence, reporters at the scene said. The street was cleared. Some reports said that at one point Bavarian state police officers used their truncheons to beat plainclothes <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police. About 2,700 police from across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been transported to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to help the city's 6,000-strong force during the financial talks. The violence broke out after about 500 radicals blocked streets leading to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, where hundreds of people were watching a production of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Magic Flute'' staged especially for delegates and guests of the talks, witnesses said. Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused to budge, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police threw a tear-gas grenade as protesters fled down a street, they said. About 100 of the demonstrators ran to a square near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where they again fought police, then fled once more, according to the witnesses. Other protesters fought with police on a nearby square and at other sites downtown, said the reporters. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people held a mostly peaceful march in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to protest what they called unfair financial policies by industrialized nations toward heavily indebted Third World lands. Several peaceful demonstrations were held earlier Monday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> hurt its independent bottlers when it changed its syrup formula and did not pass on the savings, a bottler testified Monday as trial began in a federal court suit against the soft-drink manufacturer. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial, which is expected to take five months, involves 24 independent bottlers seeking to have the court uphold a 1921 pact tying the price they pay for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> syrup to the cost of sugar. If successful, the bottlers could realize up to $ 35 million in damages. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elizabethtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who filed the lawsuit, testified that <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> began substituting high-fructose corn syrup for sucrose as a sweetener in 1980 without passing the savings on to bottlers. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, whose grandfather established the fifth <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> bottling plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the changes made it difficult for him to compete with other major brands, such as <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION>. `` The company said they'd go to a 50-50 sugar-fructose syrup,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> testified. `` The problem was if <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> went to fructose, the cost decreases. Unless the decreased cost is passed on to the bottler then competitors would also add fructose and be able to charge less.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vehko </PERSON>, an attorney who argued for the bottlers, alleged during opening arguments Monday that Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> `` broke its promise'' to use sugar as a sweetener, and when it changed to a cheaper sweetener refused to pass the savings on the bottlers. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, argued the bottlers are not entitled to any monetary relief. `` The bottlers never contended they had a veto right'' to a change in ingredients in the syrup under the 1921 pact, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. He said in 1971 and 1974, <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> changed the caffeine content in its product without consulting the bottlers, and there were no complaints from the bottlers. `` It's absurd to think -LRB- any bottler -RRB- would have the power to veto a sweetener change,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

The incidents were the first serious clashes between demonstrators and police since <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and International Monetary Fund annual meetings began in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Thursday. Militants threw stones at the windows of downtown stores, banks and cars. They dragged a small car from its parking place and used it to block Kurfuerstendamm, the city's main boulevard. Police moved in with truncheons, and smashed camera equipment of photographers taking pictures of the violence, reporters at the scene said. The street was cleared. Witnesses said at one point Bavarian state police officers used truncheons to beat a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police officer. About 2,700 police from across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been transported to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to help the city's 6,000-strong force during the financial talks. The violence broke out after about 500 radicals blocked streets leading to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, where hundreds of people were watching a production of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Magic Flute'' staged especially for delegates and guests of the talks, witnesses said. Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused to budge, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police threw a tear-gas grenade as protesters fled down a street, they said. About 100 of the demonstrators ran to a square near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where they again fought police, then fled once more, according to the witnesses. Other protesters fought with police on a nearby square and at other sites downtown, said the reporters. On Sunday, tens of thousands of people held a mostly peaceful march in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to protest what they called unfair financial policies by industrialized nations toward heavily indebted Third World countries. Several peaceful demonstrations were held earlier Monday.
