<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday disavowed a congressional candidate who it said failed to respond to allegations in a lawsuit that he distributed posters connecting an airline with AIDS. The executive committee of the state party voted 33-1 to deny <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> the use of the name Democrat in his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign. `` The party needed to deal with this openly. Do n't flinch, do n't blush, just do business, and I think that's what we've done here,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of distributing anonymous posters with such messages as `` AIDS is Spread Through <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>: Travel With AIDS.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit, which seeks $ 500,000 in damages, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> sent a poster to the airline's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> offices in July saying: `` Thousands of these have been sent around the country. Our staff is working on a new poster. They will continue to be sent until <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> corrects the hurt you have caused-cost me.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s squabble with <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> apparently began in 1983 when he took the airline to small claims court in two separate cases to recover `` frequent flyer'' benefits he felt he deserved. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> won one case and lost another. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> did not attend Sunday's meeting. State party leaders said he has not made himself available to talk with them about the matter since the lawsuit was filed Sept. 19 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The 53-year-old teacher and Realtor from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> reportedly has denied the charges made by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. He did not respond to messages, including one Sunday night, left by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on his home phone answering machine. In his first foray into politics, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was unopposed for the Democratic nomination to run against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefley </PERSON> in the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which encompasses <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. The district <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> committee met first Sunday and issued a complaint saying <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s failure to respond to the controversy surrounding the lawsuit has hurt the campaigns of other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates in the district. `` I can verify that it is hurting my candidacy. People ask me, ` What craziness are you going to come up with?','' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who is running against an incumbent Republican for a legislative seat in the district. The party's vote Sunday wo n't affect the ballot, which already has been printed. But the party said it would publish the disavowal in newspapers. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Daily </PERSON>, the party's attorney, stressed that the party was n't making a judgment on <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations against <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, but was moving against him only `` because of Mr. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s failure to act like a responsible candidate and step forward and deal with those issues. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> a `` walk-on candidate'' and said he was nominated `` with the best of intentions.'' `` He was a Realtor, an educator and seemed like a nice guy,'' the party chairman said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> teaches communications at <ORGANIZATION> Pikes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

 Next time, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> probably wo n't wait till the last minute to vote The Democratic candidate for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> arrived too late at the polls, and lost the election by one vote. A recount last week showed that <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> lost the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 15 election. The recount showed <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> with 14,715 votes. His opponent got 14,716. The 67-year-old car dealer said he had been campaigning on election day, `` and I waited until the last minute to race over'' to vote. The result `` gives new meaning to the phrase ` one-man, one-vote,''' said <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, a member of the council since 1969, is protesting the election, claiming that some ballots are missing and others are invalid. The eight-member Governor's Council, which dates from the Colonial era, lost many of its powers in the 1960s. Its chief remaining duties are to approve criminal pardons and confirm judges nominated by the governor. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said he would go to court today to request that the primary be invalidated and a special election be held to decide the nomination. The lawyer also suggested the close vote might have had something to do with the last name of <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>'s opponent, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Also on the ballot were Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, both D-Mass. Although <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Councilor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is not a member of the famous <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> political clan, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said, he may have benefited from uncertainty on that point. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> opposes another election. `` All another election would do at this point would be to give my opponent an opportunity to vote,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expressed hope for improved relations and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European nations offered effusive congratulations on Saturday after sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership left <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> holding the nation's top two jobs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, already the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary, took over the goverment presidency Saturday from <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who retired after a 50-year career that started under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed expanding the powers of the largely ceremonial presidency, along with slashing the massive party apparatus.

The countries have never formally resolved their World War II antagonism because of competing claims on a group of islands in the Kurile chain that Soviet troops have occupied since the closing days of the war. There was no immediate response from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials. East European leaders were quick to shower <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with congratulatory telegrams Saturday.

 Firefighters had all but doused a fire that once threatened 30 luxury homes, thanks to a favorable wind shift and residents who had already cleared away dry brush, officials said Saturday. `` The Diamond Bar fire is fully under control and we've returned all our units to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> firefighter <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Westbuy </PERSON> said early Saturday. He said a few local firefighters remained, putting out the blaze's remaining hot spots. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> officials reported they were gaining the upper hand against a brush fire 25 miles away in the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cucamonga </LOCATION> area that had burned 10,665 acres and destroyed one house since it was ignited Wednesday. Fire officials said that blaze was a result of arson, one of 30 set recently in the <LOCATION> Lytle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It was declared 75 percent contained Saturday, and officials estimated it damaged property worth about $ 375,000. The fire at <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, which burned 300 acres, came within a few yards of 30 expensive ridgeline homes in the Tonner Canyon area, forcing the evacuation of about 120 residents. All had been allowed to return Saturday. Authorities said the blaze, which started Friday, was of suspicious origin. `` It was a matter of expert firefighting and the wind shifting in our favor, `` <PERSON> Westbuy </PERSON> said. `` We got a big break from the wind.'' He said firefighters were also aided by residents who had adhered to an aggressive program mandated by the Fire Department to clear dry brush from around homes each year. Approximately 120 firefighters battled the blaze in 90-degree weather Friday. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralez </PERSON>, who was riding a horse in Tonner Canyon when the fire broke out, said it turned into an inferno in a matter of seconds. `` Within 60 seconds, the brush and trees just went up,'' she said. `` I looked over my shoulder, and there was a big wall of flames.'' County Battalion Chief <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said the fire, in an area about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was being investigated. In <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cucamonga </LOCATION>, about 55 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 1,155 firefighters battled the so-called <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> fire, which started Wednesday, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. The fire destroyed one home earlier in the week, but no houses were threatened Saturday and the blaze was 75 percent contained, <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said. High temperatures and erratic wind that gusted up to 60 mph early in the week made fighting the blaze difficult, but the weather had eased by Saturday, <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Peru Price Rise Highest Ever, Economic Analysts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer prices rose 117.9 percent during September, a respected economics analysis firm said Saturday. It is by far the largest monthly inflation increase in Peruvian history. The dramatic rise pushed inflation from January through September to 754 percent, according to the report by <PERSON> Apoyo </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said its inflation figures, which were due for release Friday, had been delayed until early this week. Apoyo's figures, which have in the past reflected the government's official report, showed the categories of books, transportation and food had the highest price gains during September, registering 180 percent, 177 percent and 120 percent, respectively. According to government figures, the highest single month price rise since figures were kept in 1922 previously occurred in July, registering 30.9 percent. The previous highest yearly mark was 158.3 percent set in 1985. The sharp cost of living increase was anticipated after the government early in September devalued currency 86 percent and allowed prices for food, gasoline and other goods to rise as high as 200 percent in an effort to control runaway inflation, which is still expected to reach 900 percent this year. The government said the austerity plan, aimed at eliminating costly government subsidies, will begin to show results this month and cut inflation to near zero by early next year. Independent analysts said the chief causes of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s record inflation are a government deficit estimated at more than 12 percent of the gross national product, dwindling production coupled with hot consumer demand, and a widening trade imbalance.

<HEAD>Inflation Tops 200 Percent For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Annual inflation in this crisis-ridden communist nation topped 200 percent for the first time last month, the federal statistics bureau announced Saturday. September inflation was 217 percent over the same month last year, with a 15.4 percent increase over August, the bureau said. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav government, in an effort to contain runaway inflation and growing labor unrest, demanded cancellation of planned sharp price hikes of electricity, rents, rail and postal services, press reported Saturday. The last minute government appeal came after the state-run electrical company announced a 31 percent price hike of electricity, due to take effect Saturday. Also as of Oct. 1, postal services in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> were to go up by 10.5 percent, rents by 36 percent, and rail transport by 36.7 percent for passengers and 46.7 for cargo. The government communique, published in the official press, said such sharp price hikes `` are unjustified at the time of the country's very difficult social and economic situation.'' The price increases would boost the country's rampant inflation and lead to a further drop in living standards of Yugoslavs, the government said, adding that the companies should reconsider the planned hikes by Oct. 4. The statistics bureau said that since December of last year, inflation measured 129.5 percent. Prices of electricity, rail transport and postal services already were considerably boosted in July. Workers have staged several protest marches in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> following the introduction in May of a government austerity program which allowed substantial price hikes and hefty wage cuts. The steps are designed eventually to curb <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest inflation rate and repay <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s $ 21 billion foreign debt by introducing a more market-oriented economy.

<TEXT>
 The government cut the value of its currency by 77 percent and nearly doubled the price of gasoline Saturday in another round of measures aimed at shoring up the battered economy. The official exchange rate for the national currency, the cordoba, went from 180 to the dollar to 320 to the dollar and gasoline rose from the equivalent of $ 1.02 a gallon to $ 2.03 a gallon. The leftist government also said state workers will immediately get a 35-percent raise. Planning Minister <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuenca </PERSON> said the devaluation is designed to `` establish a realistic relationship between prices in the domestic and international markets,'' according to the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party, <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON>. The government blames the 8-year-old war with the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, for its economic woes which include rampant inflation, serious shortages of food, fuel and other basics and a shrinking economy. It was the fourth round of adjustments this year. In the previous round a month ago, gas prices rose from the equivalent of 46 cents a gallon to $ 1.02. The cordoba went from 80 to the dollar to 180. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> described the economic steps last month as a matter of `` survival'' until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is at peace. In the government-controlled exchange market restricted to a handful of transactions such as those involving medical supplies, the cordoba now trades at 485 to the dollar. The Sandinista government began making economic adjustments in February, when inflation was said officially to be at 1,300 percent. The new currency, then valued at 10 to the dollar, was issued. A series of devaluations and gasoline price hikes have followed. In June, many wage and price controls were lifted.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should make completion of a treaty on long-range nuclear weapons conditional on Soviet concessions on conventional arms, a position that differs from that of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. In an interview reported in the newspaper's Sunday editions, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was worried the Soviets would not negotiate seriously on cutting conventional weapons if the two superpowers reach a prior agreement in their strategic arms reduction talks. `` If we negotiate on START, what leverage do we have on conventional,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Times. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rejected the idea of linking talks on strategic nuclear arms with talks on conventional arms, saying it would delay completion of a strategic arms treaty. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has endorsed that position. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in the interview he would follow administration policy if he became vice president. `` The view of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is that we are going to proceed with START, and we want to talk about conventional arms control,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` But there has not been the linkage that I discussed.'' If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected President, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said top officials `` will sit down and discuss what the strategy is going to be'' on nuclear and conventional arms issues. `` And the strategy, as far as the connecting of these, you've got to wait until you get into the administration for some of those very important subtle issues. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had not previously revealed these positions in the campaign, the Times said.

 About 45 people were trapped upside down and had to be removed by aerial ladder after the Super Loops ride at the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> became stuck in the middle of a loop Saturday night, authorities said.

<HEAD>Japanese Emperor Receives Another Transfusion; Blood Pressure
Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received another transfusion Sunday, as his internal bleeding continued and his blood pressure rose to equal its highest reading since his condition deteriorated two weeks ago. But palace officials said the 87-year-old monarch stabilized after a crisis Saturday, when he suddenly discharged a large amount of blood and his blood pressure dropped precariously for about 30 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the imperial family's affairs, said the emperor was given a 0.4-pint transfusion Sunday morning. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> discharged a small amount of blood from his bowels twice, it said. The transfusion brought to 10.2 pints the total amount of blood he received since internal hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood Sept. 19. That amount is considerably larger than the total volume normally in the emperor's body, news reports said. Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Crown Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> visited the emperor and exchanged words for a short time Sunday morning, along with <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, who was summoned back from studies in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Two other op nirograndchildren visited later, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. At midafternoon, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature was 99 degrees, compared with his normal reading of about 95.9, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. His blood pressure was 168 over 76, matching the highest reported level since his condition worsened. Sunday morning it had been 135 over 70, the imperial agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the emperor's normal pressure was not immediately available, but a typical normal reading is about 120 over 80. High blood pressure can pose a strain on the heart and worsen internal bleeding. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said it was unclear how much blood the emperor lost Saturday, but news reports said it could have been as much as 2.1 pints. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s vital signs stabilized later Saturday after he was given two emergency transfusions totaling 1.7 pints. Doctors have expressed concern that the volume of transfusions needed to compensate for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s internal bleeding may have side effects. They said he is losing strength because intraveneous feeding alone can not supply enough nutrients, and he reportedly also is suffering from jaundice. Other than five or six spoonfuls of porridge Saturday morning and two small fragments of ice more than a week ago, the emperor has been unable to eat or drink since the onset of the crisis. News reports have said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is suffering from cancer of the upper intestine, but imperial officials have not confirmed or denied the reports.

 Bavarian Governor <PERSON> Franz-Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the country's leading ultra-conservative, was fighting for his life Sunday after collapsing the day before from a heart attack, officials said. `` His situation is serious,'' according to a state government statement released to the news media early Sunday. `` He is not out of life-threatening danger.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, 73, is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the Bavarian sister party of the nationally dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. He was hospitalized in the Bavarian city of <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION> after suffering a possible stomach rupture in addition to a heart attack that at first was suspected to be slight, the state governor's office said State spokesman <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwaabe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was stricken Saturday afternoon while on a hunting trip in the <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>, about 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schwaabe </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was conscious and his condition had stabilized by late Saturday evening. Doctors were planning to operate to correct <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' condition, <PERSON> Schwaabe </PERSON> said. However, the statement issued early Sunday superseded the earlier statements, indicating <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> had taken a turn for the worse. The outspoken <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> often has been at the center of national policy-making and has used international travels to wield influence over foreign policy as well. His thick Bavarian accent coupled with stinging comments also makes the outspoken, corpulent state governor <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most colorful politician. From 1966 to 1969, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> served as finance minister under then-Chancellor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiesinger </PERSON> in the so-called `` Great Coalition'' of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s conservative parties with the left-leaning Social Democrats. After the Social Democrats took over the government in coalition with the centrist, business-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> remained as a member of the federal parliament's conservative opposition until 1978, when he was elected Governor of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> Two years later he was nominated to run for chancellor but lost the election against Social Democrat <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> in 1980.

 Coffee-producing and consuming nations belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> agreed Sunday on new producers' export quotas aimed at stabilizing prices and improving availability of choice grades. The final negotiations were difficult, but the result was a `` good one,'' said <PERSON> Jorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s negotiating team. `` It was a positive outcome,'' said chief American delegate <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>. Delegates said the new deal is very complicated but is primarily designed to keep the average price of coffee _ currently $ 1.14 a pound _ above $ 1.15 dollars and below $ 1.45 in the 1988-89 marketing year which began Saturday. It calls for a global export quota _ the organization's means of price-control _ of 56 million bags for 1988-89. One bag equals 132 pounds. The group also agreed to ensure that consuming nations can obtain the sort of coffee they want, mainly the popular Latin American arabica grade. Under the old agreement, all cuts or increases in the global export quota were applied equally to all types of coffee. The new agreement favors the arabicas. Such a system would likely reduce market share for African robusta producers, delegates said. The basis for the 74-member group's final agreement was hammered out late Saturday at a meeting between top negotiators from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the world's biggest producers and consumers, delegates said. The talks had been bogged down over the system for adjusting quotas in relation to the movement in world prices.

 Democrats who hope Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will help the ticket win his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and perhaps the presidential election could do well to regard the fate of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassaway </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. In case anyone does n't remember, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was Democrat <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s running mate when <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ran for president against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> in 1904. The voters chose between <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, and their choice was <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> by a 3-2 margin. Experts concede that the vice presidential debate in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday between <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> may make a difference, but they say the voters' final decision will come down to a choice between the top of the tickets, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Unless <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is absolutely destroyed in the debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, I do n't think it will hurt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribuffo </PERSON>, a specialist in political history at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` People will be looking for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to blow it,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernell </PERSON>, professor of political science at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` If he can get through the debate in a competent fashion where he looks unexceptional, it will be a real success for him.'' <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant, said, `` I think it is reasonable to suggest that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have won <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state -RRB- without Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and with Mr. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still not going to carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. So you wash that out.'' `` I think the odds are that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will have little or no effect on the ultimate choice,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, program director for governmental studies at the Brookings Institution here. <PERSON> Elspeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostow </PERSON>, a political scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Lyndon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` does n't seem to have too much effect on the voters, at least so far.'' `` I do n't think, if indeed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was disposed to choose <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to appeal to women, that so far it has had that effect,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rostow </PERSON> said. `` I think the conventional wisdom that the selection of a running mate is rarely decisive one way or another is absolutely true,'' said <PERSON> Ribuffo </PERSON>. A survey conducted this year by the <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> supports this view. Eighteen percent of the 1,001 voters surveyed said they had changed their minds about a presidential candidate at one time or another because of their opinion of his running mate. Of those, 70 percent said they voted against that ticket. Political experts agree that if a running mate has any effect, he is more likely to hurt than help. Examples cited include President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s selection of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who was criticized for his slashing debating style in 1976, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who suffered from examination of her family's finances in 1984. `` Clearly in my opinion <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in 1976 in that debate -LRB- with <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s running mate -RRB- cost <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> votes,'' <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said. `` Clearly in 1984 in my opinion, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> cost <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> votes probably.'' In <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaign of 1960, some thought that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> hurt the ticket's chances by pledging that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> would appoint a black to the Cabinet _ a statement <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> disavowed. Lodge, a former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, also was criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough. `` Some have thought that if he had used his prestige from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> more effectively, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> might have edged out <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rostow </PERSON> said. There are exceptions to the rule that running mates do n't help much, the experts said.

<HEAD>Shuttle Launch Fraught With Tension, But Landing Also Risky</HEAD>

 The Challenger tragedy highlighted the danger of space shuttle launches, but astronauts also face risks when their orbiter rips through Earth's atmosphere and plunges toward landing `` like a streamlined brick,'' experts say. `` The landing is not as dramatic and exciting as the launch and does n't involve extremely powerful rockets, but there's no question landing is a very critical operation and requires a great deal of attention,'' said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON>, president of a <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> engineering consulting firm. Discovery is to conclude its four-day mission with a landing here Monday morning at 9:33 a.m. PDT. It will swoop across <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s coast at 4.37 times the speed of sound, slow to subsonic speeds, then drop at a steep angle before leveling out without any power and glide toward touchdown on the unpaved surface of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. `` It comes down like a streamlined brick,'' said <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chief engineer for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dryden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> at this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> military base, where 18 of 24 previous shuttle missions landed. Five flights landed at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and one at White Sands Missile Range, <PERSON> N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that while shuttle landings are less dangerous than launches, `` there is still an element of risk on whether or not you make this landing properly because a lot of it does rely on the pilot's judgment and you are approaching the ground at an extremely high rate of descent.'' The Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew members 73 seconds after liftoff from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prompted redesign of faulty shuttle booster rockets and many other changes, including installation of an emergency escape system so astronauts can bail out while approaching the landing site. The braking and steering systems also were modified in hope of avoiding the brake and tire damage that had occurred during earlier landings. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the changes were meant to eliminate mechanical and heat-caused brake damage, improve steering to provide better control in crosswinds or if tires blow out, and prevent bending of main landing gear axles caused by brake overheating. At the urging of astronauts and the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the Challenger disaster, shuttles will land here for the foreseeable future, frustrating <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s initial plans to save time and money by landing the spacecraft regularly back at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> launch site. The 44-square-mile dry lakebed at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> leaves plenty of room for safety if brakes fail or tires blow, while a similar mishap at the Cape could put the shuttle in the water. One of the first dangers associated with landing is the possibility that the shuttle could burn up in the atmosphere after the pilot turns the shuttle upside-down and backwards, fires small rockets in what is called the `` deorbit burn'' an hour before landing, then flips the shuttle forward again for re-entry. Onboard computers help keep the shuttle at the proper angle for re-entry, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> also modified Discovery's thermal tiles and blankets to improve its ability to withstand heat. `` I'm always a little concerned until he gets into the atmosphere,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> research projects office at Edwards. Years before shuttles flew, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials built Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules that parachuted to ocean splashdowns. They doubted a spacecraft could be built to land on Earth like an unpowered airplane. But they wanted a reusable space shuttle. Plane-like shuttle landings were made possible by years of experimental flights with X-series aircraft, wingless `` lifting bodies,'' and the Enterprise shuttle prototype, and by the advent of sophisticated computer guidance systems and heat-shield tiles that do n't burn during a return to the atmosphere. `` If we did n't have good computers, we would n't be able to do re-entry,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> aerospace engineer. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said another big hurdle for a shuttle pilot is `` energy management,'' which means making S-turns and other maneuvers to reduce the shuttle's speed as it approaches the landing site. `` If he does n't control his energy accurately enough he may overshoot <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and not have a place to land or undershoot and land in the water,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Because the shuttle glides to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> without power, `` there's no opportunity to go around,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` You've got to hit it the first time.'' `` There are a lot of systems where, if they fail, you'd have a problem,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` If the landing gear did n't deploy, you'd have a belly landing, which could be catastrophic.'' Another possible failure involves the shuttle's three auxiliary power units, or APUs, which power the hydraulic system that runs the spacecraft's control flaps, rudders and speed brakes. In a study commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and publicized last summer, <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON>'s engineering consulting firm of <PERSON> Pickard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> estimated there is a one-in-70 chance that all three APUs will fail during a landing attempt and cause the shuttle to crash. That estimate contains so much uncertainy that the actual risk could be as high as one in 30 or as low as one in several hundred, <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> contends the risk is even lower. On Sunday, the Discovery astronauts briefly switched on the APUs and reported they were working fine.

 Two trucks collided head-on in a ball of flames and rammed into a group of houses, killing four people, officials said Sunday. The incident occurred just before midnight Saturday on a blind curve in the road near the village of <LOCATION> Carmen </LOCATION>, about 500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, according to Lt.

A truck carrying a drum of gasoline exploded in flames when it hit a military vehicle, which hurtled into a wooden house and killed four sleeping students, <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> said. The first truck rammed into three nearby houses, starting a fire that gutted them, he said. The driver of the military truck escaped with only superficial injuries, while the second driver suffered third-degree burns, <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> said. He estimated property damage at $ 66,000.

<HEAD>Senate To Consider Tax Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just when it appeared <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might finish a year without amending the tax laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to consider a bill that would make hundreds of changes and create some protections for taxpayers involved in disputes with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike most of the other tax bills of the 1980s, there is little in this legislation to draw the concern of the average family. Most of the changes are intended to clear up ambiguities or correct errors in the 1986 tax overhaul. But there are tidbits for some farmers, oil drillers, free-lance writers, first-time homebuyers, banks and workers who receive educational assistance from their employers. All told, the bill would parcel out tax benefits worth $ 2.3 billion over three years. Most of the money to pay for those benefits would come from a higher tax bite on some corporations. The House has passed a much larger bill, costing about $ 7 billion. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passes its bill, negotiators would attempt to work out a compromise between the two versions before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for the year, likely by Oct. 15. Also awaiting action before adjournment are two issues with major political importance in this election year. One is the melding of separate anti-drug bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The second is final action on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> package of parental leave and anti-child-pornography legislation that could end up with a provision expanding benefits for child care. More than 100 amendments to the tax bill are awaiting consideration. One of the most contentious, written by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., would deny a tax exemption to any clinic that regularly performs abortion Although opponents say they have the votes to defeat that amendment, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> could tie up the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a considerable amount of time before the proposal ever reaches a vote. One of the few points of controversy already in the bill is drawing fire from tobacco-state lawmakers. It would require the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to study what effect the tax on cigarettes has on reducing smoking-related health problems. There is wide <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> support for the `` taxpayer bill of rights'' included in the legislation. The chief sponsor of the bill of rights, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., says it is necessary to rein in some <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees who, he contends, have trampled on taxpayer rights The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has opposed the bill of rights, saying some of its provisions would duplicate improvements already made by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> while others would hamper the agency's ability to collect taxes. Included in <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s plan are requirements that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> fully inform taxpayers of their rights any time a tax dispute arises and waive any penalty that is attributed to relying on written advice furnished by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. It would prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the basis of how much tax they collect and extend to 30 days the 10-day waiting period before assets may be seized to satisfy overdue taxes. The tax bill has been more than two years in development. The administration and tax professionals have been urging passage to clear up uncertainties left after the tax code was overhauled in 1986. The push for passage picked up support this year when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax committees added amendments exempting farmers and certain other business people from paying the federal diesel tax on fuel for off-road use. Under a 1987 law, they are required to pay the tax and file later for a refund. Other popular provisions in the bill would extend tax breaks for first-time homebuyers, corporate research, businesses that hire disadvantaged workers, and workers whose employers provide them with educational or legal assistance. In the last quarter-century, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed _ and presidents have signed _ major tax bills on the average of one a year. Since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office less than eight years ago, taxes were cut in 1981, raised in 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987, and thoroughly overhauled in 1986.

<HEAD>Bush Makes Himself A `Stealth Candidate' on Some Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently calls <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the `` Stealth candidate'' who makes his positions invisible on political radar, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself is doggedly vague on some issues when it finds it convenient. Where does the vice president stand, for instance, on raising the minimum wage or on parental job leaves? As he has reached out to low-income voters in recent weeks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he favors boosting the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $ 3.35 an hour for eight years. On parental leaves, he said women should not have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a baby or caring for a severely ill child. In neither case, however, has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> filled in the blanks with specifics. Neither issue is very popular with conservatives and his statements leave him at odds with the White House. So perhaps the less <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, the better. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said both are `` the kind of issue one ought not to be silent on'' during a political campaign. On the other hand, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not have to be specific. After a Republican-led filibuster, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped a bill that would have raised the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55 over three years. As president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no effort to bring the filibuster to a halt. The vice president has never said how much of an increase in the minimum wage he supported. `` He has not and will not attach any numbers to that,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. With the minimum wage bill dead, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is turning to a measure that would require employers to give unpaid leave to workers after childbirth or while caring for a sick child. Again, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not outlined his policy, other than a general statement of support for the concept. `` He made a passing reference to it,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. `` We have not laid out any particular formula.'' Is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff working on a formula? `` Not at this point, no,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> replied. There have been other times when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has raised an issue but not explained what he meant. In his first nationally televised debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked what he would do for the 37 million Americans who can not afford health insurance, many because they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid coverage for the needy. `` What I will do,'' he said, `` is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe that's the answer.'' The next day, a reporter asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, to explain what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was talking about. `` Well, all I know on that is that he thinks that would be an appropriate approach to explore,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked to elaborate on how the poor would `` buy into Medicaid,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied, `` It means taking a look at the Medicaid laws and Medicaid system, seeing if there's a way that these 22 to 37 million people have some way at minimal cost to finance health coverage for themselves.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also pulled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back from his statement in the debate suggesting that he would favor criminal penalties for women who have abortions if the procedure is declared illegal. `` I have n't sorted out the penalties,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said. `` ... there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately criticized that statement. The next morning, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> conferred with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and told reporters that `` it is his view that he would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal, not withstanding his view in favor of right to life.''

<TEXT>
 A U.S.-Vietnamese team embarked on a new expedition Sunday after a grueling trek through leech-infested mountains to retrieve the wreckage of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warplanes and interview villagers about the fate of crew members. During a search last week of <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON> and Bac Thai provinces northwest of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the team found villagers who recalled in detail what happened to airmen who bombed them during the Vietnam War more than 15 years ago. No human remains were recovered, but the villagers' accounts may help resolve the cases, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team members, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The war is over,'' one American investigator quoted villagers as saying. `` You caused a lot of death and destruction, but if you need help, we will help you.'' Two teams are conducting the first joint U.S.-Vietnamese field investigation to try to account for 1,757 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1973. Fighting ended when the communists defeated U.S.-backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975. The cooperative effort is seen as a major breakthrough in an issue marked by frequent bickering, deep distrust and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s reluctance to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to work in the countryside The team that searched crash sites in <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON> and Bac Thai for six days drove off in jeeps Sunday to investigate an area in <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ninh </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The second team continued work in <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bac </LOCATION> provinces just northeast of the capital. The 10-day search ends Wednesday. The teams each are comprised of three specialists from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, and four experts from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Office for Seeking Missing Personnel. They focused on a half-dozen of the 70 `` discrepancy cases'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has asked <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to resolve urgently. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say Vietnamese authorities at some level should have information about the 70 missing men. Some are known to have been captured but never were heard from again. Many areas of mountainous <PERSON> Vinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Phu </PERSON> and Bac Thai were not reachable by jeeps or by the motorcycles. The Americans said they walked, climbed and crawled about 30 miles investigating two cases in the area. They showed the marks left on their skin by the briar patches that sliced their arms and legs and by the numerous leeches that sucked blood from their feet. Each carried a backpack weighing up to 40 pounds containing metal detectors, satellite navigational devices and food. `` We went to some places where we were up to 2,000 feet and all you could see below was jagged rock, and the ledge we stood on was only a foot wide,'' one American said. `` It was breathtaking.'' They slept wherever they could, one night in a wooden hut that appeared to have been a guard post during the French colonial period, they said. Food was canned army rations and meals served by local officials, including roasted dog meat, snails, small wild birds, and as one American put it, chickens with their heads still on. `` The snails were great,'' one American said. `` The first snail I ate for my country and the rest for enjoyment.'' The search focused on the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nguyen </LOCATION> area of Bac Thai, a railway junction and steel mill center that was targeted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers during the war. The Americans retrieved pieces of wreckage which they will bring back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for analysis. They photographed other evidence, including certificates people hung in their houses in which the government commended them for shooting down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft. No human remains were recovered, but Vietnamese officials said that in some of the half-dozen cases, villagers claimed they knew where remains were.

<HEAD>Jet Fighters' High Accident Rate Puzzles Military</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, each puzzled by an unexpected increase in accidents this summer involving high-performing jets, have failed to find a common thread to explain the mishaps, officials say. From a historical standpoint, the current accident rates for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter and attack jets are not out of line, officials say. Indeed, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is actually enjoying one of its all-time safest years for aviation. Both services have mounted careful monitoring campaigns because of accident spurts involving the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14s and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s F-16s The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says it has found no equipment problems, but has changed some of its pilot training techniques and increased supervision because of the rise in mishaps. Officials say several of this year's F-16 accidents involved pilots who lost consciousness as a result of fast aerial maneuvers or who became disoriented and lost track of where they were. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has n't detected any equipment problems, either, but has made no change in pilot training. `` We're just not seeing any common threads at all to justify changes,'' says Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s accident spurt involves the service's top-of-the-line fighter, the F-14 Tomcat. The service went through the first eight months of 1988 with only one so-called Class A accident involving the F-14. The plane was lost but the two-man crew survived in that accident. A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage exceeding $ 500,000 to an aircraft. But in the single month of September, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lost five Tomcats _ two on one day _ and saw three of its aviators die. Two of the planes were lost on separate days from the same aircraft carrier, the USS <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON>, while on patrol duty in the northern Arabian Sea. During 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lost eight F-14s in accidents that produced two fatalities. The mishap rates this year for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-A-18 Hornet and A-6 Intruder, meantime, have dropped significantly below last year's levels Indeed, after the worst year ever for the F-A-18 in 1987 _ when 10 Class A accidents were reported _ only three such mishaps have occurred so far this year. On the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> side, the accident spurt involves the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Serious mishaps with that single-engine fighter have ballooned from 12 in fiscal 1987 to 23 in fiscal 1988, the year that ended on Friday. Seven F-16 pilots died in fiscal 1988, compared to five in fiscal 1987. And for the first time ever, fiscal 1988 saw the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lose three of the planes on one day _ June 29 _ in two accidents. The service acknowledges this year's increase in F-16 accidents has raised concerns about pilot training and whether the plane is too `` hot'' for some pilots to control. `` We attribute almost 70 percent of these F-16 losses to human error and have taken steps to correct that trend by focusing on causes of mishaps and placing emphasis on training and supervision,'' says Maj. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` We believe the F-16 is a very safe aircraft, and the lifetime statistics for the plane bear that out,'' added Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the chief of safety and nuclear surety in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office. `` But it's also a pretty sophisticated aircraft that can do a lot of things that aircraft in the past could n't do,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> added. The safety official said `` several'' of this year's accidents with the F-16 had involved pilots who lost consciousness as a result of unusually rapid aerial maneuvers. They said `` several more'' involved pilots who suffered `` spatial disorientation,'' losing track of where they were in the air. To counter those problems, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up pilot training in breathing and other techniques to handle heavy gravity forces; started a special education program on the type of physical fitness workouts needed to counter gravity forces; begun using huge centrifuge machines more frequently to condition young pilots, and added extra training in instrument flying so that pilots can maintain control of a plane even when they are physically disoriented. By contrast, the top-of-the-line <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter, the F-15 Eagle, enjoyed a banner year for safety. Only one Eagle crashed in fiscal 1988 and the pilot survived. Three of the planes and two pilots were lost in fiscal 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says the F-15 normally posts a better safety record than the F-16, in part because the Eagle has two engines and the Falcon only one, and in part because the Falcon must train for air-to-ground attacks as well as air-to-air fight.

 A little wooden bridge is saving motorists and buggies a lot of trouble in this northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town. When the state proposed a 4.5-mile detour rather than put up a temporary structure while it replaced a small 60-year-old bridge spanning a creek, a group of <LOCATION> Sparta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> residents got together and built their own. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> estimated building a temporary bridge would take two weeks and cost at least $ 50,000, but the local people built theirs in two days with donated materials, their own labor and $ 7,722. About half of the residents along the road are <LOCATION> Amish </LOCATION> and Mennonite farmers who drive horses and buggies and they wanted to avoid the proposed detour along two miles of bumpy dirt road. `` Did n't cost the state a thing,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, who helped organize the bridge work when it was built in June. `` We saved them money, and we saved everyone around here a lot of money and inconvenience.'' The temporary bridge, which had no trouble passing state inspection, will be out of business in about two weeks. The new $ 239,000 permanent bridge is almost finished.

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he views this week's vice presidential debate with <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as `` a golden opportunity for me to just be myself'' and to focus on his real opponent, Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said in a weekend interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he's not worried about making any of his celebrated gaffes during the nationally televised debate at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, although `` there's always that possibility.'' Sounding confident about the confrontation with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` I will be prepared. I'll be ready.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee said he will target his attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rather than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator whose views <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said are more in tune with Republicans than Democrats. `` The opponent for me is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` He's the one that's running for president He's the one that if he would get in, I think it'd be very difficult time for this country. ... My target and my discussion and my focus that evening will be on the governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, home in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, are spending the next two days making final preparations for their debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> embarks Monday on a campaign tour of major industrial states, including <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to greet the Discovery space shuttle astronauts when they land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will field the first question from the panel of journalists. He admitted he is somewhat nervous but said `` the butterflies will be gone when I get out there.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is most comfortable speaking extemporaneously with the help of a few notecards. `` Public speaking is very easy,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate has been dogged by intense media scrutiny into his military service, academic record and personal life, and he occasionally has responded with highly publicized misstatements. He said his malapropisms, usually uttered when he is not reading a prepared text, have been blown out of proportion. `` When you make as many speeches and you talk as much as I do and you get away from the text, it's always a possiblity to get a few words tangled here and there but it's a very small number of miscues,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he is not worried about slipups on Wednesday. `` The reason I'm not is because it's going to be questions and answers. There's always that possibility, but I'm a very confident person,'' he said. Campaign strategists have said that because <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been portrayed as a lightweight candidate, anything short of a major blunder during the debate will allow him to surpass the low expectations for his performance. `` I'm treating it as an opportunity to get up there, respond to the questions, tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people where I want to lead this country with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ... and articulate a vision for the future,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` So I do n't look at it as low expectations, high expectations. I'll leave that to others. What I perceive this debate as is a golden opportunity for me to just be myself,'' he said. His aides say they have advised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, to tone down his boyish exuberance so he will appear dignified and mature beside the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been coached to speak more slowly and curb his hand gestures during the debate. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he is not worried about being compared unfavorably with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Age alone is not the only qualification for vice president or president. You have to look at experience, you've got to look at judgment, you've got to look if you can make a difference,'' he said. `` I believe I can make a difference ... like I have made a difference in areas like job training and national defense.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says his debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will have some impact on the electorate, but how much is uncertain. `` When they go in that voting booth they're going to be voting for a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that's where their attention is going to be and that's where the election is going to be decided,'' he said.

 A school bus driver who was mistakenly jailed twice and accused of being a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> deserter may be at the end of his military troubles, after authorities caught the man they believe used his identity to enlist and then disappear. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities took custody Saturday of <PERSON> Dartanyian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 29, of suburban <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who had been arrested earlier in the week on charges of stealing auto parts, according to <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was found to be carrying a military identification card with his own photo but the name of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>. The card said he had served on the USS Roosevelt, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been looking for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> ever since a sailor by that name disappeared from the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> 18 months ago. School bus driver <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has been hauled in twice during that time as a deserter, most recently Sept. 25, even though he never enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The fake <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> used <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>'s name and Social Security number to enter the military, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities said. `` We picked up the real wrong <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> ... and I'm sure <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> is a happier guy today,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Saturday. `` He -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said he was sorry <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> got locked up and everything.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he heard a radio news report Friday about the real <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>'s troubles with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> had been arrested and released on bond Wednesday on the theft charges. `` I thought, ` I do n't believe it,''' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` What a lucky coincidence. The timing was perfect.'' When <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> came to the police station to pick up his car Friday evening, he was arrested and held overnight until <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities could pick him up, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> told police he previously had served in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> under his own name and was discharged, then re-enlisted using the Social Security number of <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>, a former neighbor, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> had been a neighbor of his. `` He just said he had enough and decided to get out because he got tired of using ... <PERSON> Finch </PERSON>'s name there,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Bus driver <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> was released from custody Thursday at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he had been held after <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> arrested him four days earlier.

 Sunday was last call for tipplers at Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s bar, a one-time haunt of politicians and pro athletes that turned rowdy and wound up as the last business on what was once the city's most crime-ridden block. Under a city condemnation edict, a wrecking ball will obliterate the block that was considered, until other spots closed in the last few months, the most decadent strip of entertainment establishments in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Crime statistics in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> pale in comparison to bigger cities. But Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s and its neighbors were hard to ignore on busy <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, just a block from the heart of the city's downtown shopping district Before 1971, the bar was the 620 Club, once owned by former <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. `` It was a bar and restaurant that catered to politicians from <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> on down,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, referring to the late senator and vice president. `` It was the gathering place for the social elite.'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> is an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who led the drive to raze the block for redevelopment. In 1971, the bar was sold and became Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s, which advertised `` a whale of a drink'' on the cheap. It also became a Moby Dick-size headache for local officials. Before the condemnation process started, its neighboring buildings housed porn shops, strippers, prostitutes and transients. The block was home to about one-fourth of all downtown crime, <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. The 600 trouble calls made to Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s by police in 1986 were `` several hundred more'' than to any other address in the city, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Niebur </PERSON>. `` That bar has been a whale of a problem for the police department ever since it opened,'' said <PERSON> Niebur </PERSON>. Last December, <PERSON> Niebur </PERSON> led a raid on Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s in which seven weapons were confiscated, along with a `` supermarket'' of illicit drugs from a crowd of about 300 customers. The raid, and sales of drugs to undercover officers by employees and customers, resulted in a 30-day suspension of the bar's liquor license in March and April. During that period, crime on the block dropped 30 percent, <PERSON> Niebur </PERSON> said. `` Moby's is a perfect example of the type of cesspool that breeds crime. You've got to attack it,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON>, police chief in this <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> city of 360,000 people, set in a metropolitan area of about 2 million. `` It's true that people from out of town have commented that this block does n't appear to be that bad,'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. `` But that's relative It depends on the level of crime in a city itself.'' About 50 murders have been committed so far this year in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said Sunday. `` I would say <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> is still a fairly safe city,'' he added. According to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> figures for 1986, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s major crime rate per 100,000 people was 2.5, compared with 10.7 for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 11.3 for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and 11.7 for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Under `` quick take'' condemnation proceedings, the city acquired the entire block this year and ordered tenants out. Demolition is scheduled to start later this month to make way for a parking lot and possibly a $ 75 million complex of gleaming entertainment, retail and hotel space. Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s will be missed _ if not by police, then by patrons. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>, 66, a retired construction worker, has frequented it since 1971. `` If you never brought trouble in here, you never got trouble,'' <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said from his regular perch at Moby's 50-foot rectangular bar. `` I hate to see it go.'' `` There's just as much bad out in the suburbs,'' said regular <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Champs </PERSON>, 44. `` This place at one time was a great taste of the big city,'' said former bartender <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, 31. `` If you wanted trouble you could find it real easy, but that's not what most people came here for.''

 <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the ultra-conservative Bavarian governor who has helped guide <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since its founding, was in extremely serious condition Sunday after suffering a heart attack, officials said. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, 73, collapsed Saturday during a weekend hunting expedition. `` He is in danger of dying,'' Dr. <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Manz </PERSON> said Sunday at the <LOCATION> Regensburg </LOCATION> hospital where <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was being treated. `` He is unconscious and is on a respirator.'' <PERSON> Manz </PERSON>, head of the medical team caring for the governor, said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> suffered a mild heart attack brought on by an as yet undetermined internal disorder.

 Negotiators representing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met Sunday to discuss the release of eight Americans and one Briton held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the editor of an Israeli newspaper said. `` According to our information, meetings have been going on during the weekend and will continue through the week in the same place,'' said <PERSON> Hesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kestin </PERSON>, managing editor of the Nation newspaper. <PERSON> Kestin </PERSON> said in an interview that the sessions were being held `` near <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'' and included delegations representing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and `` a mixed group'' of intermediaries. He did not elaborate. The Nation, an English-language weekly that began publication a month ago, reported Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has struck a secret deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, promising economic aid and arms sales in exchange for the release of eight of the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. It said the deal would include the release of frozen Iranian assets in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, White House officials and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> all denied the report. According to the Nation, which quoted unidentified sources in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would secure the release of five American hostages on or around Oct. 7. A second group of hostages, including three Americans and a Briton _ possibly <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a special envoy of the Archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> _ would be released a week later, the report said. All are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We are not negotiating directly with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters Friday. `` We have not talked to the kidnappers. I think maybe <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is putting these stories out.'' Asked about the denials, <PERSON> Kestin </PERSON> said: `` I think there probably are very strong reasons why <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the whole administration are backing off the story. But I think everyone is taking it seriously.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was following the hostage situation, `` but the denials from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stand,'' according to an embassy official who requested anonymity. Seventeen foreign hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of hostages. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday, kidnappers holding three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educators and an Indian professor said they would release one hostage to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The group, the Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free, or when. The wife of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a professor of mathematics and computor science, said Sunday she was hopeful that her husband, two other American educators and an Indian colleague will be freed soon after their captors release one of them. `` This is an encouraging sign. I hope the captors will fulfill their promise to release one of the hostages, whoever they choose to free, because that would mean the others have a much better chance,'' <PERSON> Badr </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday.

 The foreign minister would neither confirm nor deny reports Sunday that South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has promised the unconditional release of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was responding to reports that the president promised the release of the jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader during a meeting Saturday with President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> was quoted Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` I obtained from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> a firm commitment that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will soon be freed without any conditions, that he will be allowed to return to his home without any constraints.'' A French news report also said President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> he would release <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, is considered the most popular leader among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disenfranchised black majority. He has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> as saying in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> gave his `` solemn promise'' he will not send <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> back to prison once he recovers from tuberculosis in a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> nursing home. The report was at first denied by <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, if quoted properly, was overstating the gist of the summit discussion.

 Government troops surrendered the town of <LOCATION> Asmar </LOCATION>, in northeastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, to Moslem rebels after a two-month siege, a guerrilla spokesman said Sunday. <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-zia </PERSON> said the takeover of <PERSON> Asmar </PERSON> was a strategic victory for the rebels.

<HEAD>British Airways To Ban Smoking On Domestic Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday it will ban smoking on all domestic flights beginning Oct. 30, but not on international routes. `` The surveys tell us the longer the flights, the less support there is for a ban,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' marketing director. He said the ban was supported by research conducted among 2,199 domestic passengers in August that showed 85 percent of non-smokers and 42 percent of smokers supported a smoking ban on flights of up to one hour. More than half the passengers, 59 percent, said they would be more inclined to fly with <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> if the smoking ban were introduced, compared with 12 percent who said they would be less inclined to do so, he said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the survey results showed fewer than 30 percent of passengers now smoke on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> flights. British Airways, the country's largest airline, carries about 5 million passengers annually on its domestic flights. Three small <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> carriers _ Air <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Loganair </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> _ also have banned smoking on domestic as well as international flights. But British Airways' main domestic competitior, British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, continues to offer smoking sections. Smoking bans already have been introduced on most American, Canadian and Australian domestic flights. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the government forces airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights shorter than two hours, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has no national laws concerning smoking.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Stansfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Sunday <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fostered close ties with Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but he did not know whether the vice president played a role in reinstating the Panamanian ruler to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll in the 1980s. `` It's not a coincidence that every time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in the government, we were very friendly with the Noriegas and the Marcoses -LRB- former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- and that ilk,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who headed the agency in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration and now supports presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was taken off the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll after <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> became director in March 1977. But payments to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> resumed during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> denied published reports that he had accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of instigating a resumption of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payments to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But he said that during his term at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, payments to a powerful figure such as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have been brought to the attention of the president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been a `` very small player'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, but during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was the de facto head of state. `` You do n't put a head of state on the payroll without considerable attention to it, which normally would be to the top,'' he said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, denied on Friday that the Republican presidential candidate had anything to do with putting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> back on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as vice president, would have no formal role in approving such payments, he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges and tried to remove him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationship with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` warmer and stronger'' when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in government than at other times. For instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> both as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and vice president. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also received money from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during those points in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s career. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he never met <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, although he served at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> longer than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director for a year. He also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in the first presidential debate last week, tried to make it appear that everyone was friendly with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` That is patently untrue,'' he said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> also claimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> misused the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in his campaign, referring to remarks in the debate about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefings both presidential candidates received. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said both he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were told that seven administrations were involved with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the fact that the briefing went into great detail about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s involvement with previous administrations was designed to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a debating point and weaken <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ties to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called it a `` set up'' and said: `` This is a real serious problem. You can not use the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> for domestic political purposes without running the credibility of the organization into the ground.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president so Americans can `` return to some sort of ethical center,'' but said he does not work for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. Since leaving the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has written a book and given lectures. He sits on the boards of several corporations.

 Q: I have a question for <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>. Can you give us some idea of your flight plan for tomorrow, your landing patterns and what landmarks you ` ll be looking for as you come in? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: We'll be coming in just about between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, overhead the coast at about 110,000 feet and circling around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds permit to land on <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> runway 17. We'll pass overhead the field at about 40,000 feet, becoming subsonic. You all can hear as we're supersonic a double sonic boom When you hear that, you'll know we're about five minutes from landing. And then we'll make a standard approach, 300 miles per hour, coming down to a touchdown at 200 miles per hour on that lakebed. Q: For <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>. There are two men now running for president. What would you say to them from the shuttle to convince them to fully support the space program and its longterm future, even if it means putting up budget increases for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in a time of considerable deficits. Lounge: That's a tough one. I think we have to take the long view. This is a very important flight simply because it's the first step. I would hope that all of the enthusiasm that we've seen throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if we're going to make this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to get us on the path to the future. Q: Gentlemen, the Challenger crew set out to teach some very important lessons to the children of the world. I would like to know what lessons you would hope would be taken from your flight and the effort it took to get to where you are today? Covey: <PERSON> John </PERSON>, I've got a couple of young daughters and I know what I would like them to learn from what I've done is that there is always a reward for hard work, both individually and as a group, much like the effort that was put forth by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the contractors to get the space shuttle flying again. And that there are new adventures everywhere and space is one of them and hopefully that all of the young children out there who want to come to space someday will at least have the opportunity to try. Q: For Commander <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. Admiral Truly told us yesterday that `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> really threaded the needle on your launch.'' With the extra emphasis on safety and a lot of flexibility, apparently, in the launch schedule, do you think the launch came a little too close to violating the safety criteria? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Oh, as I understand your question, do we think the launch came too close to violating safety criteria. Not from my perspective. That is, we were very comfortable with the liftoff as it was executed. We thought the launch team, as a matter of fact after main engine cutoff we were complimentary within ourselves to the launch team and the way they handled a few minor annoyances down close to the launch, the question of our cabin pressure and so forth. From our perspective, we could n't have been happier with the way that launch went off and the countdown too. Q: I have a question for <PERSON> Pinky </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. As a trained research scientist, can you tell us how well the several experiments that you have managed could have been executed by automated equipment with no people on board? <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: Well, to be honest with you a number of these could have been run automated. The advantage of running them in the mode that we have -LRB- interrupted by signal drop -RRB- ... Let me add one thing, and that is all of the experiments that we brought on board this time have exceeded my expectations in the way they have run. Q: Do you feel you have fulfilled all the objectives of the mission and what, if any, recommendations do you have for changes in the orbiter? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: The machine worked superbly. I'm not sure that we've had a mission that has been this trouble-free with an orbiter before. Have to talk with the folks on the ground, I guess. We have flown with our launch and entry suits for the first time since the first four missions. We do find those to be a bit of an encumbrance. We'll need to talk very seriously about whether there's a bit of a, I'll call it, a bit of compromise that we would like to make. It's certainly a trade between the advantage that the suit gives us should we have a problem and the fact that it does n't allow us quite the flexibility that we had before I guess that's the major one. And I ca n't think of any others. Q: What's the Hispanic contribution to the space program so far? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Could you repeat the question please? Q: The question is what is the Hispanic contribution to spaceflight before. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Well, I'd say there's no doubt about it that we've hundreds of thousands of people out throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that have worked on the space program and I think that every race, every minority group is represented They may not be represented to the degree that that group might like, but I know that in our travels throughout the country to the various centers and the contractors, we have spoken with a number of Hispanics and many of which we have worked closely with at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and I think it's really a contribution of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that we're really very proud of Q: We've heard a lot in the last few days about the cabin getting warm. Can you tell us how comfortable are you and the rest of the crew as far as cabin temperature, and what kinds of things are your doing to keep cool? Lounge: It was a little warmer than it is now in the first couple of days of the flight because of the flash evaporator problem. Today, we feel we've got that working pretty well. We've been boiling water all day long to cool the vehicle and I put on a long-sleeve shirt and we've all got long pants on for the first time It's not been bad at all, really. Q: Pinky, good wishes from everyone in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, especially our home town in <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>. Before you left, you said you were going to monitor your own physical and mental responses to the liftoff phase of the mission because you had not specific tasks. What did you learn? <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: We're going to have a good tolerance for heat, I guess. It's pretty warm in the suit. This is where I launched, there where <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> is sitting. I did n't have much of a view so I paid a lot of attention to my body. It's difficult to breathe during the 3 G part of the flight, mainly because of the weight of the suit and the harness. You can feel a little bit of the inside of your body shifting around with the weight and then shifting back again as the engines cut off. I've got some more on my tape some place. I'll have to tell you about it later

During your ascent, could you tell that at all? Did it have any effect whatsoever on the vehicle when you reached 30,000 to 40,000 foot? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: No, those are forces that are masked and would be masked by the vibrations that we feel just from the resonance and acoustic vibrations from the solid rocket motors.

And if there should be some standards? <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: If the question is how are we going to handle international cooperation within our own program, I think you do that through planning ahead of time, through standards that you set and through the procedures that you use so that by the time you get around to flying with an international group, or international crew, you're all working with the same procedures, you all have the same knowledge and capabilities of carrying those out so that there's really going to be no difference among the crew whether it's all American or has internationals on board. Q: Could you appraise the mission management team process before liftoff, and whether you can tell your colleagues who will follow you if it works well. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Well, this gives me an opportunity to thank my good friend Captain <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> for the outstanding job that he did from our perspective in pulling that all together. And this did n't all just happen, of course, in the last few days before the launch. It was a many-month effort and I thought that management team _ of all that I saw in close at the FRRs for the main engine firings and FRRs for the orbiter itself _ I was just very happy, and I think that bodes very well for the way we do business. Q: You've been taking photos of phenomena on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> such as volcanoes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and hurricane damage in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. What have you observed there that might be of value to those areas? <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>: Well, I think some of the biggest things that we've seen are things like deforestations, we've seen erosion, we've seen some land usage that kind of disturbs us And I think the good lesson is that we take back these photos to men on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in their respective countries to make sure that they take care of what nature has given them and to make sure it is used wisely. Our environment is a very fragile thing and I think that's something that we're very impressed by when we take photos and as we look out the window. Q: Have you caught yourself being so excited at times or other crew members around you that you've had to subdue yourself? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Yes, yes we do. As a matter of fact it's good that we're _ I think if we were a crew of one, the possibility of getting distracted by the beautiful sights and the fun of being up here could perhaps cause you to not pay enough attention to what you're The crew concept is a wonderful thing and it keeps us on our toes. Q: On liftoff day, there was an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about Freedom, the space station. Do you have any comment on that? <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: I think that's great. That just means we can pull together even more time working on the same problems and the same solutions and if there's a team up here that can get a lot more done than five people individually, there's no question that the unique cultures that each of the international partners bring to this effort will be synergistic and make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts. Q: What do you think now, Pinky, about the future of the space shuttle as a platform for scientific platform? <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>: I think the future is bright for a scientific use for the space shuttle. As I mentioned before, the middeck that we're in is really a national resource. Many scientists will be glad to have a room this size with zero gravity inside it that has electricity and water available for them to do their experiments in. I think it will be used extensively in the future, probably primarily as a development lab, as a test bed for experiments such as the ones we've got on board where prototypes can be tested and where new concepts can be proven that can then later be developed and expanded and put into free-flying satellites or put on board the space station in production facilities. Q: As you get ready for landing, do the problems with the flash evaporator system and one of the OMS rockets concern you, if no why not. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>: Well of course, they're something that concerns you if you have the next failure. Our understanding right now is that the flash evaporator, though, we expect it to work almost fully up to its potential and we could sustain another failure and still be in good shape. That's also the case with the orbital maneuvering engines. It's true that we do have one thrust vector control system down on the last engine, but we have a backup and we also have the capability of locking that control system in its current position and still de-orbit, plus we could shut down one engine and come back on the other engine and if that would fail, we could come back on the reaction control system. So we have quite a backup capability there.''

<TEXT>
 A television talk show on missing children was the catalyst that led to a reunion between a mother and her daughter who ran away a dozen years ago at age 17. `` I'm so excited. We have n't come off our cloud yet,'' <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> said after being met by her daughter, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON>, at the airport in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Saturday night. `` I saw a blonde head and I knew it was her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said. `` I threw my arms around her. I touched her face. It was very teary, but very happy.'' The two had not seen each other since Mrs. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> dropped her daughter off at night school in <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> on March 31, 1976. The teen-ager vanished without a trace. `` I gave her a big ol' hug, I cried and kissed her, and told her I loved her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> said after the airport reunion. `` Now I feel like I'm a hundred pounds lighter. I wish I had called her sooner.'' That call came to the <LOCATION> Barron </LOCATION> home in <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Ms. <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> saw an <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> television program about missing children and their families. `` I was watching the program, and I decided to call,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> said from her <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> home. `` Many times I had felt like calling, but held myself back. A lot of it was pride on my part, which was stupid.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> was preparing dinner for guests when the telephone rang. `` I was shocked,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said. `` I partially burnt the dinner, but that's OK.'' Ms. <PERSON> Thibault </PERSON> and her husband of two years, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON>, met her mother and other family members from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> at the airport She declined to explain why she ran away, or what she has been doing for the past 12 years, saying: `` That's another story, and I'd rather not discuss it. It's between me and my mother.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said she has n't questioned her daughter about her disappearance, adding, `` The only important thing right now is she's here. Some day, when the time is right, we'll talk about it.'' One good thing that came out of her separation from her family, Ms. <PERSON> Thiebault </PERSON> said, was her marriage. `` I wish I had gone back,'' she said. `` But if I had, I would n't have met my husband.''

<HEAD>Panel To Finalize Decision on Aborted Fetal Tissue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special federal advisory committee meets later this month to formalize its tentative recommendation supporting the use of intentionally aborted fetal tissue for research. The emotional nature of the issue has been underscored by a Roman Catholic theologian's strong exception to the way the outcome of the panel's three-day session last month was portrayed. But Father <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>, a professor of theology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, does not dispute that the earlier committee action made clear the panel will recommend going forward with fetal tissue research when it completes a written report. The 21-member committee meets Oct. 20-21 to take final action on a report to be forwarded to a standing <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee by Nov. 1. <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> has contended that news accounts assigned more finality to the action of the committee on Sept. 16 than was technically warranted. `` There was clearly a sense in which the committee was going,'' <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview. `` There was clearly a drift.'' `` What I objected to was a variety of statements saying that we had recommended something, albeit tentatively,'' he said. `` We did n't recommended a thing.'' The key vote was a 19-0 count, with two abstentions, that was reported as the committee's tentative recommendation. <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> maintains that, not only was the vote a procedural one to get language on the table for discussion, but that it ultimately was annulled anyway. Retired federal appeals Judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the panel chairman, disagrees. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, characterizing himself as a conservative with serious concerns about the morality of abortion, said he was sensitive to <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>'s underlying concern that the committee's earlier action could be taken as a tacit approval of the morality of abortion. But he specifically declined to back <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>'s position that the reporting was misleading on the fundamental question of whether the committee clearly, albeit tentatively, lined up in favor of recommending going forward with fetal tissue research. `` In effect, what we said, and this was only tentative, ` We are willing to go ahead with the use of fetal tissue in medical research if we could take a series of steps to insure that the abortion procedure is sufficiently insulated from the medical research that comes afterward,''' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` We were very careful not to deal with the highly volatile emotional question of abortion. We knew it was there, but we advertently decided not to deal with it. We never could have made any progress had we gotten into that area because the commission would have been sharply divided.''

 Actress <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> fight its alcoholism problem, said Sunday that a hotline session taught her the disease makes no distinction between people of the two superpowers. `` The problems are the same. The feelings are the same. The love is the same,'' Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> told reporters during an informal meeting sponsored by the Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference on Alcoholism and Drug Addiction. `` The only difference is the language,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, daughter of two alcoholics and mother of a daughter who struggled with drug addiction, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday to share her experiences with Soviets. On Saturday, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> and her daughter, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, talked about addiction for three hours to Soviet citizens who phoned two telephone numbers published by the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. The same day, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> marked the seventh anniversary of her decision to stop taking drugs. `` Many people believed it was impossible to achieve sobriety,'' Miss <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said of the callers. `` I'm here as proof they're wrong. Few callers knew much about the actress and her daughter, and it did n't matter, Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Callers were given a telephone number they could contact for further help. Soviet officials said the American actress and comedienne is not well known in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but that they value her knowledge and experience as they try new approaches to fighting the country's serious alcohol problem In May 1985, in his first major campaign after taking power, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> slashed alcohol production, raised the drinking age, and cut the hours liquor stores could stay open. The labor newspaper Trud said in July that since 1985, the number of alcoholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had dropped 17 percent, but it said the number of drug addicts was 2.5 times higher. Some officials recently have begun to question the effectiveness of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program. Long lines form outside liquor stores, moonshining has created a shortage of sugar and alcoholism has come off the streets and into the home, they say. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drozhdov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s chief official in charge of drug and alcohol use, said in an interview that his country now needs a more sophisticated approach. He said the new plan must include scientific and sociological studies of addiction, as well greater emphasis on dealing with individuals, so they recognize that `` it's your problem, not somebody else's.'' With the help of the joint conference on alcohol and drug abuse, which was formed in 1986, several chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous have been formed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentik </PERSON>, head of the department of the psychiatry of alcoholism at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical-Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Problems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcology </ORGANIZATION>, said Alcoholics Anonymous has provided a universally valid method of self-help for alcoholics. J.W. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, chairman of the joint conference, said the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> groups have so far helped one person quit drinking, and termed that `` a great success. One life is the greatest thing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has.'' Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> is to address students at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> institute of foreign langauges on Monday and appear on a Tuesday morning television news program and in a film to be broadcast Tuesday evening. Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s visit was sponsored by state-run Soviet radio and television.

 The 1988 Summer Olympics, kept free of terrorism but tainted by drug scandals, closed Sunday with the pealing of a medieval bell to symbolize the sorrow of parting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finished third in medals. The 1,000-year-old, 72-ton <ORGANIZATION> Emille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which according to Korean legend has the saddest tone of any in the world, tolled farewell to the more than 9,000 athletes from 160 nations who participated in the 24th Olympiad. The 16-day event, conducted under extraordinary security, wrapped up with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> winning the lion's share of the 237 medals events. The Soviets took home 132 medals, including 55 gold, the most ever in a Summer Olympics without a major-power boycott. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had 102 medals and 37 gold, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 94 medals and 36 gold. Many felt that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was robbed of a second-place tie for golds when judges awarded a bout to a South Korean boxer over American <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in the 156-pound event on the final day of competition. Because of boycotts in 1980 and 1984, the Games were the first meeting between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1976 in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, and matchups between the two nations provided some of the Games' highlights. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> men's volleyball team beat the Soviets to defend its 1984 Olympic championship, providing consolation for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s upset in the men's basketball quarterfinals <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also defeated the Soviets in women's basketball and men's water polo. At least 1 billion people watched the Olympics via a 115-nation, worldwide TV hookup. The Seoul Games had the greatest number of athletes -LRB- 9,633 -RRB-, the most countries, the most gold medals and the most venues -LRB- 34 -RRB-. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which demanded a role in the Games, boycotted them, but the only sports power to follow suit was <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Among the highlights: _ <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Louganis </PERSON> won the Olympic Spirit Award as top <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> athlete Sunday for winning gold medals in platform and 3-meter springboard diving He accomplished the same feat in 1980 and became the first man to sweep the events twice. The 28-year-old <PERSON> Louganis </PERSON>, who hit his head on the board in the preliminaries and received five stitches, announced his retirement from diving and said he wanted to pursue acting. _ Sisters-in-law <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner-Kersee </PERSON> led an American assault on the record books in track and field <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> won golds in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meter relay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay. She set a world record in the 200 and an Olympic record in the 100. <PERSON> Joyner-Kersee </PERSON> won two golds, taking the heptathlon with a world record 7,291 points and the long jump with an Olympic mark of 24 feet, 3 -LCB- inches. _ <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> won six golds in swimming American swimmer <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Biondi </PERSON> won seven medals, five gold, while <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> earned three golds in the pool for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Daniela </PERSON> <PERSON> Silivas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> dominated women's gymnastics, winning three golds, two silvers and a bronze _ West German <PERSON> Steffi </PERSON> <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> completed tennis's first Golden Slam, winning the gold medal as well as all four Grand Slam tournaments _ Wimbledon and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, French and Australian Opens _ in a calendar year There were low moments as well. Canadian sprinter <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the most prominent of 10 athletes who tested positive for drugs, was stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters and title of world's fastest man, and flew home in disgrace, his career in jeopardy. He was accused of using muscle-building steroids. Four other medals _ two Bulgarian weightlifting golds, a Hungarian weightlifing silver and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> judo bronze _ also were stripped for drugs, and five non-medalists tested positive for substances ranging from caffeine to diuretics. Early in the Games, five people connected to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> boxing team were suspended for attacking a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> referee after a Korean lost a decision to a Bulgarian. Another Korean boxer staged a 67-minute sit-in in the ring to protest his loss. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hembrick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boxer expected to win a gold, never got to fight; his coach misread the schedule and he missed the bus to the arena. Two gold medal-winning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swimmers were arrested for carrying a stone lion's head out of a hotel bar, but charges were dropped. American runner <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> kicked a taxicab in an argument with its driver. He was arrested and released. Security measures against the possibility of terrorism were extraordinary, including metal detectors, numerous checkpoints and ID cards, but except for scattered protests by student radicals, the Games proceeded without incident.

<HEAD>U.S. Vietnam Veterans Meet Soviet Soldiers In Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The agony of war forged a bond between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans of the Vietnam War and Soviet soldiers who survived a similar ordeal in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with both groups discovering they had much more to share than combat stories. `` We embraced before we even spoke to each other,'' said <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who is among a group of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans visiting their counterparts in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The trip, which began Sept. 26, was arranged to share expertise in treating casualties of war. Among the 21 American specialists of artificial limbs, computer aids for the handicapped and psychological therapy were eight veterans of the Vietnam War. Commonalities of their experiences overwhelmed the fact that <PERSON> Meshad </PERSON>'s attackers carried Soviet rifles or that <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s concussion occurred when a U.S.-made mine blew up his troop vehicle Both groups fought in conflicts that carried none of the glory of World War II, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were allies. Both returned home not as heroes, but in many cases as problems. Beyond the camaraderie, they shared tactics for pressuring the government to help those who suffered mental and physical trauma while serving their countries. The Americans complained about the lack of help from the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> but `` we have no such organization at all,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavrov </PERSON>, who served in western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> from 1984 to 1986. More than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops were sent into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to support government troops against Moslem guerrillas. They began pulling out in May under terms of an accord signed in April. Because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has insufficient medical care for the 36,000 soldiers injured in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` the experience of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans on how to get help is very important,'' <PERSON> Lavrov </PERSON> said. The handicapped are having trouble getting services, but the Afghan veterans with lingering mental problems face a wall of ignorance, the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> veterans said. `` We are back in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, but our hearts and our heads are not,'' <PERSON> Lavrov </PERSON> said. `` When we sleep, we often see <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. We see our dead friends, we see the mountains, we see our soldiers' life. The Soviets `` have absolutely no concept of psychiatric help,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Figley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran in the group who is now a <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist. <PERSON> Figley </PERSON> wrote some of the earliest books on post-traumatic stress syndrome among the former American soldiers. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans returned to an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> painfully divided over the war, but the first Soviet veterans of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> came home to a nation that did n't even know they'd been to battle, <PERSON> Figley </PERSON> said. The Soviet veterans reported `` their parents were told they were planting flowers and trees, that it was environmental assistance'' they were offering the Afghanis. Later, with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, citizens started to learn about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Courts, Lawyers Struggle To Place Price Tag On Crash Victims'
Lives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The varied and complex lives of the people killed in the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 are being run through statistical tables and computers as lawyers seek compensation for the victims' families. Some of the attorneys handling the 111 suits stemming from the Aug. 16, 1987, crash near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport have estimated that settlements with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the plane's manufacturer, could reach $ 250 million. In all, 156 people died in the crash. One passenger, a 4-year-old girl, survived. Those estimates are derived from what some lawyers concede is an imprecise and sometimes intrusive process of evaluating a victim's life `` In many ways you are following a table,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunin </PERSON>, a Philadelphia-based actuarial consultant and a specialist in personal injury cases. `` It's not really the value of a person that we're determining, but lost earning capacity, value of future support, monetary support.'' `` Many countries provide extensive social services to people who are injured or families who have lost their primary support,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> lawyer whose firm is handling about two dozen of the Flight 255 suits pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` In this country, social services are minimal by comparison and that's why you hire lawyers and go to court to protect yourself.'' Three lawsuits stemming from the crash have been settled without trial. The amounts of those settlements are sealed under court orders. Negotiations can take a less decorous turn when attorneys begin citing factors such as school records, medical data and employment history in seeking settlements. But some of the Flight 255 victims' survivors said they had no alternative but to try to take part in the settlement process. `` You have a lot of feelings of anger, resentment, helplessness and torture to see this sort of haggling,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Recker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, whose brother, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dombronski </PERSON>, died in the crash. `` I think it's obscene for one person to put a price tag on another human being. `` It's cruel to the survivors and the memory of the person, but that's the way our legal system works,'' she said. `` There could never be enough dollars in the world to give me back what I want,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Polec </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemens </LOCATION>, whose pregnant daughter and son-in-law died in the crash. `` But that is the only recourse I have right now. `` I feel that if the family does not institute a lawsuit, they are forgiving -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and patting them on the back,'' she said.

 Hundreds of farmers and students burned a figure representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and battled riot police Sunday in a demonstration against American agricultural imports, it was reported. The clashes, in which at least seven policemen were injured, began in the southern city of <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency.

<HEAD>Sir Sacheverell Sitwell Dies Aged 90</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON>, poet, art critic and last of the <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> trio of literary siblings, has died at the age of 90, his son said. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> said his father died Saturday at his home, <ORGANIZATION> Weston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Towcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northamptonshire </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> and his eccentric brother and sister, Sir <PERSON> Osbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON>, were for nearly 50 years the first family of British literature. They were regarded as the spearhead of the avant-garde during the 1920s, when they were known as the `` stormy petrels'' of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> scene. All three were prolific writers and gathered around them some of the most talented and creative people of the time. Composer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> lived in their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment for many years. He wrote music to accompany <PERSON> Edith </PERSON>'s public readings of her poetry and composed `` Belshazzar's Feast'' in the stables at <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. `` He made such a frightful din on the piano we had to banish him from the house,'' <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> once said. The <ORGANIZATION> Sitwells </ORGANIZATION> organized the 1919 exhibition of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> art that introduced <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON> to the British public. They were parodied by <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>, and their long-nosed, patrician faces invited caricature. <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> was born Nov. 15, 1897, the youngest child of the Fourth Baronet <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> and descendant of the Saxon earls of <LOCATION> Northumberland </LOCATION>. His first work was published in 1924 and over the next 56 years he produced 50 volumes of poems and at least 40 other books on travel, music, art and architecture. While his brother delighted in scandalizing literary circles with his exhibitionism, and his equally famous sister became renowned for her eccentricity of dress, <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> preferred to spend his time traveling. He said in 1982 that he had fulfilled a desire of his youth to see every beautiful place and thing in the world. He rated the Italian city of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> first and the temples of Angkor Wat in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> second. In 1987, writer <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> called Sir <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> `` an 18th century gentleman who has seen all the world's masterpieces of art, visited its most beautiful countries, read its books, collected its stories, meditated on its curiosities.'' In 1950, <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> wrote the famous <PERSON> Atticus </PERSON> column in the Sunday Times for 10 months, commenting on amusing events in life around him. In 1981, the anonymous author of the column at the time interviewed him and quoted him as saying about himself and his siblings: `` We are undervalued. Obscurity is descending and the only honor that I have received is the freedom of the city of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> for giving a lecture on <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>. But I am modestly confident about my long-term fame.'' <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON> biographer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> said in 1969, `` Of the three, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Osbert </PERSON> acquired the greatest fame but there is no doubt that Sir <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> was an extremely gifted writer and towards the end of the 20's he wrote poetry that was quite outstanding.'' <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> died in 1964. When Sir <PERSON> Osbert </PERSON> died five years later, <PERSON> Sacheverell </PERSON> became the Sixth Baronet <PERSON> Sitwell </PERSON>. He continued to write until the death of his wife, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, in 1980 after nearly 56 years of marriage. They had two sons and several grandchildren.

 More than 5,000 Gurkha activists surrendered weapons in northeastern <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state Sunday, ending their two-year struggle for a separate state, government-owned television said. The surrender took place in Darjeeling city, headquarters of the <LOCATION> Gurkha </LOCATION> movement, to coincide with the anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Gurkha </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Subhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghising </PERSON> said on the television news bulletin. More than 1.4 million Gurkhas, who are Indian citizens of Nepalese descent, live in the tea-growing Darjeeling region in northeastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Darjeeling is 670 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Ghising's <ORGANIZATION> Gurkha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> began seeking a separate state within the Indian union in April 1986, saying the Gurkha culture and identity required protection. At least 300 people have died in the rebellion.

 Sixteen killer whales stranded on a remote beach on the south coast of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were destroyed Sunday after veterinarians decided they would not survive a rescue attempt. The whales were spotted off the coast Sunday morning, the day after volunteers saved 32 whales that had been beached nearby. The whales were shot after veterinarians, flown in by helicopter, examined them. The other 32 whales became stranded Thursday. After a two-day operation involving hundreds of volunteers, the whales were returned to the water Saturday evening. A helicopter sent early Sunday to check that they had not stranded themselves again spotted the second group beached high on a stretch of coast inaccessible to vehicles. Wildlife officers believe both groups may have been part of a much larger pod forced by heavy storms last week to shallow water, where their navigational systems may have become confused.

 <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ignatius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> celebrated 40 years of existence in a poor neighborhood Sunday as church leaders pledged to fight an archdiocese proposal that would close it and 42 other inner-city churches. Parishioners marked the anniversary with Mass, a brunch, clowns to entertain the few children and red balloons printed with the ironic theme of the long-planned celebration, `` Life Begins at 40.'' The church was named Wednesday as one of 43 to be closed, dealing another blow to a decaying city losing people, business and institutions. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> would disband and merge with a church 10 blocks away. The shakeup affects nearly 8,000 Roman Catholics belonging to the churches, which are all in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> except for one, in <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, a suburb. Parishioners said the decision appears to contradict what the church recently asked parishes to emphasize _ ministry to the poor, sick and elderly. The Rev. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Helinski </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignatius </LOCATION>, concluded Mass by saying he has responded to the archdiocese's proposal with a letter of appeal. `` We are disappointed with the report,'' <PERSON> Helinski </PERSON> said, quoting the letter. `` We find it inconsistent with previous archdiocese directives.'' <PERSON> Helinski </PERSON> said he and other parishioners `` strenuously object'' to the proposal and will meet Monday with leaders of the other affected churches to mount a campaign against the proposal. The announcement, detailed by Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, followed four years of study of urban parishes by a task force led by <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>. The task force found that 43 of the city's 112 churches are n't viable. `` There were many that I thought were thriving parishes but when you looked at the total picture that was not true,'' <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ignatius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION>, charged that the task force never looked closely at the parish or gave it an opportunity to defend itself. Mrs. <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON> said churches were given only two weeks to appeal. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Federspiel </PERSON>, who was secretary at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignatius </LOCATION> for 20 years, said she hates to hear that the church is closing, but she watched its decline and anticipated the announcement. She moved away a few years ago after her house was broken into. `` There used to be 1,400 parishioners here; now there are maybe 300,'' she said. `` You see what the neighborhood is like around here with the burned-out houses and you ca n't blame people for moving away.'' Parishioner <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could n't count the number of times her house or garage has been broken into, but she stayed in the house where she raised five children. A member of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> for 37 -LCB- years, she said she feels sorrow and anger that it will have to merge. `` These people need a church,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` There are too many members who belong who are not going to be able to get to St. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s.'' Her granddaughter, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pikarski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION>, said the impoverished neighborhood needs the positive influence of the church. `` The people feel like they have been let down,'' she said. `` Sunday Mass is the only time some of them have fellowship with other people.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> on Sunday overwhelmingly defeated a challenge for his job by leftist <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> and appeared certain to use the victory to increase his efforts to moderate the socialist party. In a ballot at the start of the opposition party's annual conference, <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> received 88 percent of the votes of an electoral college composed of labor union leaders, legislators and local party branches. <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member and doyen of the British radical left, smiled wryly and bowed his head as more than 1,000 delegates in the Winter Gardens conference center in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort cheered <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersly </PERSON>, also defeated a bid by two leftists, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffer </PERSON>, to unseat him. He won on the first ballot with a 66 percent majority. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> hailed the results as a `` great honor and a great trust.'' He is bent on pushing Labor toward the center after three successive election defeats by Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> had virtually unanimous backing from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s labor union leaders, who control 40 percent of the electoral college. But he also got majority support from local party branches, which have been traditionally hostile to his leadership, as well as from all but about 35 of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 228 legislators in the 650-member House of Commons. <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, an aristocrat who renounced his title, conceded before the ballot that he had no chance of victory. But he saw his challenge as perhaps the last chance before the next general election, which must be held by 1992, to stop what he regards as a betrayal of socialism as <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> seeks to adapt to changes wrought by nearly a decade of <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government. `` There has been a very substantial drift, if not a rout, to the right in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> told reporters. He said <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> has `` virtually repudiated'' socialism. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s main aim at the weeklong convention is to push through a wide-ranging policy review that dumps some of the left-wing's most cherished principles The review drops previous commitments to renationalize state-owned industries sold by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and accepts some of her union-curbing laws. It was begun after <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s third successive defeat by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in 1987. Labor lost power to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in 1979. <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>'s campaign reopened divisions in the party. It also helped push <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> into reaffirming this summer Labor's vote-losing commitment to scrap <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons unilaterally and to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases in the country. The nuclear issue is due to be included in the second stage of the review at the 1989 conference. A Market Opinion and <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> poll for the pro-Thatcher <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> showed the Conservatives with 44 percent support and Labor at 39 percent. The poll of 1,885 voters put support for the two rival center parties, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, at eight and six percent respectively. However, a National Opinion Poll for the Mail on Sunday, another pro-Thatcher <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weekly, showed two-thirds of the 1,649 voters surveyed thought it was unlikely <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would win the next election. In a Gallup poll for the pro-Conservative <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, only one-fourth of 1,003 voters questioned said they believed <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> will form a majority government in the next 10 years.

<HEAD>White Teen Challenged Blacks Before Shooting, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A white teen-ager challenged a group of blacks in a car shortly before he was pulled into the car and shot, but police said Sunday there was no apparent link to other recent incidents of racial tension. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> said `` What's your problem, boy?'' to the blacks, one of whom apparently had been shooting a gun into the air as the group drove down the street, an 18-year-old companion said. The shooting occurred about a mile from the Hot Biscuit Restaurant, where a black was killed in August in what police called a racially motivated shooting _ one of two shootings which led to riots by blacks last month. However, police downplayed the idea that Saturday's shooting was race-related. <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> was reported in satisfactory condition Sunday at <LOCATION> Willis-Knighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he underwent 4 -LCB- hours of surgery. The <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified friend of <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> as saying that the gunman also turned a handgun on him and pulled the trigger, but the gun apparently was empty. `` It just went click,'' the companion said. The Times quoted unidentified witnesses Sunday as saying one of the attackers said `` Remember the Hot Biscuit'' _ an apparent reference to the August restaurant killing. Last month, a white woman shot and killed a black in what police said was a drug deal gone sour. That shooting, plus the restaurant shooting, sparked two days of riots in a predominantly black neighborhood of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. `` Nothing in the investigation to date has produced any information that the shooting was solely a racial incident, and no ties to any of the recent past incidents was uncovered,'' said a police statement about <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON>' shooting. Officers on duty Sunday said they had no further information. There have been no arrests and police said the investigation was continuing. Community leaders said they did not know the reason for the shooting and hoped that it was an isolated incident. `` But if this is a racial incident, it is just another sign of how much frustration and how much anger is in a portion of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>'s population that has been left out of so much,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker-Jack </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Black-White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> chapter, said the reported use of the term `` boy,'' which has in the past been a racial insult, had lost much of its sting. `` Certainly among my peers, ` boy' is a term used affectionately among the races now ...,'' English said. `` Somehow, I can not see that invoking anger as it would have 20 years ago.'' `` I know that it's not serious enough to warrant the type of reaction that obviously took place,'' he said. `` I think the youngsters in this community are simply reaction to the atmosphere in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> right now.'' The boy's parents said they were shocked that their son would be involved in an interracial incident. `` <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> has a lot of black friends. He's easygoing but he wo n't let anyone push him around,'' said his father, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> `` He just happened to be there.'' Police said boy was in a group of young people who were walking down the street early Saturday morning when the car full of young blacks drove by. `` A pop was heard,'' according to the police report. <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON>' friend told the Times that he did n't realize it at the time, but the sound apparently was a gun being fired into the air <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> called out to the car, and it stopped and he went over to it, police said. `` A challenge was issued, at which time several black males got out of the vehicle and a fistfight ensued,'' the police statement said. <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON>' friend told the Times that <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> `` ran up to the car and said, ` What's your problem, boy?''' Both police and the witness said a passenger in the back seat grabbed <PERSON> Spillers </PERSON> and pulled him into the car, where they grappled. `` When I caught up with the car, that's when I heard the gun go off,'' the witness told the newspaper. He said he was also shot at, but the gun was apparently empty at that point.

 The Republican congressman elected last spring to fill Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s unexpired term defeated the governor's mother in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s primary election, and another <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member faces a repeat of a 1986 runoff. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and another candidate Saturday to win his first full term to represent the 4th District in northwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. But Rep. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> will meet <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a Democrat he beat in a 1986 runoff, on Nov. 8 in another runoff for the 8th District. Under <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s open primary system, all candidates run in a unified primary, regardless of party affiliation. If a candidate does not receive a majority, the top two meet in a runoff. With all of the votes tallied, Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> joined <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> in claiming victories without runoffs. Republican <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the 6th District and Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> in the 7th District, both freshmen, were unopposed. Only 32 percent of the state's registered voters participated, below the original prediction of 38 to 42 percent, the secretary of state's office said. Election officials had said the opening of squirrel hunting season and a televised <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> football game would keep many voters away. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' margin of victory in the 2nd District's 1986 race was larger than the total number of voters who showed up Saturday. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> had 63,327 votes or 90 percent, while Republican opponent <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` Captain'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had 7,665 votes or 10 percent. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> has held the seat since winning a special election in 1973 to replace her husband, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, who died in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON> had 58,479 votes or 44 percent to 44,904 or 34 percent for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a black lawyer. Three other Democrats _ state Sen. J.E. <PERSON> Jumonville </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Tillie'' <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> _ trailed far behind. All of the challengers are Democrats. Turnout was 25 percent below 1986. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> won with 72,128 votes or 69 percent to 27,829 or 27 percent for Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, a retired military officer, had 5,103 votes or 5 percent. Both challengers are Democrats. In the April election to fill <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s unexpired term, the Democratic governor supported <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, a former congressional aide, and raised the ire of state Democrats. But <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>'s conservative voting record did n't set well with the governor's mother, who charged that he was ignoring the plight of the majority of his constituency, women, blacks and blue collar workers. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> called <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> an honorable man and a friend. `` I think because of this campaign he'll be more aware and I hope to work with him,'' she said. The only constitutional proposition on the ballot, a proposed tax break for owners who improve residential property occupied by low - and moderate-income families, was turned down 65 percent to 35 percent

 Three Haitian soldiers could face deportation or long prison terms for forcing their way aboard a New York-bound jetliner in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in a quest for political asylum, authorities said Sunday. The three, arrested Saturday night when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 658 arrived at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, will appear Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on air piracy charges. The soldiers had surrendered their rifles and pistols before the airplane left the capital city of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. There were no shots fired, and no one was injured during the incident. The soldiers, identified as <PERSON> Edouine </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mormil </PERSON>, 23; and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlston </PERSON> <PERSON> Beinamie </PERSON>, 23, were being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. The key to their fate will turn on the question of whether they were victims or victimizers in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The question is: Are they worthy of refugee protection? ... Are they merely fugitives from justice or are they refugees from persecution?'' <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office were unable to provide any details Sunday about the men's motives or background. A <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> detective said Saturday night that the men were concerned about a `` communist takeover'' of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Although there has been turmoil in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in recent weeks, it generally has not been attributed to communists. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> was installed as president of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> on Sept. 17 following a coup by lower-ranking soldiers that led to the ouster of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. The coup triggered a military uprising that led to the ouster of military commanders loyal to <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship that preceded him. Airport employees at the <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> said the soldiers slipped under a wire fence that surrounds the airport. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucicault </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, said: `` Three soldiers on duty entered at the end of the line of passengers with a determined air. We could not refuse their entrance. As a result of negotiation, they deposited all their arms, pistols and rifles, in the pilot's cabin.'' The soldiers were arrested without incident when the Airbus A300, with 224 passengers and nine crew members, arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They intended no harm to anyone, there was no threat of violence,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said after the plane landed. `` They just said they wanted to leave <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said the men could face maximum sentences of 20 years to life in prison if convicted of air piracy. The men can expect to be tried before their application for political asylum is considered, said <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>. He said the request for asylum could be granted even if the men are convicted, assuming they can prove that they acted out of desperation. However, if they are shown to have been perpetrators of violence in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, they could be deported following their conviction, <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> said. Another possibility is that the Haitian government would seek to extradite the men. Such a request would be considered before a trial was held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A college student wounded by a woman who went on a shooting rampage at an elementary school said Sunday he favors tighter controls on handgun ownership, but not a ban on the weapons. `` I know people who handle guns responsibly and I do n't have a problem with that,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, 21, of suburban <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, before leading a march against handgun violence. But <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> said restrictions on who can get guns could have prevented <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> from embarking on her May 20 attack. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> killed one child and wounded five at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> before bursting into <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s nearby home, shooting him and fatally shooting herself. `` If someone using psychiatric drugs was not allowed to own a gun, the <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> incident could have been prevented,'' he said. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was using an experimental drug used to control behavior problems. She had carried three guns into the school. `` This is something I live with every day,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, who was shot in the chest. `` I hope people realize these incidents can be prevented.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a senior at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> who plans to go to law school, led a group of about 100 people, many of whom were relatives or friends of victims killed by handguns, on the eighth annual five-mile Walk Against Handgun Violence sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>. Many people marching Sunday advocated total handgun bans. `` Handguns have got to be banned,'' said <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Silas </PERSON>, whose 22-year-old son, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Upchurch </PERSON>, was killed in February, leaving a widow and two small children. `` I never want to see a family go through this. It's awful. It's every parent's nightmare. `` Can you imagine the trauma it put on my family to have my son gunned down on the street?'' she asked. `` You do n't know the nightmares I've had and the nights I've spent up wondering what would have happened if I'd been there. It hurts. It really hurts.'' Many of the marchers carried signs calling for the elimination of handguns while others had placards bearing more personal messages. One youngster carried a sign saying `` I was Daddy's little girl before someone shot him.'' `` This is an opportunity for these people to reflect on the violence against their loved ones and on life,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive director of the 3,000-member organization that sponsored the walk. `` We want the families to see this as something positive that can come out of tragedy.'' At a Grant Park rally before the march, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> thanked people for the support he has received since he was shot. `` I hope we all can continue to work for what's possible and remember the tragedies and work to prevent them from happening again,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overhaul of the power structure, his assumption of the presidency and the ouster of key officials dominated the Soviet media on Sunday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, was named president Saturday to replace the 79-year-old <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, uniting the top party and government jobs in one man. Reports from Saturday's session of the Supreme Soviet, or national parliament, took up the entire front page of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda and other national papers on Sunday, and half of the second page. Many of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s predecessors, including <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>, had held both the top party and government jobs, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declined to follow the model when he took power in March 1985. Instead, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, the veteran foreign minister was moved up to the largely ceremonial job from which he retired on Saturday. He received a resounding ovation in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses from the 1,500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet, who voted unanimously to accept his resignation and elect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged in a speech that the soviets, or governing councils, would become more important as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> withdraws from day-to-day management and concentrates on setting policy. `` The soviets must become the highest authority on their territory and eliminate the shortcomings of stagnation,'' he said. `` The party will facilitate the enhancement of the role of the soviets.'' Among other changes announced, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON>, a candidate member of the ruling Politburo, lost his job as a first deputy prime minister and was sent as ambassador to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the trade bloc of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies. <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON> was named in 1985 to be the head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for the centrl management of the Soviet economy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has sharply criticized the central management system, demanding that it give local officials more autonomy. <PERSON> Talyzin </PERSON> was replaced as planning chief by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> in February and transfered to the little-known <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The action was a further demotion and made it likely he would be removed from the Politburo in the future. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biryukova </PERSON> enhanced her status as the highest-ranking woman in the party hierarchy during the two days of meetings of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Supreme Soviet. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made her a candidate member of the Politburo, the first woman on that body since the time of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. She was relieved of her responsibility for light industry in a revamped <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> apparatus and gave up her position as a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The following day the Supreme Soviet named her a deputy prime minister. In the two days of meetings, a new <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON>, was named and former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> was transferred to responsibility for legal affairs in the Central Committee. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> retired long-time Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, and two candidate members, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pyotor </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON>, who had served as vice president.

 More than 3,500 residents of Nitro will be evacuated next week while a cylinder of deadly hydrogen cyanide from a closed chemical plant is destroyed, a federal official said Sunday. Nitro's mayor complained Sunday that he is being left in the dark on plans. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s on-scene coordinator at the <ORGANIZATION> Artel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, said three specialists from <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will remove and blow up the container, believed to contain up to 30 pounds of the chemical, next Sunday. `` We're still firming up the details,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` But it will go just as planned before. We've gotten over the insurance and liability issues.'' Destruction of the chemical had been planned for Sept. 25, but was canceled because of those issues. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes the cyanide compound, a basic feedstock for some chemical products, is becoming unstable and in danger of exploding on its own. It can be fatal if inhaled or absorbed directly, but it can be destroyed by burning when released from the cylinder. Nitro Mayor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said Sunday that he learned of the new date Friday but has n't heard a word from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` My office is right in the hot zone,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said. `` You'd think they'd let me know about these things I have n't talked to anyone from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> since Sept. 22. I'm not that hard to find.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said Nitro residents are uneasy because they do n't know what's taking place at the plant the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has labeled a `` potential emergency'' and has placed on the list of Superfund cleanup sites. Last Monday, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> held a news conference to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for its handling of the situation. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said he was waiting for the controversy to diminish before talking to <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>. `` I want to set up a meeting and talk to the mayor early this week,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` I told him before the last scheduled evacuation that we would schedule a meeting.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> angered local officials when it canceled the Sept. 25 evacuation just two days before the event. O.H. Materials backed out at the last minute because it wanted help from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cyanamid </ORGANIZATION>, the company that made the cylinder. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said Cyanamid refused to cooperate because of insurance and liability problems. Since Nitro, a town of some 8,000 people about 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, is located in both <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> counties, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said it's tough coordinating two county sheriffs' offices, a police station and the state police. He said it's also difficult getting the residents to move. `` The people in this area are accustomed to living around a chemical industry,'' he said. But <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said it's important that the residents are evacuated because `` there's a risk that something may happen and cyanide may go off the site.'' Jet Research workers will move the cylinder 320 feet to an bunker, attach two small explosive charges and blast open the canister to release and burn off the cyanide. The dangerous part is when workers carry the cylinder to the bunker. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said the chemical could have formed into both a solid and a liquid that could mix and explode. If the cyanide reacts, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said workers will have about 60 to 90 seconds to get away. Federal officials took over the closed plant after a roof collapsed on leaking drums whose contents were not all identified. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> crews have counted more than 3,400 drums that must be identified and disposed of.

<HEAD>Methodist Pastor Disappears With Wife And Stepchildren</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LADYSMITH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court has issued a felony warrant for a Methodist pastor who disappeared in August with his wife and stepchildren after his wife lost custody of the children. When the Rev. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, he left a handwritten letter to church members admitting his action was illegal but saying it was necessary if his wife was to keep her children. <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, are now wanted on felony warrants for interfering with a custody order issued for her two children from her previous marriage. They could face up to two years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine if convicted. Authorities said <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, 7, and his sister, <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON>, 4, were not returned to Ms. <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>' ex-husband, <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, after their summer visitation with the Lueckes ended Aug. 14. Two weeks earlier, an appeals court had upheld the awarding of custody to <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>. In his letter to church members, <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON> pleaded for understanding. `` What we are doing is illegal. That bothers me, and I'm sure many would disapprove on that basis alone,'' he wrote. `` But what the courts have done to <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and her children is immoral and wrong, and so we had to choose and take a stand: accept what is immoral and wrong or do something that is illegal ourselves.'' <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON> was married with three children of his own and was pastor at <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> when he and his wife became friends with the Weathers couple. According to court records, <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON> concluded in 1985 that his wife had begun a romantic relationship with <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON>. Both couples subsequently divorced, and <PERSON> Luecke </PERSON> eventually resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, married <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> and became a Methodist minister. In 1987, he was named pastor for three Methodist churches in <LOCATION> Rusk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. After a lengthy legal battle, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> awarded <PERSON> Lindell </PERSON> custody of the two <ORGANIZATION> Weathers </ORGANIZATION> children, saying that either he or his ex-wife would be good parents but described <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s new husband, the pastor, as `` a liar, a cheat -LRB- and -RRB- a shirker of his own family responsibilities.'' Two weeks before the couple and the children disappeared, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>'s custody decision. <LOCATION> Washburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he sympathizes with <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON> but is unable to undertake a nationwide search until there is evidence the fleeing couple has left <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` It almost obsesses you,'' said <PERSON> Weathers </PERSON>, a nursing home administrator in <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an unbelievable thing to go through, from this end, so I ca n't imagine what its like for the kids.''

<HEAD>Shelters Evict 1,000 In Pay Dispute With City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 20 private shelters evicted at least 1,000 homeless people when contract negotiations with the city ended without an agreement, officials said Sunday. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, director of homeless programs for the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said all those evicted Saturday had been relocated by Sunday afternoon She said the city would sever ties with the shelter operators who evicted the men, women and children. `` People had a place to sleep and dinner last night,'' Ms. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. `` Whatever happens here -LRB- in the negotiations -RRB-, no one will go without a place to sleep or something to eat.'' The city contracts with private shelter operators to provide services for the homeless. Negotiations ended late Friday without a new contract. Operators of about 20 shelters had told their residents Friday that they would have to leave the next morning. `` A lot of people did n't want to go,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krishna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> program, which houses about 150 people in two shelters. `` We're very upset that we had to deal like this, to use these people as a bargaining chip. It's a disgrace. We did n't want to, but we were forced to.'' Ms. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said more than 30 shelters involved in the contract dispute remained open. Those evicted represent about one-fifth of the people living in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> shelters, she said. Under the expired contract, the city paid shelters $ 13 a day, with a cap of $ 284 a month, for each homeless person. The contract expired June 30, but both sides agreed to a 90-day extension, which expired Saturday.

<HEAD>Bentsen Holds Mock Debate in Preparation for Debate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> held his first mock debate Sunday in preparation for his matchup Wednesday with Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and then flew to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for final preparations. `` It's really the second presidential debate,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential campaign manager, underscoring the importance the ticket places on the event. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> headed up a cadre of top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides helping <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> get ready. `` I have a lot of confidence in Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a very effective debater,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said, downplaying expectations that the more senior <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is an odds-on favorite. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> held his first rehearsal session in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel Sunday morning, and then flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser. He planned to stay in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> until Tuesday evening, when the campaign planned a rally for his departure to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, the debate site. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, is playing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the mock sessions, and described Sunday's practice as informal. But he said he scored some points against <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ sending staff hurrying to fill gaps in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s briefing book. `` I think it's a grievous mistake'' for anyone to underestimate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s ability to perform well in the 90-minute television session, said <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, who has been intensely studying the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, including reviewing hours of video tapes. `` I think Wednesday night is playing on <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home court,'' said <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>. `` Home course,'' quipped <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s frequent golf outings. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, who sat through Sunday's mock session, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared uncomfortable. `` He does not seem relaxed,'' he said. `` If it were the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor he'd be very comfortable and if it were the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules he would be very comfortable,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is concerned about the fact that the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is telegenic, while the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does n't feel he's good before the cameras, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. One of the goals of the final debate preparation was to get <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> comfortable with the format of the debate _ 90 minutes of questions, two-minute answers and one-minute responses. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said he and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> were playing reporters for the session. `` We slammed him hard from beginning to end,'' he said, declining to reveal any of the questions raised. Despite the seriousness of the effort, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said it was not without humor. After a while, people started noticing an oil painting in the rehearsal room depicting an old English hunting scene. `` It was determined that they were ` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' hunting,'' he said.

<HEAD>Voters Choose Regional Councillors In Record Low Turnout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French voters, in a record low turnout for a national election, chose members of regional councils Sunday, giving slightly more votes to leftist parties than to the right. But the results of the runoff elections _ following a first round of voting last week _ appeared to leave an alliance of conservative parties with control of 70 out of the 101 councils. The right lost only the <LOCATION> Gironde </LOCATION> department in southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to the Socialists. Although previous regional elections have been seen as tests of popular opinion of the national leadership, the current government of Socialist Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> has been in power only since June and its standing did not appear to be at stake in Sunday's voting With about 80 percent of the vote counted, several polling organizations cited by French television estimated the overall turnout at 48 percent of those eligible. That is the lowest since World War II, unofficially breaking the record of 49 percent set last week in the first round of regional elections. The Socialists had 39 percent of the popular vote, the Communists 9 percent and other leftist candidates 3 percent. Various conservative parties split up about 48 percent of the vote. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, whose presidential candidate <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> won 14 percent of the vote in May, got less than 1 percent. All but 13 of its candidates were eliminated in the first round and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called on his supporters to stay home Sunday rather than vote for other conservative parties. There were about 14 million eligible voters. One-half of the council seats come up for election every three years. Voters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> are not involved because the capital's municipal council plays the role of a regional council. Elsewhere in the country there are both municipal and regional councils. Once almost totally powerless, the councils have gained new duties but remain little-known, their activities rarely making the news.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc said Sunday it was looking into reports that the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> used electronic eavesdropping equipment to spy on its rival. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that a listening device with a 500-yard range was found in Likud headquarters in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Arza </PERSON> <PERSON> Ankler </PERSON> denied the report. But the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> was worried after <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> admitted it hired two former senior officials of the Shin Bet security service, <PERSON> Peleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Radai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Malka </PERSON>. According to the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Radai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Malka </PERSON> were hired to spy on <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. The two men were dismissed from the service in 1986 after exposing the `` Shin Bet Affair'' in which security agents fabricated evidence to conceal their role in the 1984 beating deaths of two Palestinians captured after hijacking an Israeli passenger bus. <PERSON> Radai </PERSON> was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying allegations that he and <PERSON> Malka </PERSON>, now of the private <PERSON> Shafran </PERSON> security firm, were spying on the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> were a `` despicable lie.'' Four Israeli dailies, however, quoted <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON> as saying `` there are signs of an Israeli Watergate, for which Labor is responsible.'' Neither Radai or <PERSON> Malka </PERSON> could be reached Sunday to comment on the charges. On Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Ankler </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> `` is not accusing anyone. But we are checking everything and will eventually publish our findings.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> strongly denied the reports on alleged spying. `` We have never used illegal methods and shall not violate the law,'' said Labor spokeswoman <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` We are not dealing in any form of espionage and are not planting microphones.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Malka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Radai </PERSON> but said their job was limited to securing the safety of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s data banks and installations. She said the former agents also `` check people we interview in our election campaign broadcasts. We want these people to be genuine Labor supporters and not those who later show up on Likud broadcasts.'' The Likud and Labor, headed by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, are the two key parties competing in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 parliamentary elections, which are expected to focus on the future of the occupied territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has held since 1967. Sunday marked the start of a 30-day period in which candidates are banned from appearing on state-run <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television or from speaking on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> armed forces radio. The ban does not include newspapers. Later this month, however, parties will be given free broadcast time for special campaign programs. Time is allocated according to the number of seats each party has in the parliament.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of horn-honking, flag-festooned cars, trucks and buses filled with supporters of military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> jammed a boulevard Sunday in support of his continued rule. The noisy caravan represented the final campaign event before Wednesday's referendum on whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15-year-old regime should be extended eight more years. Law required that all political activity halt midnight Sunday. After the Pinochet rally, small groups opposed to the president took to the streets, some waving banners and chanting `` He's going to fall.'' Police broke up some demonstrations with tear gas and water cannons and arrested dozens of people, police reports said. The state-operated television station reported 10 people injured, two seriously, in isolated incidents throughout the day, including some street clashes between government supporters and opponents. As night approached, a heavy police presence was evident downtown. Riot squads in buses and trucks equipped with tear gas and water cannons cruised the nearly empty streets. The pro-government rally Sunday was by far the biggest demonstration of support for the right-wing 72-year-old army commander since he and the country's other military chiefs formally proposed on Aug. 30 that he remain president until 1997. Government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said the caravan included more than 30,000 vehicles. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> campaign spokesman, said more than 700,000 people participated, but the figure appeared to be exaggerated. `` Viva Pinochet!'' shouted participants, many of them young people. They filled private cars, flatbed trucks and buses decorated with red, white and blue national flags and posters showing a smiling <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in civilian dress. Loudspeakers atop many vehicles urged a `` yes'' vote in the referendum, while drivers leaned on their horns. At the height of the demonstration, fireworks sailed into the air and exploded. Huge traffic jams formed as vehicles attempted to converge shortly after noon on the government palace in downtown <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a city home to more than a third of the country's 12 million people. By midafternoon, dozens of the vehicles headed to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s private residence in a fashionable <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> neighborhood The president smiled and held a small granddaughter in his arms while flanked by his wife, <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>, and other relatives, appeared briefly at a second-floor balcony to acknowledge the noisy cheering of his supporters. If a majority vote in favor of <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION> on Wednesday, he will begin a new eight-year term in March. If he is rejected, an open election is to be held late next year and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain in office ntil March 1990. In either case, elections for a congress will be held in a year. The legislature was disbanded when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of an President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. A 16-party opposition coalition staged its final campaign rally Saturday, drawing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of middle - and working-class Chileans to a closed-off section of highway several miles south of downtown The government had barred organizers from staging the demonstration closer to the city's center. On Saturday night, a vast blackout struck much of the country. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> was completely without power for about an hour. Authorities blamed the outage on terrorist bombings of three electric power line towers. No one claimed responsibility for the outage.

 <PERSON> Generoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the owner of the National Enquirer who built the weekly newspaper into a successful supermarket tabloid, died Sunday after suffering a heart attack at his home. He was 61. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> was taken to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where he was pronounced dead, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwingle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> native who graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> at age 19, was 25 when he borrowed $ 75,000 to buy the 17,000-circulation weekly <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>. He made it a tabloid, and invented the paper's loud, glitzy style featuring sensational headlines and often bizarre stories. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> had said that the paper evolved when `` I discovered that <PERSON> gore </PERSON> would sell _ gory pictures, gory stories. Circulation now stands at 4.5 million. While the tabloid flourished, its style has many critics and has netted many lawsuits from celebrities over the newspaper's contents Comedienne <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> sued for libel in 1981, winning $ 800,000. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> settled his $ 22 million suit, brought for an article saying he was injected with a youth serum made of fetal sheep cells. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> sued and settled over an article alleging he was in a love triangle. Actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sued over an article alleging her husband drove her to drink.

 Discovery's astronauts delivered a poignant salute Sunday to their fallen Challenger comrades, eulogizing them as fellow sojourners and friends, and saying `` At this moment, our place in the heavens makes us feel closer to them than ever before.'' Said astronaut <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>: `` It's good to be back to where they wanted to go so badly.'' As they beamed down spectacular views of the mottled blue and white Earth miles below, the Discovery astronauts spoke about the Challenger _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last manned space venture _ which exploded on liftoff 32 months ago tragically killing school teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> and six others. `` Those on the Challenger who had flown before and seen these sights, they would know the meaning of our thoughts,'' said astronaut <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` Those who had gone to view them for the first time, they would know why we set forth.'' Discovery is to return home from its four-day, one-hour, 65-orbit flight Monday, landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at 12:37 p.m. EDT. The shuttle will be greeted there by an expected 100,000 or more people, including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who will be waiting at the foot of the ramp when the astronauts climb down. The weather looked fine for landing and thousands were camped there already on Sunday. The astronauts may be a bit warm on their 10,000-mile glide home; a cooling system problem has plagued most of the flight may still not be working. Gathered in the Discovery's miToday, up here where the blue sky turns to black,'' said commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, `` we can say at long last to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and El, and to <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON>: `` Dear friends, we have resumed the journey that we promised to continue for you. Dear friends, your loss has meant that we could confidently begin anew. Dear friends, your spirit and your dreams are still alive in our heart.'' The seven who died aboard Challenger were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scobee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnik </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>. In a 20-minute news conference with reporters gathered in a Mission Control auditorium, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> praised Discovery's performance, saying `` I'm not sure that we've had a mission that has been this trouble-free with an orbiter before.'' Lounge was asked what he would say to the two presidential candidates to convince them to support the space program. He answered it this way: `` This is a very important flight simply because it's the first step. I would hope that all of the enthusiasm that we've seen throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if we're going to make this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to to get us on the path to the future.'' Sunday was pack-up day for the astronauts. After the news conference they set about the task of stowing the dozen scientific experiment and other gear they used in the flight. Early Monday, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> will fire the shuttle's two huge steering engines to slow the craft so it will glide, unpowered, halfway around the world toward the desert runway at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. `` Many emotions well up in our hearts, joy for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s return to space, gratitude for our nation's support through difficult times, thanksgiving for the safety of our crew, reverence for those whose sacrifice made our journey possible,'' astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> said. And Lounge said: `` Gazing outside, we can understand why mankind has looked toward the heavens with awe and wonder since the dawn of human existence. We can comprehend why our countrymen have been driven to explore the vast expanse of space and we are convinced that this is the road to the future, the road that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must travel if we are to maintain the dream of our Constitution to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' As part of the buttoning-up exercise, the astronauts tested flight control systems. They reported no problems as they briefly switched on the auxiliary power units that will control the movement of wing flaps, rudders and speed brakes during re-entry through Earth's atmosphere. They got an early-morning song-and-patter routine that's become a hallmark of the flight. Comedian <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> again did the honors. `` Are you awake yet? Why? Because it's time to eat breakfast through a toothpaste tube,'' said the tape-recorded voice of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> sent into space from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Then, eight undergraduates from <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mudd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, parodied the school's fight song for <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an alumnus. Mimicking the old <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> theme, the group sang: `` H-A-R-V-E-Y, M-U-double D.'' `` There's not a dry eye in the house,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said.

 A broken coupling on a roller coaster made the ride screech to a halt in the middle of a loop and trapped 20 people upside down for more than an hour, less than a week after it passed an inspection, an official said Sunday. `` They were up there upside down, waving their arms, just hanging there,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Vangroski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hazleton </LOCATION>. `` They started to panic a little bit. Being upside down for that period of time is scary.'' Officials originally said 45 people were trapped but revised the figure to 20. At least 12 people were treated at hospitals for dizziness and other minor injuries and released after Saturday's mishap at the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. The Super Loops ride had been passed by state inspectors Tuesday, after a worn-out wheel discovered by the ride owner's own inspectors was replaced, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON>, director of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rides </ORGANIZATION> The ride is owned by Florida-based Reithoffer Rides, which had 35 of the 45 rides at the fair. The ride's cars ride inside a single large vertical loop, and are attached to and pulled along by a flexible inner loop, <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said. The broken coupling attached a car to the inner loop. Passengers are held in their seats by lap and safety bars, and a safety cage runs the entire length of the train. <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said rescue workers had to move the train from more than 50 feet off the ground slowly to the bottom of the loop to remove the passengers. He said his office would contact the ride manufacturer Monday to find out whether similar problems had been reported elsewhere. <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said he has not heard of any prior problems with the Super Loops ride, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> LMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A state police spokesman said about 100,000 attended the fair Saturday, the last night of the agricultural exhibition and carnival. The Loops ride was dismantled early Sunday after the scheduled closing. The ride was inspected last Monday by state-certified Reithoffer inspectors, according to <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON>. He said the inspectors found a worn-out wheel, but state inspectors confirmed Tuesday that the wheel had been replaced. `` Everything was right up to par,'' <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said. According to the state's Amusement Ride Inspection Act, passed in 1984 after several accidents on traveling carnival rides in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, all rides must be inspected every time they are set up. Results of the operator's inspections must be filed with <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said state inspectors also conduct spot inspections to ensure that the state's standards are met. A preliminary investigation did not indicate any wrongdoing, <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON> said.

 The teen-ager whose letter was read in space by Discovery commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> says the experience has taught him at least one thing: `` I'll do my homework a little more often.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 14, wrote to <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> last May as an assignment for his eighth-grade science class at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Sheepshead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>.

I feel that some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future is riding on you and your crew's shoulders I give you all the inspiration I can give you because your ride this fall means so much to me.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> interrupted the crew's schedule Saturday to read the letter. He said he hoped it would show young people that `` we are back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that will come in the future.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who is known as <PERSON> P.J. </PERSON>, said Sunday that <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> had eased his worries `` a lot.'' Teacher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON> said he made the assignment to the seventh - and eighth-graders in his earth science class as a way of introducing current events Of the 85 letters he sent, <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>.'s was the only one to draw such a personal response, <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON> said, although other students received autographed pictures from the astronauts. `` I thought the fact they had gotten pictures was great,'' <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON> said, `` But when he read the letter yesterday _ this was unreal.'' As he wrote the letter, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, `` I was thinking about the tragedy of the Challenger and how the Discovery means so much for everybody.''

<HEAD>King Postpones Parliamentary Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> postponed parliamentary elections Sunday, three months after dissolving a legislature in which half the seats are held by representatives of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. A senior official told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` The king wanted to give the government more time'' to change election laws in line with his July decision to cut legal ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Following the July decision, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> suspended the 60-member lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose members represented the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Under the constitution, new elections are supposed to be held within four months of a suspension. But the document says the king can postpone elections if the Cabinet considers them impossible. No nationwide parliamentary elections have been held in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since April 1967. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capture of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> that year made voting there impossible. It was the second time in a year that elections scheduled under the constitution have been postponed. Elections under a revamped voting law had been set for late last year, but the king last year postponed them until at least 1989, saying preparations were not complete. The suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in July triggered a separate constitutional call for a vote, which the king has now postponed. Parliament itself was revived only in 1984 after a decade-long suspension caused in part by the problem of election for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> members.

<TEXT>
 A peace accord has been reached between the Sandinista government and more than 300 members of an Indian guerrilla group, the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. The report in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said 10 military commanders of the <ORGANIZATION> Yatama </ORGANIZATION> group agreed to a cease-fire on Saturday. <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON>, led by <PERSON> Brooklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagot </PERSON>, includes members of several groups of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast Indians who have been fighting the government for more than six years. The Indians began fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> when the government forced them to relocate. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said the truce accord includes provisions for medical and food assistance to 54 war-torn communities of about 50,000 people. It said the former guerrillas retained the right to form self-defense groups but promised to cut their ties with <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON>. Neither <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON> leaders nor Indians who had broken away from the group were available for comment. Cease-fire talks with the Indians began in May, about a month after the U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras reached a temporary truce with the leftist government. The Contras have yet to negotiate a lasting peace agreement with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Yatama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> seek a form of self-government for indigenous tribes along a 75-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seaboard called the Mosquito Coast. They are not part of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella for most Contra organizations. <PERSON> Yatama </PERSON> claims it has 2,000 combatants. But at least 1,000 have surrendered in a series of incidents since last year. The Indian war has stopped for the most part along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The Indian fight against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, marked by factionalism since its beginnings in 1981, started when the leftist government tried to impose authority on the isolated, traditionally independent region. Tens of thousands of Miskito, <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> and Sumo Indians were forced from their tribal lands when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they uncovered a plan to oust government representatives in the jungle-like region. Thousands fled tribal homelands across the winding <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> reported that most have returned home. Nicaraguan Indians also resisted any exercise of authority over them by the rightist, pro-American <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dynasty that ruled for 42 years until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1979.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said Sunday that he believes evil forces are growing in influence worldwide, but the forces of good ultimately will prevail. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, concluding the 158th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints, said that `` not many years hence'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> will return to vanquish all evil. `` I testify that wickedness is rapidly expanding in every segment of our society. It is more highly organized, more cleverly disguised and more powerfully promoted than ever before,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 89, said in remarks prepared for the concluding session of the two-day conference. The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture secretary borrowed the term `` secret combinations'' from the Book of Mormon to characterize the evil forces threatening the world. Secret combinations in Mormon scripture are any set up to acquire power and influence through murder and other unlawful means. `` Secret combinations lusting for power, gain and glory are flourishing,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` A secret combination that seeks to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations and countries is increasing in its evil influence and control over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the entire world.'' Considered the keystone of the Mormon faith, the Book of Mormon was published by church founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in 1830. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he translated the work from gold plates given him by an angel named <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> did not further describe the network to which he referred, but the conservative church leader for decades has been an ardent foe of communism and has characterized it as a godless conspiracy bent on the overthrow of free nations. Mormons believe their 158-year-old church was established by God after all other faiths had sunk into apostacy. The church has 6.5 million members. Other church leaders Sunday sought to counter criticism from other faiths that Mormonism is not a Christian religion, to stress the importance of family life and to implore more older married couples to join the church's 35,700-member missionary force. Elder <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON> said more Mormon couples whose children are grown should consider filling full-time missions. There presently are 1,100 such couples, but there is room for 5,000 more, he said.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> watched the closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games and family members visited his bedside Sunday, one day after a sudden blood loss endangered his fragile health. The 87-year-old <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who fell ill with a fever shortly before vomiting blood from an intestinal hemorrhage on Sept. 19, remained in stable condition early Monday, said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, head of general affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, Crown Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, their 22-year-old son, visited the emperor in his chambers Sunday, the palace said. <PERSON> Aya </PERSON> gave his grandfather a wood carving of a bird, a gift from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the prince is a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was alert and insisted on watching part of the Olympic men's marathon on television. Sunday evening he watched broadcasts of the closing ceremonies from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Reports said the emperor temporarily lost consciousness when he discharged a large amount of blood from his bowels Saturday and his blood pressure plummeted. He revived after doctors gave him emergency blood transfusions. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> continued to lose small amounts of blood Sunday and received another .4 pint in transfusions, bringing the total he has received since the onset of the crisis to 10.2 pints. Palace officials said doctors also administered platelets to thicken his blood, which has thinned after copious transfusions. The emperor has now taken in more blood than the total normally circulating in his body, according to reports. He ran a fever Sunday of about 98.8, higher than his normal 95.9 temperature, the palace said. His temperature fell slightly to 98.6 Monday morning. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s blood pressure also was high at 162 over 70, compared to 160 over 74 the previous day, threatening to strain his heart and worsen internal hemorrhaging A typical normal reading is about 120 over 80. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted palace aides as saying the emperor's jaundice was worsening and his skin was turning yellow Doctors fear his strength is waning dangerously, as intravenous feeding alone can not provide enough nutrients and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has ingested almost no food for two weeks. Court physicians believe the bleeding is coming from the upper intestine, where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> underwent bypass surgery in Sept. 1987 to alleviate pressure on the intestine from an enlarged pancreas. The palace said tissue samples from the pancreas tested negative for cancer, but persistent news reports have said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer of the upper intestine. Palace officials have discouraged such reports, saying they could dishearten the emperor, but have otherwise refused comment. Under the Constitution, the emperor is a symbol of the state with little real power. His duties include receiving foreign dignitaries and placing official seals on government documents.

 More than 1 million people have been left homeless by flooding in eastern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, government officials said. The official government death toll from the flooding was 31 but unofficial reports put it substantially higher. Nearly 2,000 villages were hit by the flooding from heavy rains in mid-September and more than 850,000 acres of land are still under water, reported the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, the ancient <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> capital of 6 million people, remained cut off from most of western and northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Parts of the highway linking <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, had been under water for several days. Army soldiers have been flying over the hardest hit areas and dropping sealed food bags to people still clinging to their roofs to escape the water. Food along with medical supplies were also ferried to stranded residents by motor boat. Officials said at least one million residents were forced to leave their homes. About 42,000 people were vaccinated against typhoid and cholera, <ORGANIZATION> AAP </ORGANIZATION> reported on Saturday. The threat from the <LOCATION> Ravi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chenab </LOCATION> rivers in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province has passed but the <LOCATION> Sutlej </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> flowing west from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> continues to be a problem. Officials said the Sutlej, only a trickle since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> built a dam 30 years ago, has risen dramatially. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the government said last week at least 282 people have died in flash floods that have hit villages in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and the neighboring states of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Himachal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> since Sept. 21.

Now that he has a laptop computer, he computes in the back seat of the car, on the plane, beside the pool and even, he admits, in bed. <PERSON> Obermeier </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is the kind of person who is making laptop models into one of the hottest segments of the computer business. Until recently, laptop computers tended to be underpowered and overpriced, with small, poorly lit screens and batteries that ran out at inconvenient times. Those problems have not been conquered completely, but enough progress has been made to release a flood of pent-up demand among business people, students, writers and others. Sales of laptop computers will surpass $ 1 billion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year and are growing at a rate of 40 percent annually, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a market researcher. This fall, in some ways, marks the coming of age of laptop computers. This week, on Monday and Tuesday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to unveil new models for the laptop market, an industry segment where they have enjoyed some of their greatest success in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which disdained the market until now, is expected to introduce its first laptop model at an Oct. 17 press conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Houston-based company says only that it will announce a `` new dimension'' in personal computing. Finally, analysts say <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will come out soon with a successor to its 2-year-old PC Convertible, a relatively slow machine that has been criticized by computer buffs. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> confirmed that a new laptop is planned but would not say when it would be available. As a sign of the market's importance, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which dominates the government market for laptops, has even managed to make the machines the linchpin of its entire data systems business. `` The laptop market is one that is coming into its own after many years of really being a niche market,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodenberg </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Entre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a retail chain. Laptop computers have always gotten good press, perhaps because journalists were some of their earliest users. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Radio Shack TRS 80 Model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the campaign trail _ the `` Trash 80.'' But people who needed more computing power shied away from them. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON>, a consultant in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said he once destroyed an entire database when he tried to transfer something out of his Radio Shack and exceeded the memory limit. The newest models, in contrast, are loaded with power. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> are both announcing models this week that use <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s top-of-the-line 80386 microprocessor, PC Week newspaper says The problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for electricity and drain batteries quickly. Seizing an opportunity, <ORGANIZATION> Chips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, recently introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of time that many laptops can run on batteries. Prices for laptops are relatively high _ $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 _ because of the expense of the batteries, energy-saving CMOS memory chips and the complex technology of flat screens. The flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell and usually display 25 lines at a time, in comparison to the 40 lines of a regular personal computer. Brightness and contrast, although much improved, still do n't match those of full-sized PCs. Once on the road, laptop owners have abundant headaches: No place to recharge batteries, no modular phone jacks, hotel phone switches that ca n't handle data transmissions, 3 -LCB- - inch disks that are n't compatible with other people's 5 \ Still, something keeps laptop users tapping away. Laptops, like cellular phones, allow people to keep working while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the in-flight magazine. They also encourage spontaneity by letting people record or try out ideas while they are fresh. `` I would say there's like a 150 to 200 percent improvement in my productivity. I ca n't even think with a paper and pencil anymore,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a laptop enthusiast who works in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Hay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based personnel consulting firm. Of course, working through the night on a laptop on a long flight can be bad for one's public image, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON>, a consultant at <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People think you're a workaholic,'' <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON>, nonetheless, is a confirmed laptop user. He even uses it in the office: `` It does everything a regular PC does so I do n't need to have both,'' he said

 <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> built its world around Tagamet, an ulcer drug that did n't face competition for its first eight years and two years ago was the hottest-selling medicine anywhere. Today, that world is being dismantled. Last year, a British company took <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s premier position in the ulcer drug market, leaving the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> pharmaceutical giant with a 25 percent slide in profits for the second quarter of this year. The company was forced last week to announce a restructuring plan that will cost up to $ 400 million and slash about 1,600 jobs. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s problem, industry analysts say, is its lack of new drugs to follow Tagamet's success. `` It's every CEO's nightmare to have a successful product, but no follow-up,'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaly </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> S.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warbug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They were either unlucky or unsmart that they did n't have new products to replace the inevitable decline'' of Tagamet and Dyazide, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION>'s highly successful blood pressure medicine <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` Here we are 24 years later and son of Tagamet has yet to be developed.'' Producing a new drug takes several years of research, animal testing and human trials before it gets the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s approval for sale. Work first began on Tagamet in 1964, 12 years before it was introduced. `` I do n't think they have the horses in the stables at this point to generate growth,'' <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said. Tagamet first hit the British market in 1976 and was introduced in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> a year later. In 1986, the drug set a record for yearly sales of a prescription medication at $ 1.132 billion. But the competition has been able to catch up, with London-based <ORGANIZATION> Glaxo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Zantac beating Tagamet in the ulcer market. Analysts calculate Zantac this year has about 40 percent of the ulcer drug sales, with Tagamet at about 30 to 35 percent. Dyazide, another <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> blockbuster, hit $ 365 million in sales last year. But late in 1987, its first competitor entered the market. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> cited Dyazide's disappointing performance in announcing the second-quarter slide in profits but played down Tagamet's role in the reorganization. `` Tagamet is facing a lot of competition. There's no doubt about it. But if there were less competition and stronger Tagamet sales than there are, I believe we would still be here today talking about these decisions,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, chief executive officer, said at a news conference Tuesday announcing the restructuring. Analysts, however, were skeptical about the stated lack of effect by Tagamet on the situation. Under the restructuring plan, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> said domestic and international drug sales and research, which had been the three main units of the company's drug business, would be consolidated, while a stronger emphasis would be placed on its other major divisions. They include <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, diagnostic tools; <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, eye care, and <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, testing. About 1,600 jobs would be eliminated in the coming years, including 60 percent of the 500-strong corporate staff, the company said. The restructuring carries a price tag of $ 375 to $ 400 million. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> also said it would sell 17 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> in a public offering of 5 million newly issued shares of common stock. <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> hinted at a possible spinoff of other companies as well. The plans were received coolly in the days following the announcement, with the company's stock slipping $ 3 to $ 45.12 -LCB- a share between Tuesday and the close of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading on Friday. The company and analysts expected such public offerings will define a high value for the companies, and, with <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> retaining a majority of the stock, the parent's market value will increase as well. The restructuring will have an impact on earnings beginning in the first three months of next year and yield a savings of about $ 100 million each year by 1990, <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON> said. About 40 percent of restructuring cost will cover the costs of consolidating manufacuring plants in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and research in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, about 40 percent will be taken up by the personnel changes and severance payments and another 20 percent will cover other non-recurring costs associated with the reorganization, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Record Citrus Harvest Shows Recovery In Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Showing signs of recovery, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus growers reaped a record $ 1.3 billion for their fruit during the 1987-88 harvest season ending in July, according to a preliminary report from the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The previous record was $ 1.03 billion in 1979-80, posted before a series of severe freezes slashed the state's top agricultural crop. Orange production reached its highest level since 1983, exports of fresh grapefruit set a record, juice yields were at all-time highs, and the price of <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> oranges, the main juice variety, set a record high at $ 7.86 a 90-pound box. Record prices were caused in part by smaller-than-expected crops in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s main citrus competitor, and by exceptionally strong demand for fresh grapefruit exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> exported a record 10.3 million boxes of grapefruit. `` It was a very good, vintage year,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, citrus statistician for the state and federal crop reporting service based in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. While growers statewide celebrated the numbers, those with trees in the northern growing areas hit hardest by the freezes are still struggling to recover. <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which produced more than 44 million boxes of fruit in 1979-80, yielded only 2.5 million boxes in the most recent season. <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which produced more than 17 million boxes eight years ago, produced 3.1 million. A federal tree census released last week said the state planted a record 125,000 acres of citrus trees in 1986 and 1987, but citrus trees take several years before they yield fruit and almost a decade to reach full production.

 <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> reached a tentative three-year contract agreement over the weekend, opening the way for a resumption of talks between the union and <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The tentative settlement between <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> was announced by <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> at 5:08 a.m. CDT Saturday after 20 hours of bargaining. A threatened widespread strike against <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> was averted with announcement of the agreement. <PERSON> Combs </PERSON> said the agreement would take effect immediately upon ratification by the company's 13,400 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> employees at factories and warehouses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. No date was set for a vote. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the agreement was tentative and `` subject to getting language from the company and resolution of local issues.'' He refused to give details on the proposed contract. The spotlight now shifts back to the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> agreed Friday to extend their contract indefinitely and recess talks pending the outcome of Deere bargaining. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said the talks were not expected resume until after the <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> pact was ratified. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> was chosen as the target for a settlement or strike because union officials believed they had a better opportunity for contract gains there. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a chief <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> negotiator in the <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> talks, said the union likely would use the Deere contract as a pattern for talks with <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>. Caterpillar, the largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment with 58,800 employees worldwide, will face renewed union demands for 100 percent job security, a reduction in overtime, call-back of 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members on layoff and the first merit pay increase in a decade. The union reportedly is seeking a three-year pact and a three percent wage increase in each yeart. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> wants to hold down costs and is seeking more flexibility in job assignments and scheduling, and wants to restrict employee mobility and save money on retraining. If talks break down, either side can terminate the contract with five days' notice and <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> could face a strike by 17,500 blue-collar workers at plants in 12 cities in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. In a highly unusual move in <LOCATION> Deere </LOCATION> negotiations, representatives of both sides talked past a midnight Friday strike deadline with no formal extension of the current contract or call for a walkout. <PERSON> Mantyla </PERSON> said the union did not call for a strike, but scattered pickets were reported at Deere plants in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The tentative settlement averted a full-scale walkout like the bitter strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days with employees' acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions

<HEAD>Economic Growth Rate Slowed in September, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th and 6th graf to make clear rate of growth
slowed, not rate for new orders or production rate.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy continued to grow during September, but its expansion came at a slower pace than in the previous month, according to a survey of purchasing managers released Monday. The Purchasing Managers Index, compiled from a survey of purchasing executives at industrial firms, slipped to 54.8 percent last month from 56.2 percent in August, the index's third consecutive monthly decline. The survey, issued monthly, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. A reading of the index above 50 percent generally indicates the economy is expanding, while a reading below 50 is interpreted to mean the economy is contracting. September's index indicates that while the economy is growing, it is proceeding at a slower pace. The rate of growth in one of the components of the index, new orders, slowed for the third month in a row. Thirty-four percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said new orders were better in September than the preceding month, while 55 percent said orders were the same and 11 percent said they were down. That compared with 31 percent who said new orders were better in August, 54 percent who said orders were the same that month and 15 percent who said they were down. Production also expanded at a slower rate for a third consecutive month. Of the executives surveyed, 26 percent said production was better in September, 62 percent said it was the same and 12 percent said it was worse. In August 26 percent said it had improved, while 60 percent said output was the same and 14 percent said it had slowed. Vendor deliveries were again slow, but continued to pick up for the third straight month. Slower vendor deliveries are a sign that business is good, because they indicate manufacturers are receiving orders at a faster pace than they can be filled. In September, 19 percent of the respondents said vendor deliveries were slower than in the previous month, 73 percent said they were the same and 8 percent said they were faster. That compared with 20 percent who said they were slower in August, 73 percent who said they were the same and 7 percent who said they were faster. Inventories were down slightly, according to the survey. Twenty percent of the purchasing managers said inventories were up, 61 percent said they were steady and 19 percent said they were down. In August, 18 percent said they were up, 64 percent said they were the same and 18 percent said they were down. Prices continued to increase, the purchasing managers said, but at a much slower rate. Forty-seven percent of the purchasing managers said their companies were paying higher prices, 49 percent said prices were the same and 4 percent said they were lower. That compared with 55 percent who said prices were higher in August, 40 percent who said they were steady and 5 percent who said they were down. The survey found employment rising just slightly, reflecting the slower growth in production. Fourteen percent of the purchasing managers said employment was higher at their firms, 70 percent said it was the same and 16 percent said it was lower. In August, 16 percent said employment was up, 68 percent said it was the same and 16 percent said it was down. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managers </ORGANIZATION> is an education and research group. The association says it surveys purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies in its monthly survey.
