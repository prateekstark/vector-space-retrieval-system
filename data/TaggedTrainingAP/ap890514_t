 A jail inmate who made his second escape in two months by pulling a gun carved from soap was captured Sunday in a pecan grove. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, 23, was caught while walking in the grove south of <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> <PERSON> Talton </PERSON>. He escaped Saturday after he pulled what looked like a semiautomatic weapon on three guards and ordered another inmate to open a cellblock door. The gun had been carved from two bars of soap and painted black, <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said. `` At first glance, it looked like the real thing,'' <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said. `` Of course, when you looked close you could tell it was n't. He even used an eye from a shoe, like you run shoelaces through, to make the barrel look real.'' <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping, was one of seven inmates who escaped from the county jail two months ago. He was making a phone call Saturday when he asked jailer <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON> if he could get a drink of water from a cooler outside the security door, <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said. Cash let <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> through, <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> went to the water cooler, then pulled what appeared to be a gun, forced jailers to lie on the floor and made his escape, <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said. `` It's a situation that never should have happened,'' <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's a case of jailers being negligent and not following the rules of the jail.'' <PERSON> Talton </PERSON> said authorities would consider disciplinary action against Cash Monday.

<HEAD>Even Sweet Vidalias Can Drive Researchers To Tears</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> wears a mask and goggles at work. Otherwise, her job would drive her to tears. The lab technician at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>'s Coastal Plain Experiment Station peels and grinds samples of Vidalia onions and then conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers to identify the strength of an onion. The gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest, mildest in the world, but when there are 50 to 60 Vidalias to slice in a day, her lab fills with eye-burning fumes and a pungent odor. `` I have to wear a mask and goggles,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, my eyes burn and my sinuses throb.'' She and horticulturist <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON> are collecting information on sugar and pungency levels in Vidalias. `` We're trying to develop a rapid, objective method of measuring quality in onions,'' said <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON>. `` We'd like to have a technique ... simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measure the quality in at least every field of onions they have.'' This summer, food scientist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewfelt </PERSON> will convene a taste panel at the Experiment Station in <LOCATION> Griffin </LOCATION> to sample some of the same onions that have been tested. <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON>, who has been studying the compounds in onions since the mid-1970s, hopes to establish a relationship between the chemical composition of Vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel. Onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged by slicing. At that point, an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction that produces ammonia and other substances that cause tears. Chemical tests give a good indication of an onion's pungency, but they're too complicated and costly for routine use by growers, said <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON>. Taste buds are n't as reliable as laboratory tests because humans tend to forget how bad or good a sample was, he said. Members of the taste panel will sample six onions a day, then they'll come back a week or two later and evaluate the same onions. The horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that would scan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness. Since sugars absorb infrared light, there may be a correlation between taste and the amount of light that passes through onions, he said. <PERSON> Smittle </PERSON> believes growers eventually will be able to place stickers on each onion, with a picture of a thermometer showing the degree of mildness. His tests have shown that onion mildness varies from field to field and season to season. With a pungency rating, consumers could use the hotter onions in dishes that require more flavor. The rating also would help consumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 260 registered growers and packers have turned the Vidalia onion into a $ 30-million-a-year crop. Protected by state law, onions bearing the Vidalia label have to be a yellow Granex hybrid. The growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and parts of six other. Growers claim Vidalias are sweetest because of the variety and the low-sulfur soil around Vidalia, a town of 10,000 residents about 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rillieux </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matzeliger </PERSON> helped revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity simply because they were black. Historian <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> is setting matters straight with an ambitious new <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> exhibition that celebrates the genius of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unsung black inventors. The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40 inventors whose creations include a trouser-stretching device for eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923. `` The exhibition says a lot about their urge to create, and how important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of American technology,'' said Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, the show's curator. `` It was their assertion of black participation in the Yankee innovative spirit.'' The exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anacostia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afro-American </ORGANIZATION> history and culture is titled `` The Real McCoy: African American Invention and Innovation, 1619-1930.'' The show's name is taken from an invention by mechanical engineer <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> _ a grease cup designed for lubricating rail locomotives while they sped down the tracks. Admiring train engineers nicknamed it `` the real McCoy.'' On display are the two devices created by black inventors which probably have had the greatest lasting impact on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, said Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> who is the <LOCATION> Anacostia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>'s resident historian One of them, developed by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> inventor <PERSON> Rillieux </PERSON> in 1830, is a vacuum evaporation machine that made refined sugar widely affordable. It later was used to produce such foods as evaporated milk and cocoa powder. The other is <PERSON> Matzeliger </PERSON>'s shoe-lasting machine, patented in 1883 by the inventor from <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Surinam </LOCATION>. The machine radically changed the American shoe industry by eliminating the need for costly hand-stitching of soles to the soft leather uppers of shoes. The museum duly recognizes one of the few prominent black inventors, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, with a sampling of the products he derived from peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes in his laboratory at <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. But it also highlights such unknowns as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Latimer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the only black associate on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>'s laboratory team, who patented a carbon light bulb filament. Another is <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, who invented both the stop-go traffic signal and an industrial `` safety hood'' or gas mask which he used to rescue workers trapped by a tunnel explosion under <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> notes that African slaves introduced the banjo to American music, and that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> clergyman <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> learned of inoculation against smallpox from his North African slave Onesimus. The exhibition honors <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tailor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, the first black believed to have received a patent, for his dry cleaning process in 1821. On display are three wood planes designed in the 1770s by <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelor </PERSON>, a freed slave from <LOCATION> Wrentham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who is believed to be the earliest black toolmaker in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said her research for the exhibition took three years because of the scarcity of historical records. Material came from old newspapers and magazines published for the black community and from an exhaustive record of pre-1900 patents awarded to black inventors that was compiled by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an early black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent examiner, she said. Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON>' research yielded the tale of Oscar J.E. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> planter who tried to obtain a patent in 1857 for a labor-saving `` double cotton scraper'' invented by his slave, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> argued that `` the master is the owner of the fruits of the labor of the slave both intellectual and manual,'' but the federal government granted neither man a patent. Undaunted, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> began manufacturing <PERSON> Ned </PERSON>'s creation and issued advertising circulars containing this testimonial from a fellow plantation owner: `` I am glad to know that your implement is the invention of a <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> slave _ thus giving the lie to the Abolition cry that slavery dwarfs the mind of the Negro. When did a free Negro ever invent anything?'' As for the ingenious slave, Ms. <PERSON> James </PERSON> says, `` <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> disappeared from history, and nothing is known of what became of him.''

 A top House Democrat says an arrangement that earned him $ 6,882 in four months through buying junk bonds with other people's money `` was n't worth the trouble'' in light of the current focus on ethics. `` With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this transaction,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Sunday as he released his lawyer's report on the bond purchase As <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> is the third-ranking Democrat and chief vote-counter for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who has been charged by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee with violating rules in his personal financial dealings. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who could move up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> falls, said Sunday he would be amending his 1986 financial disclosure to include a previously unreported $ 50,000 loan that financed half of a $ 100,000 investment in junk bonds in 1986. His lawyer's report said the chief executive of the savings and loan that provided that financing had suggested the junk bond investment to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and then purchased the bonds on <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s behalf when the congressman needed more time to raise the money Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield bonds often used to finance corporate takeovers. According to his lawyer's report, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> first considered investing his 1986 campaign funds in the 12 1 @ 2 percent bonds, based on a suggestion by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> decided against that investment for his campaign treasury, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> himself could make an investment in the bonds, which were being issued for a takeover of Beatrice foods arranged by <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> When <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could not come up with the $ 100,000 by the required purchase date of May 5, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> bought the bonds himself and held them for a month while <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> completed his financing. Half the money came from <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION>'s thrift institution and the rest from two other banks. At that point, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> bought the bonds from <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> and paid him interest equivalent to what the bonds made during the period of the loan. When the congressman sold the bonds in October 1986, he was able to repay the loans and realize a $ 6,882 profit. In his report, attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> did not violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in his arrangement with <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, because the congressman paid interest and thus accepted no `` gift'' which might have been improper. The fact that the investment was issued at first to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s campaign committee, instead of the congressman, was a clerical error, <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> said Errors in the reported dates of the transactions might require <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to amend his 1986 tax returns, he said. `` We believe that the appearances presented by the transaction can be properly addressed by a full disclosure of all surrounding circumstances,'' he said. There is no indication whether the ethics committee is considering or plans to review the bond purchase. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> insists <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> has asked for no legislative favors and none were granted. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said in his statement he was `` accepting without reservations the conclusion of my legal counsel that the purchase of the bonds was totally above board.'' But, he said, `` public officials are today, however, living in a period of intense questioning. `` With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this transaction,'' he said. `` I do n't like it when my public decisions or private actions raise questions, as this investment did, and the $ 6,882 profit was n't worth the trouble.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> did not disclose the bond transaction with <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> or the loan from <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institution when <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last month first reported on his junk bond investment. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the congressman's staff had taken a month `` to understand fully and reconstruct this transaction. He said that effort did not include checking whether <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> had any interest in legislation, since that indicates a violation of House rules only if <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> had conferred a gift.

<HEAD>Speeches for a Fee: Congress Now Must Tell How Much it Gets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must soon disclose how much outside income they earned from speeches and other activities that have fueled debate over a congressional pay raise and created a preoccupation with ethics. On Friday senators and on May 22 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> will make public their financial disclosure forms, which all high-level people in the government must file. Although the forms reveal such matters as what stocks the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bought, sold and own and how much they got in reimbursements when they went on the road to make a speech, attention this year, as never before, is apt to focus on the fees paid members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for giving speeches. Common Cause, the public interest membership group which has campaigned for tougher ethical standards, says it has counted 245 newspaper editorials demanding an end to these honoraria _ calling the fees `` legalized bribery,'' `` legislative prostitution'' and `` lobbyists' payola.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' own rules, members are permitted to take $ 2,000 for giving speeches, writing articles or sometimes merely putting in an appearance. The fees are often paid by groups or companies with a vital interest in legislation before the speakers' committees Last May, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reported getting $ 9.8 million in honoraria fees in 1987, a 30 percent increase over 1986. Because House rules restrict outside earned income to 30 percent of salary and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules restrict senators from taking honoraria fees worth more than 40 percent of salary, many members get more than they can keep and give the overflow to charity. Last year, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> kept $ 7.5 million and gave away $ 2.3 million. The average senator kept $ 23,200 and the average House member kept $ 12,200. The defense industry alone paid more than $ 500,000 in speaking fees to members of congressional committees that deal with defense issues. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in endorsing a 51 percent pay boost in January that had been recommended by a commission appointed by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, also endorsed a simultaneous ban on honoraria. When a public outcry caused <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote down the pay raise, it also rejected the honoraria ban, but the issue did n't go away. A commission appointed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to recommend tighter ethics rules for government proposed a ban on all honoraria and more stringent limits on how much outside income can be earned by someone in government. More recently, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was charged with ethics violations, stemming in part from his earnings on a book. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charged he used bulk sales of the book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' to circumvent restrictions on outside income. Former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a member of the commission, said honoraria fees present the appearance of a conflict of interest. `` People wonder who's paying all these honoraria,'' he said. `` It undermines confidence in government.'' The financial disclosure requirement grew out of the Watergate-spawned demand for higher ethical standards in government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted an ethics code in 1977 and put it into law in 1978. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adopted most but not all of his commission's recommendations He called for banning honoraria for judges but not for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said he would deal with an honoraria ban when he again approaches the delicate issue of proposing a pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that will consider <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics recommendations, said he favors a ban on congressional honoraria fees, although he would allow members to continue earning some outside income for such activities as teaching a course in law school <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> refuses honoraria, as do a number of freshman congressmen. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is also required to disclose reimbursement for the `` actual and necessary travel expenses incurred'' when engaged in speechmaking. But Common Cause says many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` have used creative interpretations of these rules.'' The organization cited a report by Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., that he and his wife accepted round trip airfare to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and eight nights food and lodging paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> as necessary travel expenses or the report by Rep. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., that he got $ 3,948 in travel and lodging reimbursement for three days at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, paid by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION>

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration ca n't afford to be complacent about warming relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but neither must it fear the shift is taking place at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s expense, say analysts of Sino-Soviet ties. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which begins today, is unlikely to result in a renewal of the 1950s military alliance of communist giants, says <PERSON> Seweryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bialer </PERSON>, a Soviet specialist and professor of international relations at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's a -LRB- military -RRB- alliance. ... but it is a summit of major significance, because both countries need each other again,'' <PERSON> Bialer </PERSON> said at a recent luncheon hosted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the East-West Forum. <PERSON> Bialer </PERSON> predicted that economic cooperation between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will grow extensively now that the 30-year rift between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has been healed. `` Economic cooperation is in the interest of both countries,'' he said. And, he noted, Chinese officials have taken pains to let the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> know that renewed Sino-Soviet links will not come at the expense of the expanding U.S.-China relationship. An invitation to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships to visit <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, delayed until a day after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tours the port city, is designed as `` reassurance for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because the Chinese are very worried that this -LRB- summit -RRB- would be received very badly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the professor said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brick </PERSON>, an analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, argues that a military pact does n't appear to be in the offing because neither <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao-ping </PERSON> wants `` to risk access to vital Western financial and technological assistance.'' He points out that Americans can hardly criticize the Chinese for following the pattern of warming U.S.-Soviet relations. Also, he argues, the summit comes at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Chinese ties `` have deepened on so many fronts _ industrial, trade, military cooperation, shared technology and vast cultural and educational exchanges _ there is almost no possibility that a rapprochement with the Soviets would come at the price of cooler relations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' But the administration must be wary of any renewed military cooperation and let both nations know that such a development could cause the president to reassess his support for the normalization of relations, <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> said. If the Soviets and Chinese iron out their so-called `` three obstacles'' to improved ties _ tensions along their 4,670-mile border as well as Soviet involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> _ a more stable <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> could result, <PERSON> Brick </PERSON> said, a development that would benefit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, in an essay on the summit written for the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, points out that the summit occurs `` at a time when the Sino-American relationship is on a vastly more diversified footing than when Soviet initiatives toward <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> first began.'' <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> points to the growth in U.S.-China trade, which in 1988 surpassed $ 13 billion, or more than four times the level of Sino-Soviet trade; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has topped $ 3 billion, more than any other single country; and more than 30,000 Chinese students are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as technological and military exchanges are growing. `` American interests would not be well served by an attempt to curry favor with either state in the aftermath of the summit; the basis for good relations with both <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> can and does exist independent of their relations with each other,'' says the think tank's specialist on Chinese-Soviet ties. Most analysts agree the summit may mark the symbolic end of the strategic triangular relationship that gave birth to the notion of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> playing the so-called `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card,'' or the idea that the antagonistic relationship between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> offered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leverage in dealing with either nation. `` There is no more triangle _ it is a quadrangle,'' said <PERSON> Bialer </PERSON>, who points to the entrance of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the major economic power in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The shift does present a new and more complex challenge, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> says, `` especially since there no longer seem any illusions about the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to manipulate Sino-Soviet differences to the advantage of American interests.''

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Sales Keep the Trains Rolling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One million metric tons of wheat would fill 11,100 covered hopper cars used by railroads to move grain. If towed by a single locomotive, the train would be about 116 miles long, according to figures supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already bought enough wheat and corn this fiscal year to fill about 20 of the million-ton trains. If those were lined up one behind the other, they would stretch 2,320 miles _ roughly the distance from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> to Twin Falls, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Specifically, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has bought a record 19.3 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn for delivery through Sept. 30, and has been cleared to purchase a maximum of 24 million tons by then. And the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is only part of the huge annual export flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm commodities that move by railroad, truck and river barge to seaports and then to overseas points. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the biggest single foreign customer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ this year, at least _ is the largest buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s grain needs, coupled with historic secrecy in the early dealings with Soviet buyers, are paramount in the way <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and farmers look at the export situation. Crop failure in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, or even the hint of significant losses, can send tremors through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and world commodity markets. It's something that's watched closely by farmers, private traders and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts. By law, private exporters must report all big sales _ 100,000 tons or more _ to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> within 24 hours. All sales, regardless of size, are reported weekly. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has updated her records showing the high marks for one-day grain sales. No specific country's are listed, however. The public announcements of large grain sales go back to early 1977, although weekly disclosures go back several more years. When very large grain sales are announced, there are sometimes inquiries about their relative size and whether a record has been reached. Nollmeyer's list helps answer those questions. The biggest day's activity on <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON>'s list was on July 6, 1979, when exporters reported sales totaling nearly 2.48 million tons of grain, including 1.86 million tons of corn and 616,200 tons of wheat. But, because of a provision in the law, the exporters reported the grain's foreign destination as `` unknown.'' Often, however, the grain in the initial `` unknown'' category is changed in later reports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or some other buyer. Unofficially, since <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON>'s one-day records go back only to April 14, 1977, there were a few sales larger than the one she cites. This requires a bit of history. The export reporting system was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s following huge secret dealings between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and private grain companies. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1972, for example, secretly bought about a fourth of that year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat crop, plus corn, barley and soybeans. In all, more than 16 million tons of those commodities were contracted in a few weeks of dealing in the summer of 1972. About three-fourths of the grain was wheat. `` The huge, anticipated Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn that year produced a sizable runup in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food prices and depleted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reserve stocks,'' the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says in a background report. And there were charges that some <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> insiders had played along with the Soviets, that fat export subsidies were involved and that there was even a commodity spy at work. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stepped into the fray in 1973, ordering an export sales reporting system to help bring order and accountability to the business. But there was still turmoil, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, periodically faced with huge food deficits, continued to be an erratic customer of the American farmer. In 1975, after another round of large sales, further shipments were embargoed by President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in July and finally lifted the following October after a long-term agreement was worked out with the Soviets to buy annual amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn. The pact took effect on Oct. 1, 1976, and has been renewed or extended since then. Even so, sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sometimes were huge. On April 28, 1976, for example, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced sales of corn totaling 1.4 million tons. Later the same day, officials announced a further sale of 1.7 million tons of corn plus 300,000 tons of wheat. In all, the one-day flurry involved the sale of 3.4 million tons of grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Nowadays, with exporters and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> accustomed to the long-term agreement's terms and the reporting requirements, a sale of a million tons or so in one day is considered unusual. In fact, according to <PERSON> Nollmeyer </PERSON>'s list, one-day total grain sales to all foreign buyers, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have exceeded 2 million tons only three times since 1977.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> say business is surprisingly good and they're prepared to weather the sharp downturn that looms ahead. Members of the Business Council, made up of chief executives from 65 major corporations, gathered at the posh Homestead resort this past weekend for their semiannual country retreat. The Business Council's economists are projecting that economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, will fall from last year's strong 3.9 percent pace to 1.4 percent by the end of the year and rebound late in 1990. But many executives were generally more bullish than their own analysts. `` We really see that as good news, not bad news,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` When you get a slowing of growth, it should keep inflation down.'' Signs of an economic slowdown have proliferated in recent months, in weak retail sales, flat industrial production, plunging home sales and construction and slower overall spending by consumers. Still, even among leaders of industries most affected by the slowdown, there were few furrowed brows over the weekend or admissions that trouble lies ahead. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, said general merchandisers are seeing `` somewhat better sales than anticipated.'' <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> did acknowledge the onset of a slowdown in spending on big-ticket `` durable goods'' such as major appliances, but he said companies are doing a good job of keeping their inventories under control. A similarly bright outlook for the auto industry, which has experienced sluggish sales so far this year, came from <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and of the Business Council. `` Any time that our industry is looking at car and truck sales up in the 15 million area, why it's got to be a good year for us,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He conceded that sales are being propped up by big rebates and cut-rate financing, but said surveys showing that consumer confidence remains high bode well for future sales. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said business leaders are making few plans to retrench because the slowing economy still offers the prospect of reasonable growth. `` We do n't see, at least in front of us today, any precipitous drop,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. `` Capital spending will remain about where it is and productivity will continue to improve.'' Said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, `` My view is that there's a little stronger undercurrent to the economy than this forecast, and I think there will be higher inflationary pressures.'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said he believes gains in American productivity have been underestimated and favorable exchange rates are making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive overseas. S.D. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>, chairman of the giant engineering and construction company that bears his name, had a similarly positive outlook for the economy overall, although he said the construction business remains weak. `` We've been down for several years and the economy got its strength without us,'' he said. Several chief executives said a possible jinx to the bright outlook lies in the risk of interest rates rising further. `` That changes currency rates and starts a whole set of things going that are difficult to plan for,'' <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to rein in inflation by restraining economic growth. A growing number of analysts are expressing concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could push interest rates so high and slow growth so much that it unintentionally pushes the country into a recession. `` The biggest thing that we would fear would be ... hype on the economy that would lead to <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> quick-trigger action,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said.

 Protesters demanding the dismantling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> garrisons in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> tried to go over a wall and into a U.S.-Spanish naval base but were turned back by police using clubs, rubber bullets and tear gas, police said. No arrests or injuries were reported in Sunday's confrontation. The roughly 400 protesters, many with their faces covered, were among about 5,000 people who had marched on the joint-use base, police said. March organizers estimated the crowd at 15,000. The marchers, who also shouted anti-NATO slogans, walked nearly 10 miles to the base from the town of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> base is about 50 miles north of the Strait of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The march was organized by regional pacifist groups. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed a new eight-year pact on Dec. 1 that mandates removal of 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter bombers from Spanish soil by 1992. But it permits continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of three military bases, including <LOCATION> Rota </LOCATION>. The new agreement reduces the maximum number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops allowed to be stationed in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> by 36 percent, from 12,545 to 8,078.

 An Army Chinook helicopter Saturday found the body of a climber on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> after a two-day search that began with the discovery of his climbing partner's frozen corpse. The helicopter's crew spotted the body of 26-year-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, around noon at the 9,400-foot mark of <ORGANIZATION> Carbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION>, on the mountain's north side, said <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A crew of six to eight climbers were prevented from getting the body because thunderstorms made it unsafe for a helicopter to fly into the area, a Mt. Rainier dispatcher said. Rescue crews will try again Sunday, he said. `` He apparently slipped off <PERSON> Liberty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> as he tried to come back down,'' <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. `` He apparently died of the fall.'' <PERSON> Derkdowski </PERSON>'s climbing partner, 33-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was found dead below Liberty Cap on the 14,410-foot mountain Thursday by two others in the climbing party. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duin </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, 27, both of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, came upon <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>'s body Thursday at the 13,700-foot level and descended to alert authorities, who dispatched 30 searchers and three helicopters to look for <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> apparently had left <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> to find the two other climbers, <PERSON> Hentges </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>'s body was taken to the county medical examiner. <PERSON> Derdowski </PERSON> is survived by a wife and a 9-month old son. <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> was single.

 Thousands of students huddled in wind-swept Tiananmen Square on Sunday after the first night of a hunger strike for democracy, ignoring government appeals they end their protest. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on Saturday urged the students not to disrupt the visit of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who arrives Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. The official <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily announced the central square will be cleared of all pedestrians and traffic on Monday. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> also told a workers' group Saturday in the Great Hall of the People, adjoining the square, that the government is seriously considering ways to promote democracy and end official corruption. Both are student demands. About 3,500 students from more than a dozen universities, all wearing white headbands to signify participation in the fast, converged on the square Saturday afternoon and evening. However, by Sunday morning there were only about 1,800 who appeared to be participating. They were encircled by about 1,000 other non-fasting students. Police made no attempt to interfere with the protest. But the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said the square will be closed to pedestrians from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Monday -LRB- 7:30 p.m. EDT Sunday to 7:30 a.m. EDT Monday -RRB- and on Tuesday from 8 a.m. to noon. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told the workers Saturday that democratic changes and corruption will be discussed next month when the Standing Committee of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature meets. `` Every patriotic Chinese citizen should safeguard the dignity of the motherland and its international image,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as saying. `` Nobody should do anything to impede or jeopardize the summit.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s remarks followed a meeting of the ruling Politburo last week that endorsed his moderate line toward student demands, according to Sunday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper, quoting three unidentified Chinese familiar with the proceedings, said the result of the meeting held Wednesday and Thursday was to bolster <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s faction and its calls for economic and political reform. Leading activist <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said fasting students may still be in the square when the Soviet leader arrives Monday for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. `` As for whether we will disrupt Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that depends on the government,'' he said. `` We will persist to the end,'' said fasting graduate students from <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a last resort.'' Early Sunday, hundreds of students and workers began flocking to the square with banners and posters to express support for the fast. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> arrived at the square shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday but was shouted down when he tried to address the crowd. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> was accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> and they left 15 minutes later. About 30 students met earlier with <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingfu </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He was the highest-ranking party official to confer with the demonstrators. Two student leaders reported that he told them that some party members want to use the turmoil as a reason to stop reforms. The hunger strikers, wearing white headbands and sashes, sat inside a protective cordon of several thousand non-fasting students in the vast square that is the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. As temperatures dropped after sunset Saturday to below 50 degrees, many pulled on jackets or covered themselves with blankets, while others wrapped themselves in their red and white banners. Shortly before midnight, four trucks and two buses of police pulled up to the square and security forces stood watching. They did not intervene. The fast began Saturday evening after the students marched several hours from their campuses to the square. It is the latest in a month-old student campaign for a free press, human rights, an end to official corruption and other reforms. After repeated student marches, sit-ins and a class boycott, the government made a major concession Friday by offering to meet Monday with an independent student group. However, students said they were still discussing with officials the terms of a possible dialogue. They were dissatisfied with government conditions that include a limit on the number of student delegates and insistence that students from state-sponsored organizations also attend. Students also said they wanted the talks to be broadcast live. If talks are held, the students want the government to guarantee not to punish students who have protested; to observe constitutional guarantees of free speech; and to reinstate a liberal newspaper editor fired for resisting censorship. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced a one-day delay in the arrival of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> so the event does not coincide with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s planned visit to the port city. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday the ships will make the port call May 19, the day after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit The announcement appeared to defuse a major source of diplomatic friction between the Soviets and the Chinese.

 <LOCATION> SAN </LOCATION> <LOCATION> BERNDARDINO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> CALIF </LOCATION> _ The braking systems were faulty on two locomotives of a freight train that thundered down the steep <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, smashed into 11 homes and killed four people, investigators said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> acting Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> told reporters Saturday night that the so-called dynamic brakes failed to work. But it was too early to tell if that caused the wreck, he said. Locomotives have air brakes which apply pressure to the wheels; dynamic brakes reverse the direction of the wheels, he explained. `` It appears a great majority of the cars were braking at the time of the accident,'' he said. The search of the wreckage ended Saturday afternoon, and heavy equipment began removing the twisted train cars that flew off curved tracks into the homes Friday. The body of a crewman was found at 2:30 a.m., hours after a man was pulled alive from his crumbled home. No one else was reported missing. Twenty-nine families were evacuated from their homes because the wrecked cars lay over an underground gas line. By Saturday night, 19 families still had to remain out of their houses, including those houses hit in the derailment, said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The 69-car <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight hauling a sandy mineral raced down 4,109-foot Cajon Pass between the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, derailed on a curve and hit 11 homes about 7:40 a.m. Friday. The crew radioed to a dispatcher that it was out of control at 90 mph. `` The train was all over the place,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorame </PERSON>. `` It looked like a toy in a sandbox. ... Some of the people thought it was an earthquake.'' The dead were identified as stepbrothers <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 7; conductor <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crown </PERSON>, 36, a 17-year <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> employee; and brakeman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, 44, an 18-year employee, whose body was not found until Saturday morning. Three trainmen and six other people were injured. One of the injured, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 24, survived for hours under the wreckage. He was found Friday evening later in a pocket of air under rail cars and the sandy cargo that crushed his home.

The train was going from <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> in the high desert to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> with a load of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, components of potash, a mineral used to make fertilizer and soap, railroad spokesmen said. The tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day, forcing the detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains.

 A strong earthquake in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> early Sunday shook the tiny <LOCATION> Kermadec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, 760 miles north of here, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said. Initial reports said the quake measured 6.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said a spokesman for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, the capital. No information was immediately available on injuries or damage on the remote islands, which measure only about 13 square miles and belong to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas, while one measuring 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

 An estimated 20,000 people were evacuated from their homes in a suburb on Sunday after a package with wires attached was found atop a liquid petroleum gas tank at a service station, police said. The southern suburb of <LOCATION> Moorabin </LOCATION> was sealed off for more than three hours before residents were allowed to return to their homes. Locals were told to congregate at nearby schools and sports fields while police and army bomb disposal experts checked the package. A police spokesman, who declined to identify himself, said the suspected bomb was apparently the work of a hoaxer. Police were investigating the incident, the spokesman said.

 Charging riot police lashing out with truncheons and shields Sunday dispersed thousands of protesters who marched for a second day to protest the death of a radical student. About 5,000 riot police tore into a crowd of about the same number in front of the provincial government headquarters. Screaming protesters were trampled underfoot as troopers broke up the crowd after some people tried to force their way past police. Radical students pelted police with rocks and bricks as fighting surged up and down <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>'s main street. Some police and protesters were hurt in the fighting. Police officials said they had no figures on injuries. Protesters were marching to denounce authorities over the death of radical student <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-kyu </PERSON>. Dissidents claim police tortured and killed him. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, a provincial capital 170 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police, who were hunting <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> for anti-government acitivies, have denied any involvement in the death. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, officials said pathology tests were conducted Sunday to determine if <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body contained plankton, which they said would suggest that he died by drowning. Initial results would be released Monday, they said. Radical student leaders told a news conference Sunday they would appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an independent investigation of the death if an official Korean probe concludes police were not responsible. Dissident leaders called during the protest Sunday for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and demanded the expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The dissidents claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are trying to impose authoritarian rule on the country.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet on Sunday approved Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s long-awaited plan for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The vote was 20-6. The four-page, 20-point <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan passed easily, largely because it sidestepped controversial points such as foreign supervision of elections, participation of 140,000 Arabs in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and a timetable for the balloting. Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> led right-wing opposition to the proposal. He was joined in voting against the plan by two other ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> members, two from the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and one from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was quoted by an aide as telling the Cabinet it was `` a sure recipe for more violence and terror'' and one that could raise `` a danger of war.'' He was quoted by an aide as proposing his own seven-point plan, which calls for extending Israeli law to Jewish settlements in the occupied lands, an act equivalent to annexation. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>, accused the Cabinet of rushing into a decision because of the presence of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delegation led by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, chief of policy planning. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> met with four moderate Palestinians but 11 others boycotted the meeting in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The key topic was the elections proposal, which Palestinians made clear would have to be endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Five Palestinians who did not attend sent a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials criticizing the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan as `` grossly deficient.'' The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials pushed for a timetable on elections. It said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> believed elections could be held within one year while Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> estimated six months were needed. In addition to the timetable, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to allow 140,000 east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> to vote and to permit international supervision of balloting. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan does not refer to either issue. It reportedly calls for electing 10 Palestinians from the occupied territories to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on an interim period of autonomy, with talks to begin after three years on the final status of the territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hopes the plan will help end the 17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, in which at least 472 Arabs and 21 Israelis have been killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> later annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: Israel and South Africa Involved in Technology Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper said Sunday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> secret service was involved in South African efforts to obtain British missile technology. The Sunday Telegraph, a conservative weekly, attributed its report to unidentified `` security sources in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' It said the sources claimed Mossad and the South African arms manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION> were linked to an operation that led to the arrests of five men in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month in an arms deal. The report said, `` The ultimate goal of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> operation is thought to have been for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to undertake joint development of a series of high-speed missiles for use by both ground and air forces.'' It claimed three of the men arested in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> were <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Protestants who allegedly were negotiating with a South African diplomat and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms dealer to exchange British missile parts made in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for South African arms. According to the newspaper, the plan involved smuggling parts of the shoulder-launched Blowpipe missile to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to enable <ORGANIZATION> Armscor </ORGANIZATION> to develop its own missiles. It said <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> wanted to acquire the technology for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Starstreak missile. Both the Blowpipe and Starstreak missiles are made at the <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> factory in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Sunday Telegraph said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s MI6 intelligence service was trying to determine how <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> activists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> received arms believed to have been purchased with South African money and shipped through militia groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It is here that sources believe <PERSON> Mossad </PERSON> actively assisted with the South African operation,'' the newspaper said. Protestant and Roman Catholic militants have been battling in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for nearly 20 years. The Catholics want to unite the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province, where Protestants outnumber Caholics 3-2, with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 Syrian and allied Druse gunners showered the besieged Christian heartland with sporadic artillery fire on Sunday, and gun battles broke out in the hills above <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian troops were locked in sniper fire and rocket-propelled grenade duels with Syrian and Druse forces at the mountaintop town of Souk el-Gharb southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The strategic town sits atop a road network leading from the Druse territory in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains to the Christian enclave north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported at the Souk el-Gharb front. Police said at least 40 shells were fired from Syrian-controlled west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> onto a coastal stretch running trough the port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>, 19 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported in the barrage, apparently aimed at preventing ships from entering the harbor. At least 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded since the current round of fighting in the 14-year-old war broke out March 8. The confrontation began when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunboats and helicopter gunships blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined the bombardment and sealed off the enclave's land and sea outlets. The fighting Sunday came despite a truce called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the fourth cease-fire called by the group in two months. Arab League mediators proclaimed the latest cease-fire Thursday, calling it an `` inland truce'' to halt the shelling duels that wreaked havoc on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors and many summer resort towns in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains. <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, a secretary-general of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said he would begin new negotiations with the warring factions this week. Ibrahimi was in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Sunday where he met with Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s allies said they would keep shelling the Christian coast, despite the truce, to prevent arms supplies to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops. They contend that at least three ships carrying arms from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were waiting in international waters off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to cruise in and resupply the Christian forces. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesmen have denied the claim. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe. The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops stationed in 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has charged the Syrians have become an occupation force because they sided with the Moslems. He has vowed to drive them out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Sunday that the reforms of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have not gone far enough to cure an ailing economy or bring democracy.

He said the stagnation was occurring because the government dismantled old bureaucratic structures but has not created new ones. The 67-year-old physicist criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for emergency measures he had taken to limit demonstrations in the wake of nationalist uprisings. `` We are in a blind alley, and there have been various political decisions taken lately which I will not hesitate to define as anti-democratic,'' he said. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was detained for nearly seven years in the northern city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> after he criticized the Soviets' 1979 military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

 Riot troops Sunday broke up a march by thousands of people protesting the death of a radical student they claim was tortured and killed by police. Police used clubs and shields on the crowd of about 5,000 who gathered outside the provincial government headquarters in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 170 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Some protesters were trampled as people tried to force their way past police. Injuries were seen during the violent confrontation but police said they had no figures. Radical students pelted police with rocks and bricks as fighting surged up and down <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>'s main street. Hundreds of onlookers jeered and yelled insults as police tried to clear the street by marching in lines with interlocked shields. `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' protesters chanted. `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' A larger but less-violent protest was held Saturday, and a march by about 1,000 people earlier on Sunday was peaceful. The marches were called by radical students to protest the death of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-kyu </PERSON>, whose body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Authorities fear <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death will keep heightening tensions in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, which marks the anniversary this week of the May 18, 1980, uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Many students blame President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, a former military general, for the bloody suppression of the uprising. All police in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and nearby areas were put on special alert. Dissidents claim <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who was being sought by police for anti-government activities, was tortured to death by authorities. Police said an autopsy last week showed no signs of torture and that pathology tests Sunday confirmed the existence of plankton in his body, indicating death by drowning. To ensure the credibility of the tests, authorities allowed two independent medical experts and opposition lawmakers to take part in or witness the process. Radical student leaders told reporters they would appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, to conduct an independent investigation if the official Korean probe concluded police were blameless. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung-jang </PERSON>, one of the student leaders, claimed government pathologists were helping cover up police involvement. `` We can not trust them,'' he told the news conference. During the march, dissidents called for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and demanded the expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The dissidents claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are trying to impose authoritarian rule on the country. Radical students and dissidents, estimated by government officials at 10,000, are a well-organized minority in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 42 million population But they lack public support because of their violent tactics and extreme views.

 Scottish nationalists blew up a stone-crushing plant because the quarry where it was located was going to be used as a nuclear waste dump, an anonymous telephone caller claimed on Sunday.

 The meeting between <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> will alter a 30-year-old constant in the geopolitical equation _ the Sino-Soviet split. The result will be a more complex world with hazier alliances. For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the dynamic 57-year-old leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the visit is one step of many on his way into history. `` He will bring his people peace on their southern flank,'' said one <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat. `` He will also show the world that having dealt with the West, he can now deal with the East.'' For the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the summit could constitute the last waltz of a tumultuous 60-year career as a soldier of the revolution and guiding force of the world's most populous country. `` A successful summit will be the icing on the cake of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s career as a revolutionary,'' said a Western expert `` It will cement <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s standing as an international force.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has welcomed the summit as a development destined to reduce international tensions. But it also has been at pains to emphasize to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> the importance <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attaches to its ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reacted with glee when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> managed a hurried visit in February, months ahead of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They also expressed satisfaction that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 7th Fleet will arrive in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on the heels of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its part emphasizes that the summit does not mean a new socialist bloc. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guihua </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would not enter `` into alignment or develop strategic ties with any big power or power groups.'' The summit will not be without drama _ both international and domestic. Chinese students, who have been demonstrating for a month for democracy and freedom, are planning a special `` welcoming session'' for the Soviet leader, well-regarded in this tightly-controlled country for redefining the boundaries of dissent in his country. Coinciding with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival, Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> begin their withdrawal as part of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s promise to cut tensions on the Soviet-Chinese border. Knowing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s penchant for unexpected gifts, the meeting will not likely lack surprises. Two possibilities, according to <PERSON> Xing </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugang </PERSON>, a Soviet expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, would be to give ground on the border or provide a timetable for pledged withdrawal of 200,000 troops stationed near <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hanging over the summit is a 10-year war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that both nations say they want to end. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a Soviet client state, invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and ousted the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in December 1978. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will attempt to keep <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the foreground while the Soviets will try to avoid the issue, diplomats said. The critical point, according to diplomats, is whether <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will accept <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s desire to be the main peace broker, thereby recognizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s traditional claim to influence in the region. `` <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the touchstone of the summit for the Chinese,'' said an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They will stop any communique until the last minute so they can get what they want.'' `` For the Russians,'' he said, `` the main goal is the symbolism of these meetings. They are in a better position because they do n't want anything specific. Solutions to other problems, such as a border dispute and their world views, depend on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, he said. When communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was founded in 1949, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the first country to recognize it, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> relied on Soviet assistance to develop. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> signed a strategic alliance, and thousands of Soviet advisers flooded the country, setting up industrial projects. But relations soured in the late 1950s and early 1960s because of an ideological split centering around Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s policy that socialist countries could peacefully coexist with countries in the West. A personality clash between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> added to the problem. Officials are optimistic this summit will be an improvement on the last one, between <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in October 1959, when the Soviet leader stormed to the airport with a dour look on his face. Relations hit a low point in 1969 when the two clashed repeatedly on the border. But following political changes in both countries, ties began to improve in the late 1970s. Trade began again and is now worth about $ 3.25 billion a year.

<TEXT>
 Voters Sunday chose from among writers, a weightlifter, a popular investigator, and many others across the political spectrum in a second-round election to fill the remaining 198 seats in a new parliament. More than 1,200 candidates, an average of six per district, were vying for seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies left open after March 26 elections. The seats being contested were those in which no candidate received a majority of the vote. In March, voters rejected dozens of top government and party leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Most officials embarrassed on March 26 did not run again. On Sunday, one district in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> fielded 34 candidates. Another in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> had 33. In many districts, another run-off election was likely before a winner was decided. Results were expected to trickle in Monday or Tuesday. Candidates included such figures as <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, the editor of <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, in the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Kharkov </LOCATION>; prosecutor <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, an anti-corruption crusader in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>; Olympic weightlifting champion <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON>, and playwright <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>; commentator <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovin </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, editor of the ultra-conservative monthly <PERSON> Molodaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gvardiya </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Zagorsk </LOCATION>. The new 2,250-member parliament was created by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a reform that he said will strengthen the legislature. It will choose the president and the new ruling Supreme Soviet, but less than two weeks from the May 25 first meeting, many of its functions and procedures have yet to be decided. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kunsovsky </LOCATION> district, a retired army colonel said he and many other veterans voted for Afghan war hero <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudskoy </PERSON>. `` We fought during the last war and understand the man well,'' said the colonel, who refused to identify himself. In <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, prosecutor <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, who led a broad anti-corruption probe, was a favorite among 33 candidates seeking a seat. In <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, another 33 candidates were seeking the seat that local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Masyk </PERSON> lost March 26. Among them was theater director <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Taniuk </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> group that seeks greater independence for the Baltic republics. In the Baltic republics there were eight races. One candidate in the Latvian capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> was prosecutor <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Djenitis </PERSON>, a party hardliner who topped the list of most unpopular Latvians in a poll conducted last year by a youth newspaper. Another was political reformer <PERSON> Mavrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulfson </PERSON>. The first vote on March 26 hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s prestige. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it showed Soviets were enthusiastic about reforms but frustrated that local leaders were lagging behind. Of the 198 seats up in Sunday's election, 195 were in districts were voters rejected the choices given them in March. In three districts in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, repeat elections were held because fewer than half of the voters participated the first time.

<TEXT>
 When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looks for votes on Capitol Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last November. House members and political analysts differ among themselves on the impact of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lack of coattails. But there is no argument that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was carrying 40 of the 50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided government by choosing a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was a big message in this election and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked it up,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for `` trying to establish a level of trust that has n't existed for 12 years.'' `` You run independent of everyone,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. But she insisted that a president's persuasive ability is not tied to the results of the last election. `` If the president calls you and asks you to vote for something, any living member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who says it is easy to say no, is absolutely saying that for a press statement,'' she said. `` After the election it is n't Democrat or Republican, it's the president.'' An analysis of the 1988 election results, published in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran ahead of the successful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidate in only 56 of the 435 House districts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> out polled only 26 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Half of the Democrats were from the South, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strongest region in the presidential vote. While those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the president's electoral weakness, they might more accurately reflect the strength of House members Of the 435 House winners in 1988, only 63 received under 60 percent of the vote. By contrast, when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was elected in 1980, he ran ahead of 59 Republican winners. In addition his coattails were credited with giving Republicans control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in a quarter century and with a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pickup of 33 House seats. Did that make a difference? `` It was very easy to deal with reluctant Republicans or persuadable Democrats'' during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first two years in office, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a Republican consultant who was involved in trying to generate support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s agenda. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s clout on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> diminished sharply after the 1982 midterm election when the Democrats won back 26 House seats. `` It was back to business as usual,'' said <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. `` I've always been the Republican in whose district our presidential candidates did least well,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> whose district runs along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was re-elected with 61 percent of the vote, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was receiving only 33 percent against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I was the only Republican elected in a district <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't carry in'84,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> describes himself as a progressive Republican and his support for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes declined from a high of 55 percent of the time in 1981 to 38 percent in 1986, according to Congressional Quarterly. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said, `` Plainly in 1981 one of the things <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had going for him in winning votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was the ability to persuade marginal Democrats in certain parts of the country that if they did n't come along they'd be very vulnerable in 1982. `` Obviously, that kind of capacity is lacking -LRB- for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- at this point.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of governmental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We're getting to the point where there will be zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns. `` It reinforces the view on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that their electoral fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no electoral ties that bind. Whatever incentives they have for working with the president, elections are not one of them.'' `` Not many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are going to quake in their boots when presidents try to force them to do things,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Presidents win by big margins; presidents win by small margins; members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> go marching on,'' he said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, who served on the White House staffs of presidents <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, said members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> get a sense of a president's clout in their districts from polls and letters and from their trips back home. `` They do n't need to look at last November's election returns to know how well <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stands in their district and, of course, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably stands in their district better than he did on November 8.'' `` A president is not a hapless giant,'' said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. `` There are appointments members want, there are grants that they want, there are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> echoed that view. `` What the president has to offer members is not really electability,'' she said. `` It's coming in for fund-raisers, it is the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it is members feeling they are working with the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to accomplish something.''

<HEAD>Soviet Exit Permits At Record Heights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is soaring to new heights, sending thousands of Germans, Armenians, Pentecostals as well as Jews, on their way to new lives in other countries. In the first four months of this year, 57,000 exit permits were granted while the Soviets also moved closer to adopting laws that will ease most of the restrictions of the past. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights office, was shown drafts of some of the legislation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where he worked on the human rights issue before and during the two-day visit last week of Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Beginning in September, Soviet lawyers and judges will be coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for extended visits to study American legal procedures _ another sign of the changes brought about by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached an all-time high in 1979, as superpower relations were improved during the period known as detente. That year, 51,320 left the country with visas for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but most of them wound up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest figure for any single month since October 1979, the peak year. The issuance of 57,000 permits this January through April points to a new record, though actual departure generally lags for a few months behind receipt of a permit. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said the figures break down this way: 27,000 ethnic Germans were granted permits to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; 17,500 Jews for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>; 3,500 Pentecostals for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, 5,000 Armenians for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; and 4,000 others for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere. If past practice is a guide, nearly 90 percent of the Jews with permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will revise their destinations once they have left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and most of them will come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pentecostals, who also contend authorities severely restrict their religious practices, are invariably given permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and also wind up elsewhere. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> was encouraged by the projected changes in Soviet law as well as by the rise in emigration. While in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> he was shown a draft of a decree that would repeal a requirement that a would-be emigrant have an invitation from a close relative. The restriction had been applied to German ethnics seeking permission to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and to Jews and Pentecostals. <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> also was shown a draft of another legal directive abolishing the right of parents to block the departure of would-be emigrants. The Soviets, he said, also are lowering another barrier: involvement in the past in sensitive work. All prospective emigrants who were engaged in security-related occupations will be eligible for permits five years after leaving the job. There will be special exceptions, but only high-level officials rather than bureaucrats in the security agencies will have the power to invoke them. The easing of the restriction will not be retroactive. But, <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said, Soviet authorities said they would consider old applications `` in light of the new rules.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said a new law assuring freedom of religion would leave the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as `` the only problem.'' He said Soviet authorities consider the church a source of Ukrainian nationalism. Generally, though, most of the signs are positive. One example: All the Jewish `` refuseniks'' invited to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy for a Passover Seder in 1987 attended also by then-Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> _ some 40 of whom previously had been denied visas _ have since been permitted to leave the country.

 Young bicyclists who break the law this summer will be hauled off to Bicycle Court for a spin on the wheels of justice. Those convicted wo n't be put on a chain gang, but they could be sentenced to a week with crayons and a coloring book full of safety hints. The kids' court was designed to simulate the legal system and teach youths a lesson in safety. The program was discontinued last year, when youths served as judge and jury, but has been revamped by the police department in time for this summer, safety officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittel </PERSON> said. This time, a police officer will mete out justice, <PERSON> Kittel </PERSON> said. `` Some kids got let go because they were friends with the kids serving as court officers,'' he said. `` Others got pretty stiff penalties because they were not friends with the kids serving on the court.'' Children age 7 to 9 who are convicted in Bicycle Court this year must color a safety coloring book. Youths 10 to 13 must write essays on bicycle safety. Each has one week to complete the `` sentence.'' Bicycle Court will be held at the police station once a week beginning later this month. <PERSON> Kittel </PERSON> said he expects a full court docket once school gets out.

 This city claimed champion status in the battle of the breakfasts when 33,869 locals turned out to dine on thousands of pounds of pancakes washed down with 600 gallons of coffee. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> claimed the title of world's biggest breakfast Saturday morning when volunteers who had spent 12 hours mixing pancake batter served up a four-hour meal that would not have won approval from Weight Watchers.

 Two Soviet trade officials arrived in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> on Sunday for an international economic meeting, the first known visit by Soviet officials to this staunchly anti-communist island. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhremenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> are to attend as observers the three-day annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes economic cooperation in the Pacific rim. During a stopover in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the two were quoted by Taiwanese reporters as saying the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intended to become a member of the council. Their arrival came as Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in three decades. About 300 bankers and business leaders from 14 countries and territories are to attend the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> conference, which begins Tuesday. <PERSON> Akhremenko </PERSON> is executive secretary of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has issued special travel permits instead of entry visas to the Soviet representatives. Foreign Ministry officials said the ministry would not stamp official seals on their passports to avoid giving the impression that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> recognizes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has no diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and has long considered it a hostile nation. The Nationalists, who fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist forces on the mainland, have claimed the Soviets aided the Chinese Communists' victory. However, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s indirect trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has grown significantly in the past year as the government adopted a more liberal trade policy to promote trade exchanges with countries in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Last year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s indirect exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled $ 3.5 million, up about fivefold from 1987, while imports from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> increased threefold in the same period, totaling $ 3.1 million. In March, two <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women were allowed to participate in an international beauty pageant in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. They were the first Soviet citizens to be issued entry visas to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

 Baltic activists Sunday called for economic independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by next year and demanded a trial of Soviet officials blamed for killing or deporting thousands of countrymen. The first gathering of grass-roots People's Fronts groups from the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> stopped short of demanding independence for their once-sovereign homelands. But the 400 activists meeting in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in the Estonian capital urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> not to `` obstruct the restoration of state sovereignty'' in their homelands. Some said the wording was a legal prelude to independence. In the final session of the two-day meeting, the Baltic assembly said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms failed to halt economic decline, and the assembly called for economic independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by early next year. The resolution said the republics have the right to choose any economic system that would meet material needs, protect the environment, and break the stranglehold of Moscow-based planners and officials. The assembly rejected a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> plan that would concede control over food and consumer products to the republics but retain control over energy and at least half of regional heavy industry. Another resolution demanded that national leaders recognize the `` Stalinist genocide'' in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and convene a trial of its perpetrators similar to the <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II. The Baltic republics were absorbed by the Soviets in 1940 in a secret deal between the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Hundreds of thousands of Baltic residents were deported or killed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, including 80,000 in 1941 alone, the assembly draft charges. In a separate closed-door meeting, 61 Baltic representatives elected in March to a new Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, hammered out a common platform to take to the inaugural session that begins May 25. In four resolutions, including an appeal to all congressional deputies, the Baltic lawmakers called for `` radical perestroika'' and asserted each republic's right to self-determination and choice of its own `` historical path.'' Perestroika refers to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of political reforms The appeal was designed `` to rally all progressive deputies wherever they may come from in order to find a common path to solve economic, social, and ecological problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON>. She told the assembly that the lawmakers also discussed formation of a coalition with other progressive congress deputies `` so the struggle for perestroika can go on.'' Such a coalition would be the first faction created in the new parliament.

 Grief returned Sunday to this close-knit community, which marked the first anniversary of a fiery bus crash that killed 24 teen-agers and three adults returning from a church outing. `` Anniversaries are always bad,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcherson </PERSON> said. `` And of course, it's Mother's Day, too. That will have quite an impact, I'm afraid.'' <PERSON> Hutcherson </PERSON> said thousands of people were expected for observances that were to include the unveiling of a monument listing the victims of one of the worst bus crashes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. A memorial service also was scheduled at a high school stadium. Because of parking limitations, those attended the observances were being brought in from local shopping centers on school buses. The irony was not lost on the Rev. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Denney </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think there ever will be a bus outing in this community that is planned without concern for that carefree outing that became so tragic,'' <PERSON> Denney </PERSON> said. The old school bus, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, was carrying 67 passengers home for a trip to a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> amusement Park when it was hit by a pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, Ky, on May 14, 1988. The truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, will be tried in November on 27 counts of murder and count of driving while intoxicated. The tragedy has prompted some in the community to campaign against drunken driving. `` This is a crusade for me,'' said Army Sgt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who lost his wife and two daughters in the crash. Others said their goal has been simply returning to a normal life. `` Drunk driving might be the worst thing in the world, but I ca n't do anything about it now,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Voglund </PERSON>, whose 13-year-old daughter was killed in the smashup. `` I'm still trying to distance myself from the whole thing because I feel better that way,'' he said. Although he still thinks about his daughter every day, <PERSON> Voglund </PERSON> said he has found an ally in the passage of time. `` You do n't feel nearly as lousy as you did six months ago,'' he said. `` We're probably eventually going to be in pretty good shape. Life does get better, or at least it has for us.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> is betting on Zvuki Mu, even though its flashy lead singer, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamonov </PERSON>, insists on singing in Russian. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is going with <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebenshikov </PERSON>, a rock' n' roll switch-hitter who can belt'em out in both Russian and English. It's all part of a rush by major entertainment companies to bring out albums by Soviet rock musicians. The companies hope the curiosity of Americans about contemporary <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> will sell records. They say the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era has made Soviet culture a hot product. But record executives have widely varying views of how authentic a sound the public will pay to hear. Some are deliberately Westernizing the music, prompting critics to say Americans are missing the real soundtrack of glasnost. At one end of the spectrum is <PERSON> Grebenshikov </PERSON>'s solo album `` Radio Silence,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> plans to release in June. Ten of the 12 songs are in English and were written especially for the album. All were recorded in the West by a successful British producer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the rock group the <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION>. It has poetic, dreamy lyrics that are not overtly political or even distinctively Russian in content. Aside from the raspy voice of the chain-smoking, pony-tailed <PERSON> Grebenshikov </PERSON>, `` Radio Silence'' bears little resemblance to his wildly popular <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> band Akvarium -LRB- Aquarium -RRB-, which has sold 3.5 million official albums and countless underground tapes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing, said <PERSON> Grebenshikov </PERSON> himself decided to do the album in English because, otherwise, the music's appeal `` obviously would have limitations.'' Some record companies, however, are taking the plunge into Russian lyrics. In late April, Opal-Warner Bros. released an album entirely in Russian by <PERSON> Zvuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> band whose name means `` Sounds of Mu'' _ a tongue-in-cheek tribute both to `` The Sound of Music'' and to the mooing of cows. Like <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Opal-Warner </PERSON> used a big-name Western producer, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Eno </PERSON>. But the recording was made in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> studio and preserved <PERSON> Zvuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>'s homegrown flavor, a blend of intellectual rock and funk. The initial 50,000 records, cassettes and compact disks have just reached the stores. <PERSON> Zvuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> is scheduled to bring its rambunctious stage act to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Lincoln Center in July. <PERSON> Grebenshikov </PERSON> also is planning a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, probably in the fall. Of all the new releases, perhaps the most authentic is `` Gruppa Krovi'' -LRB- Blood Type -RRB-, a collection of Russian protest songs and dance numbers by singer-poet <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsoi </PERSON> and his punk group <ORGANIZATION> Kino </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Cinema -RRB-. The album was recorded in the apartment of one of the band members. <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Stingray </PERSON>, an American singer married to <ORGANIZATION> Kino </ORGANIZATION> guitarist <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparyan </PERSON>, said she recently sat in a plush <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> restaurant with a group of Soviet rock performers reminiscing `` about the old days when they literally went hungry.'' Today, she said, top Soviet stars travel back and forth to the West and earn tens of thousands of dollars from record contracts, as well as commanding thousands of rubles per concert in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It used to be they could n't afford a taxi ride home at night,'' <PERSON> Stingray </PERSON> said. `` Now they are getting rich, at least by Soviet standards.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kino </ORGANIZATION>'s four-track recording was released in April by <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, a small <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> label, but has the muscle of <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>' distribution network behind it. `` We wanted to make sure it was the real Russian stuff,'' said Gold Castle promotion director <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiman </PERSON>. `` That seemed like the hippest thing to do.'' It is also the smallest release, at 10,000 copies, an example of the trade-off between artistic integrity and commercial success that worries <PERSON> Stingray </PERSON> and others on both sides of the rapidly parting Iron Curtain. <PERSON> Artemy </PERSON> <PERSON> Troitsky </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rock impresario, has warned that the newfound respectability of Soviet groups is fraught with peril, not only because the government could crack down at any time, but also because bands may be tempted to sell out. `` We've waited a long time for this, and it's a great day,'' <PERSON> Troitsky </PERSON> wrote in `` Back in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>,'' a history of Soviet rock published last fall. `` But previously, musicians exercised their creativity under the slogan ` We've Got Nothing To Lose,' and thus did n't think much about altering their work to ... win official prestige. `` Now, whether they recognize it consciously or not, the new conditions push them toward compromise.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> offers a classic example of the fickleness of politics this week as it considers a federal budget worked out in advance with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a minimum wage increase that sets lawmakers and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a collision course. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will demonstrate how cooperative they can be with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration when they consider the $ 1.17 trillion budget for fiscal 1990. Negotiators from the two chambers completed work on a final version of the plan last Thursday, and final passage of the spending plan is expected to be little more than an exercise in rubber-stamping. The budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, would hold natural resources, transportation, agriculture and veterans programs to growth rates below the rate of inflation. It would also limit defense spending to $ 299.2 billion, $ 4.2 billion below what would be needed to keep up with natural cost increases. But it would boost beyond inflation federal efforts for science, education, and health programs. A looming dispute between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrats over how to collect $ 5.3 billion in additional tax receipts has been postponed until later. Overall, the spending blueprint claims to compress the federal deficit to $ 99.7 billion _ just within the $ 100 billion limit set in the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. The harmony between the two branches was set in motion by a deficit-reduction deal they reached last month. But when it comes to their views on the minimum wage, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are anything but in harmony. Last Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation that would increase the $ 3.35-per-hour minimum wage to $ 4.55 by October 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is poised to pass a similar measure this week, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is already threatening veto. The White House prefers a version that would limit the increase to $ 4.25 by January 1992. Its version would also impose a subminimum wage for six months, as opposed to the 60-day training wage congressional Democrats prefer. Democrats seem unlikely to be able to muster the two-thirds majorities in both houses that would be needed to override a veto. But they are pressing the issue anyway in an attempt to position themselves politically as the friend of the country's working class. More fireworks could come when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers a domestic spending bill with money for this year. Most of the money in it is for veterans and for college loans, but the most controversial provision would provide about $ 300 million this year for anti-drug programs. Rep. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, chairman of the Appropriations justice subcommittee, has said he wants to pay for the spending by using part of the $ 650 million fine <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to pay for securities violations. Other lawmakers, however, believe spending cuts must be made in other programs to offset the drug spending. If the entire package contains too much new spending, administration officials have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might veto the measure. The final size of the bill will not be known until early this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also plans to vote on a resolution aimed at halting a proposed deal between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to jointly produce a new warplane. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to move ahead with the $ 7 billion arrangement, under which <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> would jointly produce the FSX fighter. The plane, a modernized version of the American F-16, would be deployed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the late 1990s. The question has sparked debate between supporters who stress the importance of U.S.-Japanese cooperation, and opponents who say the proposal would cost American jobs and constitute a giveaway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. A similar disapproval resolution has been introduced in the House. If the measures are passed and vetoed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it would take a two-thirds vote in each chamber to block the deal.

<TEXT>
 A Peace Initiative by the Government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> General: 1. This document presents the principles of a political initiative of the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> which deals with the continuation of the peace process, the termination of the state of war with the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, a solution for the Arabs of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Districts </LOCATION>, peace with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and a resolution of the problem of the residents of the refugee camps of the <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> Districts. 2.

Further details relating to the elections as well as other subjects of the initiative will be dealt with separately. Basic Premises: 3. The initiative is founded upon the assumption that there is a national consensus for it on the basis of the basic guidelines of the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including the following points: a. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> yearns for peace and the continuation of the political process by means of direct negotiations based on the principles of the Camp David Accords. b. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes the establishment of an additional Palestinian state in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and the area between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. c. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not conduct negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. d. There will be no change in the status of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the government. Subjects to be Dealt with in the Peace Process: 4. a. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views as important that the peace between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> based on the Camp David Accords will serve as a cornerstone for enlarging the circle of peace in the region, and calls for a common endeavor for the strengthening of the peace and its extension through continued consultations b. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> calls for the establishment of peace relations between it and those <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states which still maintain a state of war with it for the purpose of promoting a comprehensive settlement for the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, including recognition, direct negotiations, ending the boycott, diplomatic relations, cessation of hostile activity in international institutions or forums, and regional and bilateral cooperation. c. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> calls for an international endeavor to resolve the problem of the residents of the Arab refugee camps in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in order to improve their living conditions and to rehabilitate them. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is prepared to be a partner in this endeavor. d.

In these elections, a representation will be chosen to conduct negotiations for a transitional period of self-rule. This period will constitute a test for coexistence and cooperation. At a later stage, negotiations will be conducted for a permanent solution during which all the proposed options for an agreed settlement will be examined and peace between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> will be achieved. e. All the above mentioned steps should be dealt with simultaneously. f. The details of what have been mentioned in -LRB- section -RRB- d above will be given below. Principles Constituting the Initiative: Stages: 5. The initiative is based on two stages: a. Stage A: A transitional period for an interim agreement. b. Stage B: Permanent solution. 6. The interlock between the stages is a timetable on which the plan is built: The peace process delineated by the initiative is based on -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Resolutions 242 and 338 upon which the Camp David Accords are founded. Timetable: 7. The transitional period will continue for five years. 8. As soon as possible, but not later than the third year after the beginning of the transitional period, negotiations for achieving a permanent solution will begin.

 `` In the Upper Room'' a plotless ballet choreographed by <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> to music by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, is an exhilarating, athletic work that does n't give its American Ballet Theater dancers a moment to stop. The dancers at the Metropolitan Opera are forever twirling, traveling all over the stage. Watching `` In the Upper Room,'' one can be reminded of a time when male dancers lifted women, hands on their waists, and set them down again. In Saturday night's company premiere of `` In the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>,'' Miss <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> has choreographed seven ways to Sunday to lift ballerinas, including one in which the dancer rolls around the back of her partner's neck and slides down his other side. One of the most interesting variations has three ballerinas put their arms over each other's shoulders, facing the audience like a chorus line. Their partners pick them up, their legs dangling, without breaking the lineup. The dance has nine parts; tempos vary. One has to be familiar with Glass' music to discern melodies, but two of the sections sounded like his opera `` Akhnaten.'' The stage seemed to be in a fog, which sometimes poured from the wings and at other times was done by gray lighting by <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>. At first, the dancers were dressed in light gray with accents of red _ red shoes, red socks and red belts. As `` In the Upper Room'' progressed, costumes, designed by <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamali </PERSON>, became all or mostly red. <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> is artistic associate of the American Ballet Theater, having disbanded her <PERSON> Twyla </PERSON> <PERSON> Tharp </PERSON> Dance troupe. The evening began with `` Les Sylphides'' with elegant, effortless-looking dancing by <PERSON> Andris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liepa </PERSON>, a guest artist from the Bolshoi Ballet. His partners were <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>. The corps de ballet, dancing like a dream in floating white chiffon, is prominent in this 1908 ballet choreographed by <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fokine </PERSON> to <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON> music. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s `` Prodigal Son,'' choreographed in 1929 from the Bible story to Prokofiev music, had <PERSON> Danilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Radojevic </PERSON> dancing the title role with power and naivete. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> was glitteringly cold as the siren who tempts him, then tosses him to her minions to rob and beat.

In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have welcomed the apparent Sino-Soviet rapprochement as a step toward lowering global tension. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also applauded restraint that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities had shown in dealing with thousands of students demonstrating in the heart of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` We take note of the fact that the authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have really not, as they quite frequently have in the past, have not cracked down on these demonstrations. These students have been permitted to express their views rather freely, if you look at what has been traditional in the past,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added that `` we support freedom of expression around the world. We support self-determination, freedom of expression, democratization.''

<TEXT>
 A former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> goes on trial this week as an accomplice in the beating and hanging death of a young black man _ a crime that has already resulted in a death sentence against another man and a multimillion damage verdict for the victim's mother. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, 27, is charged with murder in the March 21, 1981, death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, 19, who was was abducted at random from a Mobile street as part of a Klan conspiracy. He faces up to life in prison. The killing led to a $ 7 million civil lawsuit verdict in 1987 that bankrupted the nation's oldest Klan group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klans </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Beulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, wound up acquiring the Klan's headquarters in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, the group's only major asset, in partial payment. Mrs. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> died last year. In 1983, Klan member <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in connection with the killing. And ironically, a black civil rights group intervened on behalf of <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, an offshoot of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, found an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lawyer willing to handle <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>' appeal. The group frequently intervenes on behalf of indigent death row inmates. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> faces the less serious charge of non-capital murder because prosecutors have described him as an accomplice. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, went on trial in February 1988 on murder charges, but the elder <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> collapsed in court, prompting a mistrial. This time, the two are being tried separately, with <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s trial scheduled to begin Monday. In the trial last year, the main prosecution witness was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> `` Tiger'' <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, who received a life prison sentence after he pleaded guilty in 1983 to a federal charge of violating <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s civil rights <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> told how he and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, 33, abducted <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> from a downtown street and then beat him, bound him and put him in the trunk of a car. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s body was found hanging in a tree in a residential neighborhood in Mobile. <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> provided a nylon rope used to hang <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. He also testified that the elder <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> ordered the killing of a black as revenge for the mistrial of a black man who was charged in the slaying of a white police officer in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. On Friday, a judge heard testimony at a hearing requested by attorneys seeking to get <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> a new trial. His attorney said he had new evidence that could warrant a new trial and also that <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> was provided ineffective counsel at his first trial.

 A former postmaster accused of shooting his wife and three sons to death and then trying to make it look as though the eldest son had done the killings was found guilty of murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences. Clinton County Judge <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> imposed the sentence Saturday on <PERSON> Bernon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> after jurors became deadlocked over what sentence to give the former postmaster from <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, in nearby <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> moved the trial here, because of pre-trial publicity. `` I'm very relieved,'' said <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, who could have received a death penalty from the jury. `` I'm still in a fog, really. I have n't had too much time to think about it.'' Shank, 41, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths last May of his wife, <PERSON> Charlaine </PERSON>, 37; and sons <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Bernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 3.

<TEXT>
 The new executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> insists that his conservative group's relocation to the birthplace of the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is nothing but a `` happy coincidence.'' Community leaders, who have long dissociated themselves from <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s reckless anti-communism, agree that it's a coincidence, although not one that makes everyone happy. `` It was more of an accident that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was born here and it's more of an accident that the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is moving here,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> professor who has written a book on the activities that led to <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s censure by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1954 The <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative political organization that emphasizes anti-communism and reducing the size of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, announced in March that it was closing its headquarters in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and moving them to <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, a city of 65,000 on the banks of the <LOCATION> Fox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in east-central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Employees are due to begin moving in this week. Since the announcement, city officials have repeatedly denied that the arrival of the society will affect the city's image. `` I do n't think anyone is frightened and certainly no one is alarmed,'' Mayor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anyone will be much affected by the coming of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. It's fairly esoteric We have people of all persuasions.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who was born in nearby Grand Chute, is not the only Appleton-area native who has gained the town some notoriety. In addition to the annual memorial at <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s grave in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, there is a seance each Halloween for the late magician and escape artist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>, who was born and raised here But those events, city officials say, are oddities in what is otherwise a typical <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> community, a Republican stronghold, that is gradually shedding its rural roots for a more urban economy. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has been mayor since 1980, calls it `` the best of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON>, 52, who stepped down as an executive at <ORGANIZATION> Secura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> to become executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the group chose <ORGANIZATION> Appleton </ORGANIZATION> as its new headquarters because he lives there, not because of the city's ties to conservatism or <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s legacy. However, he said, the fact that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was born there is a `` happy irony.'' `` We're quite pleased because Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was a great American, a stalwart of patriotism, a warrior of the evils of communism. It's a happy coincidence,'' he said. The society was founded in 1958 by 11 men, including <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grede </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Grede </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, a retired candy company executive. It was named after <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, a Baptist missionary and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> captain who was killed by Chinese communists a few days after World War II ended. The organization now claims `` several tens of thousands'' of members who meet in local chapters around the nation, <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON> said. He said the organization's militant anti-communism has given way to a less aggressive style, although he stressed that the society's underlying philosophy has n't changed <LOCATION> Outagamie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> VanderVelden </PERSON>, who led a futile fight to remove a life-size bust of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> from the courthouse in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> three years ago, said he's worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> leaders might try `` integrating their philosophies into state and local government.'' But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- and no relation to the <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> founder -RRB-, dismissed such worries. `` The last time I checked, the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> was n't advocating the violent overthrow of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said `` And quite frankly, if they have any problem it is that people do n't take them quite that seriously.''

<TEXT>
 When federal investigators open hearings this week into the nation's largest oil spill, they will be looking for answers to fundamental questions that so far have stymied authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives and crew members from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> all face scrutiny as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in five days of hearings beginning Tuesday, tries to solve these mysteries: _ Why did the 987-foot tanker stray far from estabished shipping lanes and rip its single-sheath bottom open on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, a well-charted obstacle about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> _ Was the captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, intoxicated at the time of the crash _ How long was the vessel stranded before the crew reported the accident to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ Did the crew's frenzied attempts to free the ship by `` rocking'' it off the reef widen the gash in the hull, spilling still more oil into the icy water _ Did the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and state officials react promptly to the emergency The board's final report wo n't be completed for nine to 12 months, board spokeswoman <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` We hope to determine the probable cause and make some safety recommendations,'' she said. Although the focus of attention shifts from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to the hearings in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> this week, the hard work continued Sunday in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> where the accident took place and where crews are still trying to clean fouled beaches. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> continued its reconnaissance flights over the spill. The flights were ordered to help halibut fishermen avoid polluted areas on Monday, when their 24-hour commercial season opens. `` Oil sightings will be relayed to fishermen by radio,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Whatever we've got, we're using. C-130s, helicopters, whatever.'' It has been nearly two months since the catastrophe changed life in what had been a quiet fishing village. The trouble began shortly after midnight on March 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, its 13 tanks filled with North Slope crude from the trans-Alaska pipeline, slammed into a reef shrouded in darkness. The crippled vessel quickly began hemorrhaging oil _ by latest estimate, 10.9 million gallons _ into the pristine waters of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The sound, named after the third son of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, is one of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s most popular and scenic recreational areas, teeming with animals, fish and birds. The huge vessel, apparently maneuvering to avoid the glittering ice chunks cast into the sound by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION>, swerved from its outbound lane and across the incoming zone, then continued miles off course toward the submerged, jagged outcropping. Minutes before the crash the crew, apparently aware that their vessel was at risk, frantically tried to avoid the reef, according to an analysis of radio traffic between the Exxon Valdez and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Then, in the words of helmsman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> went for `` a bumpy ride.'' As its massive hull scraped along the reef, it scooped up boulders the size of automobiles and stuffed them into its huge oil tanks. `` We've fetched hard aground. ... We're leaking oil. We're going to be here a while. I just wanted to make a report,'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> radioed shortly after 12:20 a.m.. As he spoke, the crude gushed into the water In the more than seven weeks since the crash, oil has spread some 450 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, fouling shorelines throughout Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and along the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast to <LOCATION> Wide </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The oiled beaches include those of the spectacular Katmai National Park. To probe the accident, the transportation board has assembled what it describes as a panel of inquiry _ one board member to conduct the proceedings, staff members and investigators to sift the evidence and representatives of each ofthe four parties having a direct interest in the proceedings. Those are the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry's jointly owned company that operates the 800-mile-long trans-Alaska pipeline. The chairman for the hearings is <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickenson </PERSON>, the only member of the board who will be present in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the full board will consider the evidence developed from the <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> testimony. Unlike a court of law, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s rules specifically bar lawyers from posing questions. Instead, representatives of each of the four parties at interest directly question the witnesses, as does <PERSON> Dickenson </PERSON>. Crew members from the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> are scheduled to testify first, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel, representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, and winding up on the final day with more <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials. One person who wo n't be at the hearings is <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who declined to testify but who offered information in writing to the board. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has been charged in an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> court with three misdemeanor counts that include operating a vessel while drunk, and his trial is scheduled to begin June 20 in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>.

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged graduates of tiny <ORGANIZATION> Bennett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday to heed the example set by 19th century black activist <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> and help people `` enslaved by ignorance'' to become educated members of society. `` Someday in your lives, the walls will part and you'll see a little <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a commencement address at the predominantly black, liberal arts college for women. `` I hope that you will remember the abiding principles and values that we learned when we were young and I hope you will say, ` I want to be fair and I want to share.' It can be done and I want to help you do it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by the college, which was founded in 1873. In her speech, said <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> had been one of her heroes since she read the autobiography of the one-time slave who became a scholar and writer. She said she was particularly struck by <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>' account of overhearing his owner admonishing his wife not to teach slaves how to read because doing so would make them impossible to control. `` <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>' revelation holds true today,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There are many types of slavery, and education is the key to freedom.'' The first lady, who is active in literacy programs and is honorary chairperson of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, challenged the 92 graduates to `` help the young, modern <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglasses </PERSON> out there today who are enslaved by ignorance. Help them learn their A-B-C's and escape,'' she said. The ceremony was held beneath overcast skies on the school's grassy quadrangle, lined with oak trees Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked at the rear of the procession, wearing a black academic gown and cap and a triple trand of pearls. As she approached the dais, a child handed her a dozen red roses. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the mother of five and grandmother of 11, said her honorary doctorate was `` a wonderful Mother's Day present for me.'' Her speech was laced with jokes about children, but she said the basic lessons learned in early childhood form the basis of adult character. She also challenged the graduates to follow the example of <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who despite being an orphan, graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Bennett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1941 and went on to become a surgeon and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> legislator. She quoted Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as having said, `` I have n't accepted defeat, not my entire life. The speech was the only commencement address Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver this year, according to press secretary <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The first lady chose to accept <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s invitation because she met the college's president, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, in a White House Rose Garden ceremony earlier this year.

 Floodwaters began to recede slowly Sunday after <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s swollen rivers gave residents in low-lying areas a scare without causing major damage. While spectators lined riverbanks to gawk and take pictures of the high water, meteorologists continued to keep a close watch on levels of the rain-filled waterways, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Several families living along the <LOCATION> Androscoggin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> had been asked to evacuate their homes as water filled basements and forced the shutoff of electric utilities on Saturday. On Sunday, police said they had no reports of evacuations having taken place. `` It's nothing major at all,'' said <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>. `` It's not nearly what it was back in'87,'' when floods caused tens of millions of dollars in damage across <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. This weekend, spectators casually watched the Androscoggin's waters rush over <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and cascade onto rocks below in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>'s downtown section Rising waters flooded several roads in central and southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, but none was reported blocked as of Sunday. In <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, Road Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said damage was worse than during the April 1987 flood. Sections of some roads were washed away in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> rose to the doors of some businesses on Saturday. But by Sunday afternoon, the river had backed away. `` It has since receded and we're damn glad it did,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, owner of the Speakeasy Restaurant and Pub in <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON>. `` We're happy we've seen the worst of it.''

<HEAD>At Shrine, Mother's Day Draws 200 Visitors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The oldest mother who's a regular at the International Mother's Day Shrine is easy to shop for this time of year. `` Usually they send flowers, but I told them if I could n't eat it or wear it, do n't send it,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who at 98 was the oldest mother attending Sunday's services at the church where Mother's Day began in 1908. Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s 71-year-old son, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is a member of the Grafton Mother's Day committee. The committee's roots go back 81 years, to the time when <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION> wanted to set aside a day to honor her mother, also named <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, who had organized a Mothers Friendship Day after the Civil War to unite families who had split because of the conflict. When Mrs. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> died on May 9, 1905, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> became determined to establish Mother's Day. On May 10, 1908, the first Mother's Day service was held in <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has since become the International Mother's Day Shrine and is used only for Mother's Day services and an occasional wedding. This year, the Sunday services attracted about 200 visitors, not quite enough to fill up the church, said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON>, the director of the shrine for six years. This year marks the 75th anniversary of federal recognition for Mother's Day. And if the holiday seems overly commercialized today, it's interesting to note that its founder was concerned about that decades ago. Like Mrs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the younger <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> did n't want to see flowers deliverered on Mother's Day. `` They're commercializing my Mother's Day,'' she once wrote to newspapers. `` I wanted it to be a day of sentiment, not of profit. `` Flowers are about half-dead by the time they're delivered. You ought to give your mother something useful, something permanent. `` A maudlin and insincere printed card or a ready-made telegram means nothing except that you're too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone else in the world.''

 Army Spec. 4 <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and his buddies got a hot and humid welcome to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as they began to settle into their posts Sunday near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. `` It's only 8 a.m. and it already feels like the hottest day of the year in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' said the <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> man as he ate breakfast near a row of 10 armored personnel carriers. `` You guys ever have any breeze here?'' he asked. It was only 85 degrees, but <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and 150 men from the 5th Infantry Division were camped in a steamy, windless jungle clearing. They are among the nearly 1,900 fresh troops dispatched by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to assure the security of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations and American citizens. They arrived Saturday from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and Sunday morning they were oiling and cleaning equipment following an intense tropical downpour during the night. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who said he was a history student, said he was familiar with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I know that for once, we are here to support democracy. It did n't use to be that way in the past.

<TEXT>
 Police and lawmakers on Sunday condemned a wave of fan violence that broke out on the last full day of the English soccer season. Authorities arrested 255 fans during and after the matches. The incidents Saturday and early Sunday came less than a month after 95 fans died during an April 15 stampede at a soccer game at Hillsborough Stadium in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. `` What happened last night has brought the game back to its knees,'' charged <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Luton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> club. Fellow Conservative parliamentarian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> called the violence a `` weekend of shame that reinforces the government's determination to clean up soccer and rid the country forever of the scourge of the football hooligan. On Saturday, fans poured onto the field and briefly stopped the Crystal Palace-Birmingham City match. Twenty-four fans were arrested on charges that included drunkenness, threatening, assault and drug possession. Sixteen people were hospitalized and two were kept overnight, one suffering from knife wounds, police said. Later Saturday, 42 <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> fans were arrested after they smashed dishes and furniture at a roadside diner in <LOCATION> Toddington </LOCATION>, police said. `` The youths started charging about ... throwing people and furniture about,'' said a <LOCATION> Bedfordshire </LOCATION> police spokesman on condition of anonymity. About 200 youths _ mainly <ORGANIZATION> Sheffield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> supporters _ went on the rampage in <ORGANIZATION> Weston-super-Mare </ORGANIZATION> after seeing their team beaten 2-0 at <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police said 27 people were arrested for fighting and breaking windows. Elsewhere, 44 <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> supporters were arrested after a bar fight after a match in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>. A 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> man was hospitalized with serious head injuries, police said. At <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, 57 <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> fans were arrested after trouble around the <LOCATION> Fratton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> stadium, and 11 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> supporters were arrested for disorderly conduct on a train headed for a match at <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION>. Police on Sunday arrested 50 passengers aboard a bus chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION> fans. Authorities said about 30 of the drunken fans had gone to a party in <LOCATION> Tewkesbury </LOCATION> on their way home from a match and had injured two guests. Police in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> said the behavior of the town's fans at <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suggested they had short memories. `` One wonders, in the light of -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> -LRB- stampede -RRB-, what on earth these mindless idiots were thinking of,'' said deputy chief constable <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> used his good looks and claims of clairvoyance to charm <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s elite and attract drug traffickers and cultists willing to do anything for their `` godfather,'' a newspaper reported. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, who ordered his own execution and that of companion <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> as police closed in May 6 on his <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residence, has been linked to as many as 24 slayings _ 15 that were discovered last month outside <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and many that included ritualistic sacrifices. Those who knew him said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> built a career as a reader to the stars, The Dallas Morning News reported in Sunday's editions. His clients included top-ranking police and government officials and popular entertainers, according to statements last week by his family, followers and authorities. Some clients paid as much as $ 8,000 a session for his predictions and ritual `` cleansings'' that promised good luck, family members told the newspaper. `` He would tell rich people what to do, how to make things better, and since what he would say would happen, they would pay him $ 30,000 or $ 40,000,'' said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Authorities depict <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, as a bisexual who had affairs with several members of his cult and wore rubies, sapphires and diamonds on every finger, drove a 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and twice bought a boyfriend $ 10,000 worth of clothes in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Delia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, described her son as a homebody who kept a neat house, cared about his family and had few close friends as a youngster. But, she said, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> had striking good looks, charisma and what appeared to his admirers to be an ever-increasing clairvoyance. `` People were always asking, ` Who's that?' _ everybody believing he was somebody and asking if he's a movie star,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told The Morning News. `` He had cachet.'' And, she said, `` he knew things.'' A high school dropout, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> predicted former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be shot in 1980, but would survive, Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. He predicted a great tragedy was coming to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> just months before the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake of 1985. The son of teen-age <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> but moved to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> as an infant with his mother after his parents divorced. The family returned to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when he was 10 to seek medical care for his stepfather, who died of cancer in 1973. At 14, <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> fathered a child by his 13-year-old girlfriend and dropped out of high school. He also began claiming to have out-of-body experiences, healing the sick and predicting the future, the paper reported. He did odd jobs until he landed a modeling job in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1984. There he fathered another child and began attracting clients for his readings _ including such celebrities, cult members say, as pop singer <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Athie </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrana </PERSON> and renowned hairstylist <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>. All of them have denied any link to the cult. <PERSON> Athie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>'s followers harassed him for more than a year because he rejected their requests to perform in concert and pay for a ritual cleansing. `` They said that they were witches and that <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> had powers, and for $ 2,000 or $ 3,000 I could be cleansed for good luck,'' <PERSON> Athie </PERSON> told the newspaper. When he refused, <PERSON> Athie </PERSON> said `` they became angry and called back to say that I was going to die slowly of a serious illness.'' Authorities believe <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> performed several human sacrifices _ including as many as nine in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area _ in addition to revenge killings. Cult member <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> said members would stand around an altar, sometimes blindfolded, while <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> killed his victim. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> would allow members to dismember the corpse. Members of the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> drug-smuggling family told police <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> offered them protection from their enemies _ police, rival drug gangs and feuding family members _ in return for 50 percent of the profits.

 The first exhibit to bring together works by contemporary Soviet and American artists opened to eager viewers Sunday at the Modern Art Museum. The exhibition, called 10 Plus 10, includes 60 paintings by 20 artists _ 10 from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 10 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It will be the first such exhibit to tour both nations. Chief curator <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said more than 200 visitors came through the doors in the first hour of the exhibit's debut. Modern Art Museum Director E.A. <PERSON> Carmean </PERSON> said the show is the first chance the Soviets have had to help organize and take part in touring shows. `` They want to participate,'' <PERSON> Carmean </PERSON> said. `` They want to change the rules about exhibition touring. And we got there just when they decided they wanted to change them.'' In November 1985, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed an agreement to further cultural exchanges, work was already under way in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> for such an exhibition. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> InterCultura </ORGANIZATION>, a Fort Worth-based museum services group, had been talking to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials about the possibility of U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges. In June 1987, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, and returned with several ideas for an exhibition, including a show of contemporary art. The exhibition came together over cookies and tea when <PERSON> Carmean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> met <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> in February 1988. `` 10 Plus 10 epitomizes cultural dialogue more clearly than any other exhibition we've done,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The exhibition is a direct dialogue between two completely different cultures that are meeting each other for the first time.'' A $ 150,000 grant from the Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> helped underwrite 10 Plus 10. The exhibit includes works by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as well as <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleckner </PERSON>, <PERSON> April </PERSON> <PERSON> Gornick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemieux </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdum </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Salle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tansey </PERSON>, all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Soviet exhibitors are <PERSON> Yurii </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mironenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yurii </PERSON> <PERSON> Petruk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Purygin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Roiter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shutov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexsei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundukov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anatolii </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuravlev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvezdochetov </PERSON>. After 10 Plus 10 closes in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> on Aug. 6, it will travel to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man shot at a police jeep in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Sunday, wounding two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officers before being shot and wounded himself, hospital officials and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. In the occupied lands, two Palestinians accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were reported killed by fellow Palestinians. Also Sunday, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 21 Arabs, mostly teen-agers, in stone-throwing clashes, and a 10-year-old boy was injured by a rubber bullet, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital reports said. An assailant opened fire with a pistol on the police vehicle near <LOCATION> Hefzi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bah </LOCATION>, a settlement 50 miles northest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and hospital officials said. They said the vehicle was carrying a bomb expert and a Civil Guard volunteer. The Palestinian, identified as being from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Araba </LOCATION>, jumped from roadside bushes and `` emptied the whole magazine, standing there like a Rambo,'' the radio quoted one officer as saying. The bomb expert drew his pistol and fired, wounding the attacker in the stomach and head, the radio reported. `` This man lost a lot of blood from the head ... His condition is hopeless,'' said <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahima </PERSON>, an emergency service medic. He said the two officers suffered only minor arm wounds. A <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Awdeh </PERSON>, 60, died of stab wounds received Saturday in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salit </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports confirmed by the army. <PERSON> Awdeh </PERSON> was attacked by masked youths who accused him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, the reports said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakawi </PERSON>, 22, was found dead near <LOCATION> Khan-Yunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fakawi </PERSON> died of stab wounds, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said he was suspected of being an army collaborator. More than 40 Palestinians have been killed as collaborators by fellow Arabs. The latest deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed in the 17-month uprising against the Israeli occupation to 474. Twenty-one Israelis have also been killed. In other violence, stone-throwing clashes erupted in seven <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps and towns, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals reported 18 wounded, mostly teen-agers. A 10-year-old was hit in the cheek by a rubber bullet, they said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, three teen-agers were shot in clashes in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camps, doctors said. The army said it was checking the reports. In southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Jews enraged over the death of a soldier blamed on Palestinians stoned Arabs' vehicles, injuring one of the drivers and damaging nine cars, witnesses said. The Jews mounted their attacks along a road from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to retaliate for the death of <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportaz </PERSON>, whose body was found last week.

 Silent film actress <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a small-town girl who went on to become a <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennett </PERSON> bathing beauty and <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s co-star in the classic `` The General,'' has died. She was 87. Miss <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> died May 1 of heart failure after a lingering heart condition. She was buried Saturday in a private service. Miss <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, whose real name was <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> McCreery </PERSON>, was born in Mammoth, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and came to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in April 1920. `` I went to <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennett </PERSON>'s studio and they gave me a job right away at $ 25 a week,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in a 1987 interview. As a bathing beauty, she appeared in a number of short films, then went on to make comedies and features for other studios before writing and starring in a semi-autobiographical film, `` <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of the Movies.'' She eventually adopted the screen name <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. Her best-known role was in <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s 1926 Civil War comedy, `` The General,'' in which she played his estranged girlfriend, <PERSON> Annabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who is accidentally kidnapped by <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> spies. She later abandoned acting to write scripts for her husband, producer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewyn </PERSON>. In 1949, she entered the real estate business and moved to <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, settling that year in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewyn </PERSON> died in 1969. `` The General'' was a critical and financial failure at the time of its release but is now considered <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s masterpiece. When interest in the film revived in the 1970s, Miss <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was tracked down by a film historian and made the rounds of film festival screenings until illness forced her to quit. `` I enjoyed going back to traveling with the movie and being an actress again,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is survived by her son, a stepsister and three grandchildren.

<HEAD>No. 3 House Democrat Amends Report on Junk Bond Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> acknowledged Sunday that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment that netted the congressman a $ 6,882 profit without him having to put up any of his own money. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> released a detailed report of the arrangement, in which the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L executive purchased the $ 100,000 in bonds for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and held them until <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could raise money to pay for them, in part with a loan subsequently obtained from the executive's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L. Except for some reporting errors, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said, the 1986 deal was `` totally above board.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman _ as majority whip the No. 3 Democrat in the House _ released his attorney's review of the financial transaction. The review was begun after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last month first reported on <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s investment in the high yield bonds. According to the report, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> first considered investing his 1986 campaign funds in 12 -LCB- percent bonds, based on a suggestion by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assn </ORGANIZATION>. of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> ruled out that type purchase for his campaign, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> himself could make an investment in the bonds, which were being issued for a corporate takeover. When <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> could not come up with the $ 100,000 by the required purchase date of May 5, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> bought the bonds himself and held them for a month while <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> completed his financing _ half of which came from <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>'s bank. At that point, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> bought the bonds from <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> and paid him interest equivalent to what the bonds made during that period. When the congressman sold the bonds in October, 1986, he was able to pay back his loans and realize a $ 6,882 profit in four months. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, concluded that <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s role could not be construed as a `` gift'' which would violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, since <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> paid him interest. He also said the original issuing of the bond to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s campaign committee, instead of the congressman, was a clerical error. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said the report was given Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, which routinely reviews <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> financial reporting compliance. He said the amended financial disclosure was to be filed Monday. There is no indication whether the ethics committee is considering or plans to review the bond purchase. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> insisted in his statement that the deal was proper but said he regretted it. `` The report shows that although my purchase of the bonds was lawful, appropriately financed and that no questions about ` gifts' can be fairly raised, my 1986 financial disclosure form was incomplete and contained some reporting errors,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said `` I am accepting without reservations the conclusion of my legal counsel that the purchase of the bonds was totally above board,'' he said. `` Public officials are today, however, living in a period of intense questioning. ... With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this transaction.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who has ambitions of climbing higher in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership, last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust. `` My greatest regret is not having gotten into the blind trust sooner,'' he said Sunday. <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said the congressman's staff had spent a month `` to understand fully and reconstruct this transaction'' instead of releasing details piecemeal. He said the effort did not include checking whether <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> had any interest in legislation, because that is only an issue if <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> had conferred a gift. `` We do n't think it's going to end up as a big deal,'' he said of the transaction.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> on Sunday welcomed <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s return to the Arab fold, saying <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s expected participation at an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> was a positive development Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jibran </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourieh </PERSON> issued a statment saying `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> supports and approves the return of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to its natural place in the struggle'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was isolated from the 22-member Arab League and most Arab nations severed relations with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> after it signed the Camp David peace accords with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979.

<HEAD>Radiation Fear Forces Closing Of Summer Camp Near Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 67-year-old children's summer camp located two miles from a uranium processing plant closed Sunday because of concerns over radiation poisoning. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION>, announced last month it would permanently close the retreat near the federal government's Fernald uranium plant. Residents of the area surrounding the camp have filed a $ 300 million class-action lawsuit against the former operators of the plant, contending they allowed radioactive dust to contaminate local land, water and air for three decades. The Energy Department has conceded that figures released in past years measuring the amount of radiation were too low. It is revising them. The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons-making facilities. The camp in <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, opened in 1922 and provided recreation for more than 150,000 campers over the years. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonekamp </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said she disagreed with the decision to close the facility. `` We felt there was no danger with the environment,'' she said. `` We'd had the water and soil tested each year -LRB- for uranium contamination -RRB-, and it was always fine.'' The advisory board had suspended operations at the camp for the summer because of dwindling enrollment, but hoped the enrollment might bounce back the next year.

<HEAD>North Jury Forewoman Was Cousin of Prosecutor's Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The jury forewoman in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial said her undisclosed kinship to the secretary of a prosecutor in the case did not affect her judgment or her decisions. `` She knew her job, and I knew mine. Just because she worked for -LRB- prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> did n't mean diddlywink,'' forewoman <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in an interview in the May 22 issue of People magazine. In a courthouse elevator during the trial, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> bumped into <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a cousin who Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had learned was working as a secretary for <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the two did not discuss the case and she did not report the meeting or the relationship to Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The forewoman and her 11 fellow jurors found <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> colonel and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer, guilty of three felony counts and acquitted him of nine others. In the interview, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a 34-year-old hospital administrative secretary, said reaching the decision was a stressful, nerve racking and divisive process that left her feeling alienated from the other jurors. `` A lot of times I would come back to my -LRB- hotel -RRB- room, shut the door and just cry,'' she said. When she requested additional copies of the judge's instructions and trial evidence, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said some of her colleagues were angered. `` Some people fought me on it. They did n't want to read. They did n't want to discuss,'' she told the magazine. Later, when she asked for larger quarters in which to work without consulting the other jurors, `` they began cussing me out.'' `` We did n't have time for politeness,'' she said. `` A man's life was in our hands.'' The panel could n't even agree on rest breaks. `` I figured we were taking too much time off, -LRB- but -RRB- they wanted to take more breaks and goof off,'' she said. In the end, she said, her prodding paid off. The jury `` did the work because they realized it was important,'' and `` we had some good conversations and good arguments.'' She said the jurors saw <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a scapegoat who followed the orders of his bosses. She admitted she was concerned about the stiff sentence North faces, including 10 years in jail and $ 750,000 in fines.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday overcame deep divisions and endorsed Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s 20-point plan for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The plan passed by a 20-6 vote after an intense seven-hour debate. It calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate on a plan for eventual self-rule, but specifically rules out negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will oppose creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. Many Palestinian leaders rejected the plan. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee would meet `` and then we may have a response to the plan. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership must look over the main points before we will have any comment.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> called the vote a `` great victory'' for the 73-year-old premier. `` It is the first time the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have been able to unite behind one plan,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Observers suggested one reason for the positive vote by the fractious coalition was that the plan sidestepped controversial issues, such as Palestinian demands for international supervision of elections and for the participation of the 140,000 Arabs in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Another <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, said approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli parliament, was not necessary for the plan. The Likud-Labor coalition has a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said the key question is whether an Arab partner could be found for negotiations. He said this would be the focus of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' forthcoming trip to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> for 45 minutes after the Cabinet session. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> would return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Tuesday and confer with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Arab reactions. Most prominent Palestinians reacted negatively to the plan, although <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> picked up support from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, considered a moderate, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arabic TV that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan is a `` worthy idea if it is fairly conducted under international supervision with the consent of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the participation of the residents of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' The plan calls for elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> with candidates chosen from districts. Those elected would negotiate self-rule for the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of the territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said that under the plan the occupied territories would be divided into 10 districts with each district represented by one person in the elected body. After three years, talks would start on a permanent settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, with the same local negotiators playing a `` central role.'' The settlement would be in the context of a treaty between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON>, a leading Palestinian, criticized the plan because it called for a treaty with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, not with Palestinians. Five prominent Palestinians sent a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consul-General <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> opposing the plan. `` We find the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposal ... grossly deficient in as much as it is not part of a political process that leads clearly to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,'' they wrote. The Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a hard-line faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, called the plan a `` false enterprise'' aimed at undermining the Palestinian uprising and plans for an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, a leader of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and author of key elements of the plan, said the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vote meant that after a long period of paralysis, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had a `` serious and practical plan.'' Communications Minister <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacobi </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, said `` I think the Palestinians would be crazy not to accept the possibility of electing representatives, a delegation to talk to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about their own future.'' The daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> believed elections could be held within one year, while <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> estimated six months were needed. Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> led right-wing opposition to the proposal, arguing it would intensify the Palestinian uprising, divide <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and lead to creation of a Palestinian state. `` This plan ... carries a clear recipe for more violence, more terrorism and even a danger of war,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. At least 474 Palestinians have died in the 17-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty-one Israelis have died. Two Palestinians accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials were found dead Sunday, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital reports said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers wounded at least 22 Arabs, including a 10-year-old boy hit with a plastic bullet.

 A harsh midday sun beat down Sunday on hunger-striking students in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Some napped after a sleepless night of chanting and singing; others sat listless amid discarded plastic water bottles and torn newspapers. Then the first stirring musical notes broke the calm. The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION>' glee club had arrived. Several dozen students, led by their conductor, lined up in front of the strikers and began to sing the `` Internationale,'' the socialist anthem that has become the hit song of the month-long students' democracy movement. Heads raised, a few strikers joined in. The glee club sang the anthem a few times and the performance ended to cries of `` Thank you!''

 Speaking of singing. Late Sunday, students demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> address them from the center of Tiananmen Square. But what could they say to appease the student anger over corruption and official incompetance? `` Make them sing,'' said one student. `` And make it the Internationale,'' said another.

 Students from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> donned white coats and arm bands and established a first-aid squad. `` The first symptoms will be headache,'' said one young man, who like many others feared to give his name because of possible reprisal. He and his colleagues set up shop amid boxes containing aspirin, packets of Chinese medicines and bottles of glucose. `` We'll be needed,'' they predicted early in the first full day of the hunger strike, and they were. As a strong sun blazed down on the square the first-aid team moved among their fellow students and handed out pills. `` If they fall down fainting, and they are in real danger, we'll send them out,'' said one member `` But if someone insists on persisting and wo n't go, we have to accept it.'' At least 10 students were carried Sunday afternoon to a nearby city ambulance, suffering from dehydration and too much sun.

 Workers who have cheered the students during earlier protests and occasionally accompanied them demonstrated their support again. Two groups with about 200 people in each each paraded around the square before dawn Monday under banners proclaiming themselves the `` Capital Workers Group'' and chanted, `` Long live the students!'' Several joined the hunger strikers. `` I've been marching with the students since -LRB- April -RRB- 18th,'' said a fasting construction worker. `` My boss has chewed me out.. and my wife opposes it too. But I'm concerned about democracy. We workers should be the masters.'' He said other workers `` are waiting. If there is bloodshed, they will rise up.''

 What some people call `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fever'' has yet to invade <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media and public are praising the Soviet leader in connection with this week's summit. `` We hope our leaders will learn from him,'' said a middle-aged man who lauded President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness. The Soviets `` even had election protests,'' the man said. `` We have n't come that far.'' The summit symbolizes the end of a 30-year rift between the two communist giants. The Chinese government, however, has maintained a low-key attitude toward the historic meeting. It appears determined to assure Western countries that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has no intention of restoring the close ties it had with the Soviets in the 1950s. In the week leading up to the summit, state-run newspapers began publishing a few articles on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, but little was said of the summit. The People's Daily, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, carried a glowing profile of Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Sunday, writing of her beauty, intelligence and `` vivacious personality.'' National television broadcast a program Sunday night on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his family. But on the national evening news, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> followed reports on a steel conference and a student hunger strike at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Despite the lack of coverage <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents are aware of the summit and the Soviet leader's experiments in allowing greater political and cultural debate. Demonstrating students who are demanding a free press and greater political freedom view <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms with special interest. About 6,000 students signed a letter delivered Saturday to the Soviet Embassy inviting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to speak to them at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The embassy said it would deliver the letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but his schedule during the three-day <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> visit is tight. <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students at the Tiananmen Square protest referred to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some East European countries as examples of a worldwide trend toward democratization. They said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be affected. `` The mainstream is moving toward economic liberalization and political democratization,'' they declared in a manifesto read at the square. `` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has realized a relatively high level of democracy compared to other socialist countries.'' There seems to be little public animosity or suspicion toward the country that the official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media lashed for many years as a war-mongering territory grabber. `` If they demobilize some of the troops from their border and we demobilize some of ours, we'll reduce the burden of military spending,'' said a young man on a bicycle. `` Of course, in foreign relations, two countries always use each other, do n't they?'' he addeds. `` I'm sure we're willing to use the Soviets if we can.''

<TEXT>
 Churchgoers applauded nationwide Sunday when Roman Catholic clergy read a letter condemning electoral fraud and violence, and opposition supporters staged brief, peaceful protests. The pastoral letter, which urged Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s Defense Forces not to use arms against `` a defenseless people,'' also was read during a service broadcast on state-run television At churches across the capital and in other <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> cities, worshipers waved white handerkerchiefs, paper, and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> flags. Opposition supporters handed out leaflets urging similar displays during a general strike called Wednesday to protest fraud during the May 7 election and violence by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's de facto ruler. `` We must say ` no' to all of this corruption and ` yes' to liberty and justice,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON> at Cristo Rey church. The congregation chanted `` Justice, Justice'' and waved white handkerchiefs when opposition vice presidential candiates <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> walked in. In brief comments to reporters after services, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said rumors were being spread about a political settlement involving a power-sharing junta. However, he rejected the idea. `` Nothing doing No playing with the popular will of the people,'' he declared. `` The only solution begins with recognition of the May 7 election. Nothing more, nothing less,'' he said. The opposition has said it will negotiate only with the military, because it does not recognize the current government. It has said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can join talks, but only with the understanding that any agreement will call for him to leave. The opposition's presidential candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, remained hospitalized, recovering from injuries sustained when he, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were beaten by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters Wednesday. At <LOCATION> Iglesia </LOCATION> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, in an affluent neighborhood of the capital, the congregation applauded for several minutes after the pastoral letter was read. Members of the congregation waved white paper, white handkerchiefs and Panamanian flags. The same was true at churches in the poor neighborhoods of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abajo </LOCATION>, and in the cities of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, about 200 miles west, and <LOCATION> Colon </LOCATION>, 50 miles to the north. In the past, such services have been broken up by gunfire from police. One leaflet being distributed outside churches asked members of the congregation to stop playing the national lottery or going to the race track, because that money helps the government. Meanwhile, nearly 1,900 newly deployed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops dispatched by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> settled into tents around bases a few miles from the city. `` This place is nice from what I've seen. I talked to some Panamanians last night, and I doubt if they'll have to use us,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of the 5th Division from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deployed the troops following widespread reports of fraud during the presidential vote and the violence against the opposition candidates. They will back up the 10,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers already in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Opposition leaders say <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> easily defeated <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand-picked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, in the presidential race The government nullified the election results. Televised church services were followed by a weekly news program produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which include the police and military. An announcer read a brief statement saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has forgotten that a small and weak society also has its dignity.'' `` When the drums of war sound from the White House ... we are ready to give our lives for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' it said. One normal feature of the program was omitted: a summary of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s week. Instead, an old tape of a visit <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was broadcast. The pastoral letter was issued Thursday by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and other bishops of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and was read by <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> clergy nationwide. There had been some doubt the government would permit it to be read on the government-controlled television's normal Sunday Mass broadcast. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> did not appear at the service as he usually does, but the letter was read by a lay person. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> was celebrating Mass at an undisclosed location, a spokeswoman for the church said. Church support for fair elections is a new factor in the political equation here, where the church has not been as influential as it is in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted for drug trafficking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been trying to remove him for more than a year. Wednesday's general strike is to coincide with a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss the Panamanian situation. The Panamanian government maintains the meeting should focus on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The opposition says the meeting should focus on election fraud and political repression. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is due to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Monday following his recall by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Mexican and Venezuelan envoys also are being recalled.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has been compared to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, but she says her historical counterpart is actually an American. `` You go back to the person who really had to fight for what he believed in and _ I could n't begin to compare myself with him _ it was <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' she said in an interview in the June issue of Vanity Fair magazine. The daughter of a small-town grocer, <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> married and had twins while studying to become a lawyer. When her children were 6, she was elected to parliament for the first time and went on to lead the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Now in her third term as prime minister, she has a reputation for toughness that has earned her the nickname `` Iron Lady.'' `` I'm driven to be confrontational,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> Vanity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have had to learn to be combative to get it across. Of course, when you're a woman and you're combative they say you're an iron lady. Let me tell you, if you had n't got a spine which was strong and firm, and a will which was strong and firm, we would never have got through.'' She also quotes Rudyard Kipling: `` ` Being a female of the species is more deadly than the male.' So it's nothing unusual _ it's just that people have got this strange thing that to be strong you have to be a man.''

<HEAD>Government Opens Detour to Bypass Rebel-threatened Highway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of trucks on Sunday rumbled along a dirt road built to bypass a section of the major supply route to the capital that is frequently cut by anti-communist rebels. The 18-mile detour runs across flat planes, unlike the main <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway that weaves through the mountains between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Soviet border, 260 miles away. Soldiers stationed at a checkpoint on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said the new road was opened Wednesday and it has been used by more than 1,000 privately operated trucks. They said about 200 trucks reached <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> Sunday. There are government checkpoints every 1.5 miles along the detour, according to the soldiers. Guerrillas in the mountains north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> often attacked convoys on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, causing a shortage of food, fuel and other essential supplies in the capital. `` The government controls this road,'' said one driver, 42-year-old Ghulabb, as his truck passed through the checkpoint to enter <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The truck was hauling three cars and auto parts with firewood, bags of rice and cans of gasoline piled on top. <PERSON> Ghulabb </PERSON>, who uses only one name, said he left the Soviet border Friday and made the journey to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in two days. But finding drivers to make the hazardous trip is difficult and owners must pay high wages to ge supplies delivered. <PERSON> Ghulabb </PERSON> said he earns the equivalent of about $ 500 per month, which is more than double the average annual income in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Ghulabb, the father of five children, said he does not worry about getting caught in the crossfire between rebels and government troops. `` I've been driving for 16 years and have n't been fired on yet,'' he said. `` Someone controls the road and someone wants to use the road and it's how you make your deal.'' When the rebels intensified their attacks on the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway in January the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began an airlift to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to overcome severe shortages. The airlift is continuing with as many as 50 military transport planes flying into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> daily with food, fuel, weapons and ammunition. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent military personnel into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1978 to help the Marxist government battle the rebels and for several years had more than 100,000 soldiers in the country. The Soviets agreed to withdraw under an Afghan-Pakistani agreement and Soviet officials said all of their soldiers had left the country by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Man Claims `Bust Lorenzo' Hat Got Him Arrested On Eastern Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 28-year-old button collector says he was kicked off an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet after he put on a `` Bust Lorenzo'' hat, but airport officials say he was arrested for criminal trespass. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was arrested on the misdemeanor charge following the incident Thursday and later released on bond. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Coates </PERSON>, a supervisor with airport operations at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON> was arrested after he refused to sit in his assigned seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> personnel `` asked him to sit in the seat and he did n't want to sit there. ... Then he refused to leave the airplane.'' Eastern officials called the police who arrested Zaubler, <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coates </PERSON> said he did not believe the incident was related to the ongoing strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has been characterized by bitter disputes between union workers and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Zaubler, however, gave a different version of events in an interview Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON> said he had gotten off the jet during a layover in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. At the airport terminal, <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON> saw pickets with `` bust Lorenzo'' buttons and, as a collector of about 50,000 political buttons, he asked for and was given one. Then, he said, he paid a picket $ 5 for a `` bust Lorenzo'' cap. <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON>, a real estate executive, said he wore the button and cap into the Eastern terminal and finally took them off after repeated objections from Eastern personnel. When he got back on the plane, he said someone was sitting in his seat and some passengers had taken his three bags from the overhead compartment and were going through his possessions. He said Eastern ticket agents on the plane refused to help him and ordered him to sit somewhere else, telling him the flight now had open seating so the seat assignment on his boarding pass from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> no longer was valid. `` I put the Lorenzo cap back on for 15 seconds,'' he said. At that point, he said, one of the ticket agents told him: `` That's it. You're off the plane.'' <PERSON> Zaubler </PERSON>, who described himself as a conservative Republican who thinks ill of unions and has `` tremendous respect'' for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, said he apologized but was taken off the plane by police officers and arrested.

 Young survivors of a bus crash that left 24 children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite monument on Mother's Day, the first anniversary of the fiery tragedy. The Rev. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> church owned the bus, prayed for an end to drunken driving and for the passage of laws to `` make it too costly to get into an automobile ... drunk.'' The aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home from a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> amusement park on May 14, 1988, when it was hit by a pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northeast of here. It was the nation's worst alcohol-related highway accident and one of the worst bus crashes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, will be tried in November on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while intoxicated. The monument, raised triangular slabs sloping away from a benchlike centerpiece, stands in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, where many of the victims are buried. It bears the names of the 27 dead and the 40 survivors _ as well as the emblem of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. `` We felt a positive statement must be made,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, owner of the company that built the monument. The idea was for a memorial that would remind viewers of `` the terrible blight of drunken drivers,'' he said at the ceremony. The monument was unveiled by survivors <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Aurentz </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, 14; and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 15; as well as sons of two of the adults who died: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose father drove the bus; and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kytta </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose father was the church's youth minister. The Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Stithton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in this northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city of about 14,000 people, prayed for inner peace for those mourning the victims, but said `` we have every reason to be bitter.'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s top state highway official said the government was trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> renewed his criticism of the state school board's refusal 11 days earlier to require more stringent training of school bus drivers. That was a recommendation of a bus-safety task force appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and chaired by <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. The school board balked because the state did not provide the $ 250,000 the panel estimated would be the cost of the extra training. `` I say that you can not put a price on the safety of our children,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, who did not mention the board by name. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he would `` fight to have another emergency door ... on the left side of all new school buses,'' a move also opposed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The dedication was to be followed by two other ceremonies. Members of a surviving-family support group planned a community appreciation service in the gymnasium of nearby <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which overlooks the cemetery. That was to be followed by a public prayer and memorial service in the football stadium behind the high school.

<HEAD>Teachers Strike Looms With No Last-Minute Reprieve in Sight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teachers cast aside any chances for a last-minute resolution of their lengthy labor dispute with the school district and spent Sunday readying picket signs and rallying the troops. `` We've got our people all across the district making phone calls to their teachers telling them to be ready for the picket line,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said the district would make no last-ditch contract offer. Despite the consensus that a strike was imminent, Ms. <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said she expected teachers to back down and settle before the midnight strike deadline. `` The reality of the offer _ which is one of the best in the nation, quite frankly _ is what makes me optimistic,'' Ms. <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said. `` With the variety of things we see on the table, it is very unusual to have a strike.'' The walkout was set to begin Monday, with hastily hired substitutes crossing picket lines to teach the district's nearly 600,000 students. With five weeks remaining before summer vacation, the strike threatened to create havoc with students' final grades. But teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say in how schools are run. `` We have not received any indication from the school district that they want to come to the bargaining table,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Teachers have been adamant in their demand for a two-year contract with a 21 percent pay hike. They also want elimination of unpaid, non-teaching duties like school yard supervision and after-school meetings, and more influence in how their schools are run, an issue known as teacher governance. The district has offered teachers a 21.5 percent pay raise spread over three years and a teacher governance plan that union leaders have dismissed as tilted in favor of administrators. No formal bargaining talks took place during the weekend. Union and district officials talked informally but were unable to arrange any formal resumption of negotiations, leading to gloomy predictions about any hope of settling the dispute. `` It looks like it's going to happen,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District. `` We have been preparing and planning for this for two months.'' The district conducted mass hirings of substitutes, as teachers marched outside recruiting centers carrying picket signs bearing messages such as `` this is no way to begin a teaching career.'' Hundreds of people responded to the district's call for emergency substitutes, but the number fell far short of replacements needed for the thousands of teachers expected to strike. Ms. <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> warned teachers that their benefits would lapse Monday if they strike, unless they paid $ 270.83 a month from their own pockets. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District, with about 800 schools serving 594,000 students, is second only in size to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and has n't been struck by teachers since a 23-day walkout in 1970. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, has been locked in the contract battle with the district for more than a year. State and local elected officials stayed out of the dispute until last week when <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President Pro Tem <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the district would get at least $ 34 million, and possibly as much as $ 60 million in new revenue that could be used for higher teacher salaries. But district officials refused to raise their offer based solely on projections of funds that might be received. In March, teachers overwhelmingly rejected a 20-percent pay raise over three years, effectively stalling negotiations despite the efforts of a state mediator. Teachers salaries start at $ 23,440 and can go as high as $ 43,319. Administrators' salaries range from $ 37,000 to $ 95,600. District Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>, who has been criticized by union leaders for his perceived hard-line attitude, receives an annual salary of $ 141,000.

<HEAD>Actors Campaign to Save Remains of Elizabethan Theater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shakespearean actors took to a makeshift stage Sunday in a bid to block construction of an office building at the site of a 16th century theater where the Bard himself once performed. The players entertained a rally that attracted hundreds of supporters to the remains of the Rose Theater on the south bank of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. `` It's like the Greeks knocking down the Parthenon to make a car park,'' Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, former director of the National Theater, said at the rally. `` I do not believe any other country at this moment in the world would do this and it's a terrifying example ... of a situation in our country where cash is more important than the soul of the country itself,'' he said. On the makeshift stage a few yards from the Rose, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> read from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>,'' which they now are performing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> is thought to have acted in `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>'' at the Rose. His early plays were staged there. Bulldozers were scheduled to begin work on an office building at the site Monday morning. Construction has been postponed for five months since the remains of the theater were found. Archaeologists pressed ahead with their excavation Sunday, and protesters declared they would conduct an all-night vigil. The effort to save the theater site has attracted the support of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to perform in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>.'' Other dramatic luminaries who have called for preserving the site include actors <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McKellen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dench </PERSON> and playwright <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON>. Environment Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, whose responsibilities include the ancient monuments, said Friday he had not yet decided what to do. The developers have said the work will cause `` minimal damage'' to the remains of the theater. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, `` Everything possible must be done to preserve the theater ... There have been very constructive discussions between the developers, English Heritage -LRB- a body that preserves historical sites -RRB-, and the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with the result that the remains are going to be preserved with the minimum of damage.'' However, <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> of the Museum of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Sunday: `` We do not feel that their idea of preservation is very suitable. A lot of the site will be irreplaceably damaged.''

 Diplomacy must be used if Panamanian leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is to be removed from power, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Sunday. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, adopting a moderate tone a day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, said support from other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders would help the administration's efforts to encourage the general's departure. `` I think whatever you do is going to have to be done diplomatically,'' the former <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressman said at commencement exercises at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would help if the other Latin American nations would come together and make it clear that they wo n't deal with a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government headed by Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will meet next week. If they take a tough, strong position and join in supporting, for example, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, those kinds of things might conceivably, ultimately result in his departure,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his decision to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the wake of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s efforts to nullify the results of an election in which the general's handpicked candidates were defeated. `` I think it was a necessary move, it was a step that a prudent man would take,'' he said. `` We've got some 40,000 Americans who live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, we've got major obligations ... under the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hopefully, the situation will be resolved peaceably. Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should obviously step down and let the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> prevail in terms of the election,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to avoid violence, but added that the country has a commitment to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> under the treaty. `` That commitment runs to the end of the century and the president, as commander-in-chief, has an obligation to carry out the treaty responsibilities and also to safeguard American lives,'' he said. `` I think it is important that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> understand that we are there specifically to see to it that we enforce our rights under the treaty.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who was honored as a `` distinguished alumni'' of the university, also said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will increase defense spending in the future. `` Everybody has this myth in mind that somehow we had this massive arms buildup in the 1980s and it's been growing year by year,'' he said. `` It did grow in the early 1980s, but it's been stable to downhill ever since. If you keep cutting the defense budget, we'll end up sooner or later with less military capability.''

 Young survivors of a bus crash that left 24 children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite monument Sunday, one of three ceremonies marking the first anniversary of the fiery tragedy. `` In some ways, today is worse than others. It's the first anniversary combined with Mother's Day, of all things,'' Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seamands </PERSON> of Asbury Theological Seminary told a televised community memorial service. More than 1,000 people attended the service at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s football stadium, which overlooks the cemetery where many of the victims of the May 14, 1988, accident are buried. About the same number of people attended the first service dedicating the monument at the cemetery, as well as the second ceremony at the high school to thank those who helped victims' families through the past year The aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home when it was hit by a pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrolton </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northeast of here. It was the nation's worst alcohol-related highway accident and one of the worst bus crashes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history The truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, will be tried in November on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while intoxicated. At the football stadium Sunday, the Rev. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> church owned the bus, read the names of the 27 victims `` whose lives were cut short so suddenly by a drunk driver.'' As each name was called, a family member placed a yellow rose on one of 27 wreaths of yellow carnations. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, then placed roses on a larger wreath of yellow roses and white carnations. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> promised to take any action necessary to prevent a recurrence. `` Where stronger penalties are needed, then stronger penalties we will impose,'' he said. <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON> pleaded for all to refrain from drinking and driving. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who attended a Republican fund-raiser the night before in <LOCATION> Woodford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> nearly 70 miles to the east, declined an invitation to attend the service but sent a lengthy telegram, which was read aloud. The telegram called drunken driving `` a national tragedy,'' and said laws against drunken driving must be strictly enforced. The monument dedicated in North Hardin Memorial Gardens consists of raised triangular slabs sloping away from a benchlike centerpiece. It bears the names of the 27 dead and 40 survivors _ as well as the emblem of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. `` We felt a positive statement must be made,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, owner of the company that built the monument. The idea was for a memorial that would remind viewers of `` the terrible blight of drunken drivers,'' he said at the ceremony. The monument was unveiled by survivors <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 16; <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> <PERSON> Aurentz </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, 14; and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 15; as well as sons of two of the adults who died: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose father drove the bus; and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kytta </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose father was the church's youth minister. The Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Stithton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in this northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city of about 14,000 people, prayed for inner peace for those mourning the victims, but said `` we have every reason to be bitter.'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s top state highway official said the government was trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> renewed his criticism of the state school board's refusal 11 days earlier to require more stringent training of school bus drivers. That was a recommendation of a bus-safety task force appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> and chaired by <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. The school board balked because the state did not provide the $ 250,000 the panel estimated would be the cost of the extra training. `` I say that you can not put a price on the safety of our children,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, who did not mention the board by name. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he would `` fight to have another emergency door ... on the left side of all new school buses,'' a move also opposed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>.

 An international team of eight explorers completed a 620-mile trek to the North Pole on Sunday despite poor visibility and drifting ice that hampered their journey, expedition organizers said.

<HEAD>So What's a Model Year Anyway?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The solar calendar is 365 days long, the lunar calendar 354. But only in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> can you have a year 638 days long. Or 371 days, starting the day after Christmas. For a range of reasons, automakers create their own calendars and call them model years. It's May 1989. Look how many advertisements are on the air and in print pushing 1990 model cars now in dealer showrooms? To outsiders, just when a model year starts is anybody's guess. Technically, automakers open their books on a model year on Oct. 1 and close it the following Sept. 30. All during that time, new cars and trucks are rolling off assembly lines and into showrooms. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> recently has tilted toward introducing cars on the day after Christmas. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> started that in 1985 with the Taurus-Sable and did it most recently with new Cougars and Thunderbirds. What about the Chevy that replaces the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> division's Celebrity line? Right now, it's possible for a new-car buyer to pick up an'89 Celebrity or the car that replaces it, a'90 <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON>, at the same dealership on the same day. A few new'88 Celebrities are still around, too. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouldes </PERSON> said marketing was the driving force behind introducing <PERSON> Lumina </PERSON> in April. `` The spring market is the most important market for the calendar year,'' she said. The Lumina should be available for 638 days, figuring that the car will be around on Dec. 31, 1990. Marketing is just one factor in decisions on when to introduce a car. Others involve retooling factories for the new model and working out unforeseen problems. `` All the preplanning in the world ca n't take care of things that need to be done to coincide with a date that was established years before,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>. `` With the growing concern for satisfied customers, it just does n't make sense to put a car in the marketplace if we are not certain it was ready.'' The government pretty much steers clear of model years. Passive restraint regulations _ which call for automatic seat belts and air bags, for instance _ are keyed to date of the vehicle's manufacture, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. `` It does n't matter what the manufacturer calls it,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which governs fuel economy and emissions, the law reads: `` The term ` model year' with reference to any specific calendar year, means a manufacturer's annual production period -LRB- as determined by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator -RRB- which includes Jan. 1 of such calendar year. If a manufacturer has no annual production period, the term ` model year' means the calendar year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the West German automaker, has still another interpretation. It markets <LOCATION> Wolfsburg </LOCATION> Limited Editions cars to test consumer reaction to new colors and options. That annual practice started with a car officially christened a 1983 -LCB-.

<HEAD>High Fructose Corn Syrup Futures Trading A Flop At Grain Exchange</HEAD>

 Even though the trading board for high fructose corn syrup futures at the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has been without a regular pulse for nearly two years, the originator refuses to declare it dead. `` Occasionally there is a seller and occasionally there is a buyer but it seems that never the two can meet,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON>, who led the exchange's effort to become the world's only licensed hub for the trading of high fructose corn syrup futures contracts. After a sweet debut in the spring of 1987, the giant millers and prolific soda pop bottlers who were expected to feed off the market departed with a sour taste. To their dismay they discovered in July of that year that shipping routes for the sugar substitute included stops not authorized by quality control experts at <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottlers, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. Handling the raw material had not been contemplated by many of the traders, but a group of sellers suddenly exercised their right to make deliveries, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. One contract buys 48,000 pounds of the corn syrup, the equivalent of a tank truck. A sudden liquidation of contracts occurred and trading slammed to a halt. The shipping snafu has been corrected, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said, but trading never recovered. Months go by without a trade, leaving players with no assurances that they can buy and sell as they need. `` The fact is obvious that it is n't trading well,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindau </PERSON>, president of the exchange. `` It's safe to say that it has n't made any money for the grain exchange.'' <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> thought he had a natural when he picked high fructose corn syrup as a diversification tool for the commodity exchange. The industry includes big suppliers like A.E. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Midland </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> who are used to futures markets. And there is a booming demand for the product. An estimated 14 billion pounds of the material is consumed every year as an ingredient in soda pop, and baked goods, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. It has a consistency and taste that make it an increasingly attractive substitute for granular sugar, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. More important, its price is low, ranging from eight or nine cents a pound up to 26 cents a pound. <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said he envisioned more than 100 contracts a day changing hands. Bottlers, he thought, would be driven to `` lock in'' the cost of their most expensive ingredient to ensure profitability in long-range marketing plans. For instance, a bottler could buy a contract to set the cost at 17 cents a pound for syrup needed three months later. If the price drops below 17 cents a pound in three months, the bottler still makes a profit on the sale of the pop. If the price increases, the bottler makes an additional gain on the sale of the futures contract. `` The market is there if they want to use it,'' he said. `` Right now they're just living within the traditional constraints of their business. They pay cash for the product. If they guess right, they're lucky.'' The highest volume ever recorded on the exchange was 286 contracts on May 20, 1987, <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. But volume was dismal in the second half of 1987 and 1988 was miserable. <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> could name only a few dates in 1988 when more than 10 contracts traded hands, and activity this year has been nil. `` It's unfortunate but, you know, you do your best and you hope it works,'' <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. `` I guess I ca n't take it personally.'' <PERSON> Lindau </PERSON> said there has been no talk of discontinuing the futures market. Like Rhodie, <LOCATION> Lindau </LOCATION> said another drought or other significant event could jar a response from the industry. `` There is still scattered interest,'' <PERSON> Rhodie </PERSON> said. `` But everybody's still on the sidelines and saying, ` I'll trade it if you trade it.'''

<HEAD>TWA Reports Widening of First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it lost nearly $ 83.1 million during the first quarter, widening the shortfall it suffered a year earlier. The nation's ninth-largest airline said its operating expenses increased in the three months ended March 31, largely because of higher employee costs. The carrier, which was taken private by takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> last year, also said it had $ 16.3 million in charges that primarily resulted from that transaction. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 52.5 million in the first quarter of 1988. The carrier reported revenue of $ 989.7 million in the first quarter, compared with $ 920.2 million a year earlier.
