<HEAD>Parties, Unions Scramble To Boost Turnout</HEAD>

 With two Texans on the national ticket, voter turnout in the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be high. But elsewhere, political parties and other groups are scrambling to get a reluctant electorate out on Election Day. `` I do n't see nearly as much enthusiasm as you typically see in a presidential year,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Verenes </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a comment echoed across the country. With only half of the country's eligible voters expected to turn out Tuesday, down from the 1984 figure of 53 percent, Republicans and Democrats alike know that getting people to vote will be their No. 1 challenge. The White House, 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and all 435 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are at stake, and state and local races and issues abound. Parties, unions and other special-interest groups are running phone banks to reach swing voters as well as the faithful. As usual, workers will hand out leaflets, arrange for baby-sitting and escort people to the polls. But there are also some more unusual strategies. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where the deer-hunting season opened Saturday, Republicans mounted a mail campaign encouraging deer hunters to get an absentee ballot if they wo n't be back from hunting in time for the election. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has saturated <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and a dozen other states with ads claiming <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would disarm sportsmen, a charge the Democratic presidential candidate denies. Coalition'88, a group of gays and others who want two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> AIDS initiatives defeated, will have hundreds of volunteers on Election Day erecting `` human billboards'' at 70 major intersections in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> urging voters to get out and turn down the two propositions. Both parties are conducting massive drives for the state's 13.5 million registered voters but worry about the dampening effect of a ballot with nine state initiatives and possibly hundreds of local measures. Says state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>: `` I'm very concerned that people will be confronted with long lines at the polls, get early results from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and absentee ballots and say, ` What the heck. I wo n't vote.''' Reasons for the low turnout projections vary, but many pundits point to laws requiring registration days or weeks before the election. Many voters also may simply be uninterested in the races and find no compelling issue or inspiring candidate. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, where there is no race for governor, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or a major statehouse post, officials expect many voters to stay home. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> officials blame the tenor of the presidential race. `` There is more negative campaigning than there was four years ago, and I think it might affect the turnout,'' says <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, secretary of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> election board. But in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, home state of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the chief election officer is predicting a record turnout. Registration is up 345,500 from the previous high in 1984, and there is a larger than normal number of statewide races on the ballot to boot. `` If we ca n't get them excited about this election, I do n't know what it's going to take,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON>, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, who conducted the voter registration campaign. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, three tax-limitation initiatives are seen as the biggest hope of getting voters to the polls. And a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> gun-control referendum that's the subject of an expensive <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign could increase voter turnout there by as much as 3 percent, officials suggest. Although the role of getting out the vote traditionally belongs to the parties, unions and other special-interest groups are doing their part. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, opponents of a proposed amendment to the state constitution to make <LOCATION> English </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s official language are conducting a major get-out-the-vote campaign, focused primarily on Hispanic neighborhoods. `` We will make 175,000 calls to Spanish-speaking voters and distribute about 300,000 pieces of literature,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGraw </PERSON>, a political consultant coordinating the effort. `` There are 27 different organizations, some of them very small, working on this statewide.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> will have 500,000 volunteers out on Election Day, a majority of them in states with the most union members which also happen to be states with big electoral votes. The union has a computer information bank that lets volunteers know how to reach 13 million members. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is dispatching buses to meet <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> potash miners getting off work and take them directly to the polls. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union is conducting its own telephone campaign and will have volunteers at key precincts. But even union officials say they are not sure they can get their members to turn out in heavy numbers. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> president in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, predicted a significant dropoff from the 1984 election and summed up the reason for some frustrated voters: `` I do n't believe there's a candidate running for office in this state who's given people a positive reason to go out of their way to vote.''

<HEAD>Rich-Poor Gap Widening, More Families Depend On Women Earners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wealthiest families are keeping ahead of inflation, the poorest are losing ground, and many of the rest are holding even only because more family members are working, according to a new economic study. The study conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> shows a widening gap between rich and poor since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, with the top-earning 20 percent making nine times as much money in 1986 as the poorest 20 percent, compared with seven times as much in 1979. Institute president <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Faux </PERSON> said the report shows average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families have been under greater economic pressure during the past decade than at any time since World War II. `` Without new economic policies it is clear that families can no longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next generations can not expect to live better than their parents,'' <PERSON> Faux </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> economist who wrote the report along with economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fasenfest </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, said the widening gap between rich and poor is a reversal of trends in earlier decades. The study concludes that without big increases in the number of women working, as many as 60 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families _ those earning less than $ 40,000 a year in 1986 _ would have been unable to keep up with inflation between 1979 and 1986, the latest year for which complete data is available. The report says the number of working wives increased from 55.4 percent in 1979 to 66.1 percent in 1986. `` This is an important first step in measuring the real economic benefit of having a wife work,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Sunday. But he cautioned that more study is needed to determine the additional costs families incur when the wife works, such as greater need for child care. The institute, formed in 1986, is a non-partisan, non-profit organization which has often been critical of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative economic policies. It said that with more women in the work force, average adjusted family income increased 7.3 percent from $ 38,492 in 1979 to $ 41,288 in 1986. The study multiplies 1979 earnings by 1.609 to adjust for inflation. But it showed that income for the lower two-fifths of the nation, or those earning under $ 27,000, is slipping behind inflation. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said the study used a standard economic practice of dividing the country into fifths by income. The top group includes families that earned over $ 59,533 in 1986. Their income averaged $ 94,104, compared with $ 9,133 for families in the lowest fifth. The report said salaries for most working wives have increased faster than inflation, while salaries for all but the richest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men have n't kept up. Wives' earnings, adjusted for inflation, increased 12.1 percent from an average $ 14,064 in 1979 to $ 15,768 in 1986, the study said, while husbands' adjusted earnings dropped from $ 23,204 to $ 22,240. It also said young adults who do not finish college are doing `` substantially worse'' than those who were the same age a decade ago. Low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached young people _ 1.5 million more than a decade ago _ to `` return to the nest'' of their parents' households rather than living on their own, it said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the forcibly retired commander of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most feared army unit who was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges, died Sunday under suspicious circumstances, a family friend said. He was 49. Radio Haiti-Inter said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a 29-year army veteran and one of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most powerful figures, died of a heart attack at about 3 p.m. in his home in suburban Fermathe. The independent station gave no other details. A family friend said there was speculation <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was poisoned, possibly prior to having a heart attack. The friend, who would not be identified further, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s housemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to <LOCATION> Petionville </LOCATION> police station for questioning about the colonel's death <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s former wife, <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON> <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>, was taken to the station Sunday night and was under police protection because of fear of reprisals by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s relatives, the friend said. The military government's spokesman, <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, said he had no information on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s death. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> also said she had nothing. The capital, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, appeared calm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was fired Sept. 30 after a coup led by noncommissioned officers ousted <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, replacing him with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. The coup leaders said they were outraged with the state-sponsored murder and corruption <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> tolerated. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had commanded the 700-man <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, the most brutal unit in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 7,000-member army, and had been linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, the hated private army of the 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship. Soldiers under <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s command have been blamed for widespread violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised after a popular uprising drove <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> into exile in February 1986. The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the cancellation of independently run general elections last November, leaving at least 34 people dead. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had been considered one of the most powerful members of the army, which has run this impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation for most of its 144 years. In March, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Soldiers who staged the Sept. 17 rebellion that ousted <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> said they wanted to name <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> the army chief but decided not to because of the drug charges. Immediately after the coup, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> appeared to be allied with <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, but the new leader reportedly became concerned that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> might turn against him. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> had already ousted about 60 of the army's most repressive commanders. Haitian and diplomatic sources later said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s retirement could help lead to the renewal of a $ 70 million annual aid package the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off after the November 1987 election massacre. One of the conditions the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has set for renewing aid is that <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug trafficking indictment alleges <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> conspired to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1986. It says the traffickers used a landing strip on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s farm 90 miles outside <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> to load and fly the shipment to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON>, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who later defected, told Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. in a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that 70 percent of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s troops were involved in drug <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a military junta that assumed power when <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An attempt to dismiss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in June failed and led to the fall of the civilian government of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who won military-run presidential elections in January. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> had reassigned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to an administrative post, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> refused and was backed by <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> on June 20, accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> remained head of his battalion. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did not intervene when soldiers overthrew <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in September. The soldiers who formed <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s new government have said they want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for elections.

 Typhoon Skip headed toward the central <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Sunday packing winds of 102 mph in the wake of a tropical depression and two weeks after another typhoon killed hundreds of people. The government weather service issued storm warnings Sunday for the eastern <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> islands and northeastern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>.

 Gunmen who staged a failed coup in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> and were holding 25 hostages aboard a crippled boat surrended on the high seas to <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> navy ships Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency quoting an official statement issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said the foreign mercenaries surrended at 9.30 a.m -LRB- 11 p.m. EST -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> between the <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> capital Male and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> report. Two Indian warships had been tailing the boat and military officers negotiated by radio with the gunmen for release of the hostages, Indian and <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> officials in Male said Saturday. Among the captives was a Maldivian Cabinet minister, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday night that the captain of the crippled vessel said the mercenaries fatally shot two hostages, wired the ship with explosives and threatened to blow it up if attacked. The report said a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent had spoken to the captain in a ship-to-shore call. Maj. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> security forces said he could not verify the report. He was contacted by telephone in Male by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and said the captain's statement `` may have been propaganda.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> report identified the ship as the Progress Light. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ships </ORGANIZATION> lists the Progress Light as a 5,180-ton freighter owned by <ORGANIZATION> Maldives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in Male Maldivian President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> said in a telephone interview broadcast by the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the safety of the hostages was the paramount concern. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> said Saturday from Male, `` We would n't want to do anything that would engander their lives.'' Officials said an aide to former President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> participated in Thursday's pre-dawn attack and may have instigated it. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, denied involvement. In Male, members of the security forces patrolled the gray sand streets on Saturday. Businesses and shops were closed because of a national day of mourning for those who died in the violence. Bloodstains were visible near the bullet-scarred presidential palace and security force headquarters. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <PERSON> Male </PERSON> said 27 to 32 people were killed when 150 gunmen _ believed to be Tamil mercenaries from nearby <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> _ attempted to overthrow President <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>. `` This figure is probably understated, because the mercenaries may have removed their dead,'' Ambassador A.K. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said. He provided no breakdown on the deaths, but said 25 people were taken hostage aboard the vessel. Earlier reports had said there were 18 to 20 hostages. The mercenaries fled early Friday after Indian paratroopers landed to help <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> and his lightly armed security forces in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nation, which is also known as the <LOCATION> Maldive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Fathulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said they suspected the coup was instigated by <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> aide. `` He was brandishing a gun as if he was the leader,'' <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said when contacted by telephone from <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. `` He gave orders to different groups of people, and for a short time this character went into the president's office and to satisfy himself, he sat on the president's desk just to assert he had taken over the country.'' <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> and two <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> businessmen accompanied the gunmen. He said said none of the three was caught and may be on the boat with the gunmen. He said the cargo ship, hit by fire from <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> troops Friday, was limping northeast at 9 mph toward <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> with the Indian warships staying close at hand. He said the hostages included Transport Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujithaba </PERSON>. Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> supporters have been trying for up to five years to recruit guerrillas from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil ethnic minority. Tamil militants have been waging a separatist war against the Sri Lankan government since 1983. The diplomats said <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>'s supporters were thought to be behind coup attempts in 1980 and 1983. <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>, 50, was first elected president in 1978 after <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> resigned. Indian paratroopers captured four gunmen Friday. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said said other gunmen escaped in two boats, including the one with the hostages. Indian paratroopers were conducting an island-by-island search for the other boat, <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON> said some Indian troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, and reporters saw no Indian soldiers in Male on Saturday.

 A strong earthquake hit remote areas of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> provinces in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, seismology officials said Sunday.

 Sri Lankan mercenaries who fled with 27 hostages in a ship after an attempted coup in the <ORGANIZATION> Maldives </ORGANIZATION> surrendered Sunday when an Indian navy frigate fired on the vessel, an Indian naval commander said. The commander said all the hostages were safe. He said the Indian warship Godarvari fired on the mercenaries' ship, hitting it below the waterline `` It was a controlled, minimum action to stop the boat from moving and increase psychological pressure. There were no casualties,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials said Maldivian Transport Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujithaba </PERSON> was among the captives aboard the M.V. Progress Light, a Maldivian freighter. The gunmen fled in the 5,100-ton vessel Friday after about 150 mercenaries tried the day before to topple President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>, who asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to send hundreds of troops to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island chain to help rout the attackers. The Indian naval commander said the mercenaries on the ship surrendered at 9:30 a.m. 11 p.m. EST about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> are about 500 miles southwest of both <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, an island nation 100 miles off the Indian coast. `` The hostages, numbering 27, have been flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION>,'' the south Indian airport used as a staging base for the Indian military operation that foiled the attempted coup. Earlier reports said 25 hostages were aboard the Progress Light, but the naval commander said he was including the cargo vessel's Indian captain as a captive He did not account for the other discrepancy. `` The mercenaries are to be brought to Male by ship,'' the commander said. The vessel was listing badly, moving slowly and was not expected to draw near <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s capital city of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> before 5 p.m., said <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> port authorities speaking on condition of anonymity. At a news conference in the capital Male on Sunday, <PERSON> Fathulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON>, foreign minister of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, gave an official death toll of 14 in the attempted coup: eight <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> security men, three civilians and three mercenaries. He said 40 people were injured and four mercenaries were captured. He said no mercenaries were left in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, a 475-mile chain of 2,000 coral atolls and tiny islets. He said all mercenaries fled by boat or were captured or killed. Casualty figures have fluctuated widely since the coup began. On Saturday, the Indian high commissioner -LRB- ambassador -RRB- in Male, <PERSON> A.K </PERSON> <PERSON> Banerjee </PERSON>, put the toll at 27 to 32. <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said the mercenaries were Sri Lankan Tamils, echoing statements made earlier by several officials in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tamil militants are fighting a separatist war against the Sinhalese-dominated government in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. He blamed the coup attempt on on ex-President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> and a former <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, has denied involvement. A senior security officer in Male discounted an earlier report that two of the hostages were killed. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reported late Saturday night that the captain of the Progress Light said the mercenaries fatally shot two hostages and threw their bodies overboard. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said its correspondent had spoken to the captain by ship-to-shore radio. But Maj. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maldives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the captain told him at 4:30 a.m. Sunday that no hostages had been killed. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> quoted Capt. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayadevan </PERSON> as saying the hostages had been treated well. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>, who gave only one name, said he spoke to <PERSON> Jayadevan </PERSON> by radio and believed the Indian captain had been pressured by the mercenaries to tell the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> two hostages were killed.

<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> vomited blood Sunday and discharged a substantial amount of blood twice from his bowels, palace officials said. Doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor several emergency transfusions totaling 3.4 pints, the officials said. The frail monarch's pulse rate rose to 118 per minute early in the evening, <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. The rate is about the same as that of a normal person while running. His systolic blood pressure, which has been about 150 in recent days, dropped to 122, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> discharged a considerable amount of blood in the morning, then a large amount late in the afternoon. At the same time as the later discharge, the frail emperor also vomited a small amount of blood, he said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has discharged blood from his bowels intermittently since he became seriously ill Sept. 19. Palace officials have described three past discharges as `` considerable,'' and one last Sunday as `` large.'' Doctors believe the blood is coming from a hemorrhage in the area of the emperor's upper intestine. Sunday's transfusions brought the total amount of blood the emperor has received since Sept. 19 to 38.9 pints, close to four times the normal amount in his body. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was awake and had talked to attendants in his room in the Fukiage Palace. In recent days the emperor has spent much of the time sleeping, according to palace sources. After a brief visit Saturday, his daughter described him as fatigued. The emperor's temperature declined again Sunday, following a decision by his doctors Friday to resume the use of antibiotics to control a worsening infection around his bile duct. The doctors had stopped the powerful drugs two weeks ago because of concerns about possible side effects. Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Snow Studied for Effects of Summer Fires on Animals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A scientist is studying the effects of last summer's fire in Yellowstone National Park by analyzing urine-soaked snow to determine whether animals are getting enough to eat. Biologist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> perfected the testing, which experts think has great promise for aiding wildlife studies around the world. `` <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s technique is generating a great deal of excitement among researchers,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mech </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scientist who is an internationally known wolf expert. `` It can be applied anywhere animals live in snow for part of the year.'' Mech and <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON>, a biochemist widely recognized for his research on endangered wildlife, initiated the technique of using snow-urine samples in wildlife research. But several years ago, they turned over perfection of the technique to <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON>, then a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. For the past two years, <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> has studied <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s elk and bison under an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, for whom he works, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the 2.2 million-acre park in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON>'s work will allow scientists to compare the health of the bison and elk before and after the summer fires, which affected 500,000 to 880,000 acres in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. There are no findings yet from the study. About 20,000 elk and 2,600 bison spend the winter in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates that four bison and 250 elk died in the fires, which simply forced most big mammals into different parts of the park to find forage. <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> was among about 25 scientists who recently met at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> to prepare a plan for studying the effects of the fires. He stressed that, while the fires charred extensive timber and brush, the burned-over areas form a mosaic pattern, rather than a contiguous tract. That's important, <PERSON> DelGiudice </PERSON> said, because while vegetation has not yet returned to areas burned in late summer, young plants already have emerged in tracts that were charred earlier. Those plants should help bison and elk survive this winter.

<HEAD>Democrats Gun for Bigger Senate Advantage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is an unusual unanimity this year about prospects for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in Tuesday's balloting: Democrats will remain in control, and may well increase their eight-seat advantage. `` The Democrats will hold onto 54 seats at a minimum, and I believe have a very good opportunity to add,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We realize it's still quite volatile out there,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We could end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as easily be plus two or better.'' One reason little change is expected is that, unlike some past presidential elections, there has been no overriding national theme dictated by the top of the ticket, the kind of compelling issue that would propel voters to seek massive changes. Rather, polls have show a general contentment with the status quo, and that works to the benefit of incumbents. That advantage extends to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where very little movement is expected in the Democrats' 255-177 majority. `` There is n't the thematic difference'' that has pervaded presidential contests in the past, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it best: We are the change. It's not as clear a mandate as in 1980, when there was such a screaming need for change.'' That was the year Republicans rode <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails to a 12-seat pickup and control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first time in a quarter-century. In 1986, an eight-seat gain enabled Democrats to retake control. This time, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues, devoted mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each other's records. So issues in this year's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign have been largely drawn from a list of topics that Democrats claim as their own, although they have been used by candidates of both parties: the environment, education, Social Security, health care and `` family issues'' like child care. Also prominent in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> stump speeches and advertising have been the problems of drugs and crime, which register near the top of Americans' concerns in national polls. Most <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> incumbents of both parties appeared likely to win re-election on Tuesday, but there were several prominent exceptions. Analysts said Republican Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who was appointed in 1987 to fill an unexpired <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term, was the most likely to be ousted. Democratic former Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, a popular figure with a Hollywood-like appeal in the state, held a heavy lead in polls. Three other incumbents _ two Republicans and one Democrat _ also faced difficult battles for survival. In <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, GOP Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, who for months had been considered the most vulnerable Republican incumbent, has fought back to a dead heat with his challenger, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. A political action committee of import car dealers was pouring $ 382,000 into mass mailings and TV spots for <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> was running ads linking himself to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, the veteran maverick Republican from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, has resorted to his own negative ads attacking challenger <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, the state's Democratic attorney general. The race is the most complex political matchup in the country. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> has sought to outflank <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> by portraying him as aloof from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> concerns, and has attracted support from all parts of the political spectrum. Republicans hungry for an upset were pointing to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where they claimed to have <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> on the run. His GOP rival, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, was running positive biographical ads in the closing days of the campaign, while <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON> was airing man-in-the-street testimonials advising against sending `` a greenhorn'' to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Six open seats, where no incumbent was seeking re-election, were the other major battleground. Democratic former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> appeared poised to claim a formerly Republican seat, and Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Vt </LOCATION>., was likely to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from his state Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., also seemed to be holding firmly to a polling lead in his bid to replace retiring Democratic Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> But in three other open seats, the outcome was up for grabs. Former Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, a Republican, picked up a spate of last-minute newspaper endorsements in his bid to keep <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hands, but polls showed Democratic rival Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> in a dead heat <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> promised a similar cliffhanger, with Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> seeking to beat out Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> in a state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a heavy advantage. Like <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was receiving substantial last-minute backing from the import car dealers PAC.

Republican state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> was pressing hard, and both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned for her in the state.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relishes talking about how he and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> solved the `` malaise'' of the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> years, when inflation was in double digits and the prime interest rate soared past 20 percent. `` Now, with low inflation and low interest rates, housing is again within reach of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s families,'' boasts <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee. `` Sound Republican policies have helped more families than ever to realize the dream of home ownership.'' Interest rates did come down, but housing prices rose rapidly and a smaller percentage of Americans live in their own homes today than when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration started: 63.7 percent compared with 65.6 percent in 1980. Tenants in many cities are confronted with soaring rents and a dwindling supply of apartments. Homelessness has become a major social ill, with estimates of the number of people living on the streets or in shelters ranging from 250,000 to 3 million. It adds up to a crisis in housing for millions of Americans that poses a major challenge for the next president. The vice president's Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has sought to make housing one of the major campaign issues to support his claim that `` I'm on your side.'' Despite his upbeat talk, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has acknowledged the problems and offered the outlines of the strategy he would employ to solve them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised that one of his chief goals `` will be to see that all American families are able to obtain decent, affordable housing. ... To do this, we will maintain the policies that have brought us low inflation, low interest rates and strong job creation, which have given many Americans the income to buy homes.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to allow first-time home buyers to withdraw up to $ 10,000 in tax-free savings from their Individual Retirement Accounts or 401-K accounts to apply toward their downpayments. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Levittown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the post-World War II model community, to unveil his plan called Home START -LRB- Saving Toward An Affordable Residence Today -RRB-. It would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> $ 400 million in lost revenues. Both candidates propose relaxing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan rules for first-time buyers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> to experiment with reduced downpayments, possibly as low as $ 1,000. He also wants the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> to allow higher loan limits in expensive housing areas. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Home START would allow people to get <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortagages with only 3 percent down. The agency now requires 3 percent down for the first $ 25,000 and 5 percent for the remainder of the purchase price. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also would remove the current ceiling on <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loan guarantees of $ 67,000 nationally and up to $ 101,250 in high cost areas, and would expand <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> financing of adjustable rate mortgages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, criticized by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> during the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primaries for saying most of the homeless were mentally ill, now acknowledges that `` too many are families with children.'' He promises to form public-private partnerships to build more single-room occupancy shelters, and he backs the $ 280 million McKinney Act to aid the homeless. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is an enthusiastic supporter of housing vouchers for the poor and allowing tenants to take over ownership of public housing. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> support the home mortgage interest deduction. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> notes that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built its 100 millionth home last year, and that housing starts were 25 percent higher in 1987 than in 1980. Builders have constructed 10 million homes in the past six years. But with the median price of new homes up to $ 112,400 in the second quarter of 1988, many young families find it increasingly difficult to climb onto the first rung of the housing ladder. `` Since this administration took office, the price of houses has raced ahead of people's wages and has made it impossible for many people to buy the homes they grew up in,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut deeply into the budget for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which has fallen from $ 34 billion to $ 15 billion. The government, which used to help build or rehabilitate 200,000 units of housing for low and moderate income families each year, now backs just 25,000. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises to launch a National Partnership for Affordable Housing to spur construction of low and moderate income housing with federal grants and other support. A report last March by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> warned, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is increasingly becoming a nation of housing haves and have-nots.'' `` Young households find purchasing a first home especially difficult. ... Unable to secure a home of their own, these persons remain renters and bid up the price of rental housing,'' the center said. `` The problem of first-time home buyers has gotten worse during the -LRB- past -RRB- eight years,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for government affairs. For people who already owned homes, `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years were very good.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the homeownership rate among households in the 24-29 age group fell from 43.3 percent in 1980 to 35.9 percent in 1987, while the rate fell from 61.1 to 53.2 percent for those in the 30-34 age group. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> says the 1986 overhaul of the nation's tax code stripped away many incentives to build apartments. Builders are starting only 385,000 multifamily units this year, down from 669,000 in 1985. `` The rent burden has become particularly onerous for young, single-parent families whose rents have increased from 34.9 percent of their incomes in 1974 to 58.4 percent in 1987,'' a report by the home builders says.

<HEAD>Video Warns Students That Unwed Parents Must Pay Child Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY EYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YAZOO CITY, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Long after they've paid for their stereo or first car, some <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> teen-agers could be making monthly payments they never anticipated _ child support. Faced with the highest percentage of teen-age pregnancies in the nation, the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants youths to know they can be held financially responsible for illegitimate offspring. A new educational program, which will include a video presentation and a brochure, explains that if an unwed mother accepts welfare benefits, she must help locate her child's father. Once a court has ordered child support payments, the state can collect them to offset welfare costs. If the mother refuses, her portion of the family's welfare benefits will be cut. The program, geared for junior and senior high school students, is being explained personally by state Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> to school boards around the state. The schools can decide how to use the program. It points out the state's right to require men to submit to blood tests to legally establish paternity. `` We owe it to the taxpayers to have the young men begin to take responsibility as well,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said last week as he explained the program to school officials. Of all babies born in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> during 1987, 20 percent, or 8,302, were born to teen-age mothers, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, director of reproductive health for the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Too many of those children end up on welfare rolls, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` We want to take a message out to young men as well as young women that there's a hard economic consequence to an unwed pregnancy,'' he said. `` That economic consequence is that if you participate in having someone become pregnant, then you're going to pay that child support payment until that child is 21 years of age.'' `` When we begin to diagram that out for students and show them what that means, they'll say back to us things like, ` Gee, I've got this part-time job and I need the money for paying for my stereo or I need the money for gasoline,' and we basically will be saying, ` Tough luck, that money first has to go for child-support payments,''' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. The welfare department has sought bids for the teen-age parenthood video, which should be ready for distribution to classrooms in January, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. The program also has a dollars-and-cents guide that extends into the students' adult lives, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. Students will be given a chart listing how much they can expect to earn in several occupations ranging from a minimum-wage job to corporate executive. The chart also tells them how much they could expect to pay in child support. For example, if a student someday becomes a janitor and makes $ 700 per month, then he can be required to pay $ 119 monthly, or $ 29,988 covering his child through age 21. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> explained that the state can enforce child support collections by requiring an employer to withhold a portion of the parent's pay check, by intercepting state and federal tax refund checks, and by putting liens on real estate and personal property. Information regarding past-due child support will be distributed to credit reporting agencies for determining the parent's credit rating, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Yazoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school board member <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said he thought the new educational program could prevent some teen-age pregnancies. `` I think it would wake me up pretty quick,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said the educational program is similar to those offered by welfare departments in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He said the plan also was presented recently to the state's judges association, since the courts are responsible for setting child support payments Chancery Judge <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rankin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has volunteered to speak to students. `` I enforce it just like I do in a divorce case,'' the judge said of child support involving unwed parents. `` I would assume that all judges take the same position that I do. It's the law.''

<HEAD>Virus Killed Thousands of Seals, Researcher Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A contagious virus that causes a respiratory infection and high fever was to blame for the deaths of thousands of seals in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> during the summer, a researcher said Sunday. <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> <PERSON> Markussen </PERSON>, a biologist appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Norwegian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to study the seal deaths, said the epidemic appears to be over in Norwegian, <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> and Swedish waters but that some cases of seal death are still registered by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> <PERSON> Markussen </PERSON> was quoted by the national <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying: `` Autopsies and analyses carried out at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> give no factual evidence that the illness symptoms causing the seal deaths have anything to do with pollution or distemper. A contagious virus appears to cause the symptoms and subsequent infection of the respiratory passage with coughing and fever up to 41 degrees Celsius -LRB- 102 F -RRB-.'' Researchers estimate that nearly 12,000 seals along the coasts of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> countries died during the summer because of the illness.

 <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is becoming one of the most inhospitable and risky areas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and military personnel. Nagging concerns over personal security, widespread anti-American sentiment and the career risk of having to defend highly controversial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies plague <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials assigned in the region, particularly in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. As an example of the potential risk to career advancement, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., an outspoken critic of administration policy in the region, recently blocked the promotion of two foreign service officers stationed there A country-by-country rundown of the difficulties facing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel: <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ In October, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> sentries at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> exchanged gunfire on four occasions with unidentified intruders. Between February and October, there were 240 reported cases of harassment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. In September, the administration decided to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic presence because of what one official called a `` potentially confrontational situation'' linked to continued U.S.-Panamanian hostility. The administration's decision not to have dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military-dominated government has produced a variety of problems for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats Some are forced to drive with expired licenses because the government wo n't renew them, while others rent cars rather than risk driving with expired plates. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> _ Concern over personal security has heightened with stepped up leftist rebel activity in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. In late October, the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> were struck by a projectile that cracked several windows and caused minor damage. In previous years, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has been the target of rebel attacks on several occasions but without serious incident. Diplomats posted in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> long have been security conscious, never taking the same route twice in a row when commuting. To avoid detection, one diplomat had his car repainted every few weeks. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ In July, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other members of the embassy staff were expelled by the Sandinista government on grounds of interfering in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has refused to allow the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to send replacement envoys to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, placing an unusually heavy work load on the remaining skeleton staff. Their mission is complicated by an atmosphere of almost complete mistrust between the two governments. Several <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the biggest concern of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats posted in the region is not personal security but the possibility that their association with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies could damage their careers. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> recently blocked the promotions of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON>, who is stationed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and spent a brief period as head of the embassy. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> complained that the two envoys impeded congressional attempts to exercise oversight of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. His action underscored the continuing animosity between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> liberals over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dlouhy </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of `` McCarthyite tactics that would send a chilling message to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.'' Said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankle </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the union of career diplomats: `` As a career officer you do put your career on the line in these highly charged situations. There are a lot of dangers involved.'' Despite the risks, there is no shortage of career diplomats willing to serve in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say. One reason is that service in that region is a quick route to `` in-house'' promotions, the officials say, noting that congressional approval is required only for promotions involving the highest ranking officials. Still, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been a career-threatening area for some time. When the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration assumed office eight years ago, numerous officials who had a hand in implementing President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were either fired or sent to low-priority areas as punishment for perceived misjudgments. The most dramatic example was <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s last assistant secretary for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowdler </PERSON>, who shortly before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first inaugural was summarily evicted from his office Shattered by the experience, he soon left the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and has lived in virtual seclusion with his wife in southern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> ever since.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Solicits Help In Curbing Loan Defaults</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is seeking the advice of thousands of lenders, colleges and universities, and public officials on how to hold down the escalating default rate on student loans. The Education Department says taxpayers spent $ 1.5 billion to cover defaults on the guaranteed student loan program in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, almost 43 percent of the program's entire cost. The figure represents a 200 percent increase over the past five years in what is now known as the <LOCATION> Stafford </LOCATION> loan program, the department said. `` We want the advice of all parties _ the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the public, schools, lenders, guarantee agencies and borrowers,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said in a statement. `` A lot has already been done, but clearly, additional action is necessary.'' The program has loaned about $ 40 billion since it began. Of the current $ 12 billion in outstanding loans, about $ 5 billion is overdue, the department said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, acting deputy undersecretary for planning, budget and evaluation, said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has sent letters appealing for advice to more than 7,000 participating colleges and universities, 13,000 lenders, 54 agencies that guarantee student loans, 50 governors, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who was president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> until taking over as education secretary in September, is also accepting suggestions from students. He is especially concerned about those who defaulted on their loans because they were unable to earn a living after attending unscrupulous trade or other schools that award a certificate but do not provide necessary job skills. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said some schools have 100 percent default rates, suggesting they may not be providing the kind of education necessary for students to hold a job and earn enough money to repay their loans. `` There are a lot of scams going on here,'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said. A school must be accredited to qualify students for guaranteed student loans, but <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said there are still `` fly by night operations'' that `` do n't give students a technical background _ just a paper certificate, no skills, and a debt. `` It's getting just unbelievable. Schools are recruiting right out of welfare lines. They get the students to get federally backed loans and the school gets the money and the kid gets the debt,'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had proposed that schools that fail to get their default rate below 20 percent could be cut from the program. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has extended the comment period on that proposal until the end of February. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said of the 7,300 schools participating in the program, 30 percent have default rates above 20 percent. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> also wants to know to what extent lenders, guarantee agencies and schools should share in the risk and cost of defaults; how communication can be improved among those participating; whether credit reports and co-signers should be required for borrowers with poor credit histories; and how consumer and personal financial counseling can be used most effectively.

 In a bitter shouting match with journalists, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> described the foreign media as `` thieves and enemies'' who know `` absolutely nothing'' about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> held the exchange with journalists during a hostile question-and-answer period that followed his speech at a Saturday night dinner banquet put on by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Among other issues, questions touched on the closing of an anti-apartheid newspaper and on detentions of anti-apartheid activists. `` I am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work instead of all the beauty, promise and goodwill,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said after an argumentative exchange with one journalist. `` You do n't understand <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. You do n't understand African aspirations. You do n't understand African history,'' he said. The 400 people attending included foreign and local journalists and their guests, such as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. `` I accuse you of being superficial. I accuse you of glibly gliding over the African realities of which you know nothing, absolutely nothing,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told the audience. After a prolonged exchange with one women, he said: `` I do n't want to quarrel with beautiful ladies I do better things with them.'' He wondered out loud whether one questioner had `` psychological problems.'' `` Will you just sit down and listen to a man who has traveled through <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told another persistent questioner. `` Blacks do n't want a Westminster-style democracy,'' he said. `` Even if you could remove all the whites from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tomorrow ... what you put here will not work.'' Asked about last week's government suspension of the anti-apartheid Weekly Mail newspaper, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he supported the move. He described the newspaper as one of the most `` vicious'' he has seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to `` more violence in this country.'' Asked why members of an extreme right-wing white group are not detained as frequently as anti-apartheid activists, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said: `` Do n't be stupid. It's not a question of arresting a few people and that's the end of it.'' `` There are whites in this country who can put together a more efficient violent organization than the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government and its system of apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs. At the end of the hour-long impromptu debate, the host offered to thank <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but the foreign minister refused to accept. Instead he returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>, a 19th century South African politician. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Kruger </PERSON>'s -RRB- opening words were, ` friends, citizens, thieves and enemies.' And that is how I look at you this evening,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. The audience responded with boos, hisses and shouts of `` go home!'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> left shortly afterward, before dessert was served. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s media restrictions have been further tightened under the 29-month-old state of emergency. The emergency regulations prohibit reporting on security force actions, most forms of protest and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement has not been comprehensive.

 An amateur diver found more than 20 crates of ammunition in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gela </LOCATION> near the beach where allied troops invaded <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> in 1943, a news agency said Sunday.

The navy will recover the other crates, which may include weapons, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. Police believe the munitions were lost during the allied invasion in July 1943, but they have not ruled out the possibility the shipment was the result of illegal arms traffic along the southern Sicilian coast, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> do n't advocate a shortened school week. But they probably never consulted fifth-grader <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbs </PERSON> when they wrote their education platforms. `` I would make my school meet every other day,'' wrote <PERSON> Erica </PERSON>, who also would push for longer recess and no classes in May if she were elected president. <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> is too young to be on the ballot Tuesday, but she's old enough to imagine how the country would be run if she were in the Oval Office. Child's Play, a theater troupe, brought those dreams to the stage Saturday when it presented `` Kids for President,'' a 45-minute production based on the writings of 400 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> elementary school students. If elected president, the youngsters said they would rig Lotto games so their friends would get rich; turn the White House into a toy factory and order congressmen to build toys; hire an expert chef to prepare school lunches; elect <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION> star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> mayor of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and end federal `` spending on dumb things.'' `` Kids want to be listened to, to be talked to,'' said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Podagrosi </PERSON>, executive director of Child's Play and one of six people who acted on stage. `` Their naivete is wonderful. They have creative solutions, pure solutions. `` But these kids also know what's going on,'' she said. `` There is a great social awareness about war, the homeless, drugs and AIDS.'' Fifth-grader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said he would send the homeless to the roomy mansions owned by pop stars <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The theater troupe and the Children's Bookstore collected 400 writing samples from students around <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The 40 best entries _ serious and silly _ were performed. The authors were invited downtown to the Goodman Studio Theatre for the free show. After the show, the actors summoned the students to the stage for a `` creativity certificate.'' Since they wo n't be president in 1988, what would the youngsters tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if they met them? `` That's easy,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Norfleet </PERSON>, 9. `` I think they should n't make promises they ca n't keep.''

 Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the shop of a boat dealer suspected of links with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas Sunday, demolishing the business and wounding five people, two of them seriously, police said. The Israeli army said its warplanes destroyed a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla base in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It did not mention casualties. Lebanese police said four Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships blasted the shop and a nearby citrus grove with eight rockets in two sorties. The shop in the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> was closed at the time. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the shop owner, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON>, was suspected of renting two motorboats to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and selling the guerrillas spare parts. It was the sixth Israeli air strike against guerrilla targets in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in three weeks and the 21st this year. By police count, 108 people were killed and 204 wounded in raids since Jan. 3. <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON>'s motorboats, anchored off the beach about 600 yards from his shop, were not hit in the raid, police said. Earlier police reports said aircraft attacked guerrilla bases in the teeming <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh refugee camp on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts. Police said the guerrillas in the camp opened up with anti-aircraft fire but were not targeted by the Israeli aircraft. Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen also killed three guerrillas who apparently landed in a boat on the <LOCATION> Meditteranean </LOCATION> coast just north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army command said. An Israeli army announcement said the base attacked Sunday was used for launching attacks and ammunition storage. It said all planes that took part in the raid returned safely. The brief announcement gave no further details. The attack followed mock raids by six Israeli jets against the Palestinian guerrilla strongholds at midmorning. Palestinian camps south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> have taken the brunt of the stepped-up Israeli raids, which have by police count have killed 40 people and wounded 91 in the past three weeks. The blitz is in apparent retaliation for a suicide car-bombing that killed eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Oct. 19 and a firebomb attack that killed an Israeli mother and her three children in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Oct. 30. Also Sunday, Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen killed three guerrillas in a firefight near <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, about two miles north of the border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were no <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> casualties, the military command said. The army said the guerrillas apparently landed from a boat and were hiding in the area. One of the guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the patrol before being killed, it said. Two other guerrillas were found shortly afterward and were killed in a firefight, the army said. It did not identify the group to which the guerrillas belonged. The clash was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a six - to 10-mile zone carved out when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew the bulk of its occupation troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985 The zone is patrolled by about 2,000 Lebanese militiamen trained and financed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israeli soldiers also are stationed in the zone. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, accused the Amal militia of violating a Syrian-sponsored no-kidnapping pact. The accord was signed Friday by the two sides, the country's main Shiite militias. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement charged that Amal militiamen had kidnapped four <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> district Saturday night. There was no comment from Amal. Amal, Arabic for hope, and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> have been locked in a bloody struggle for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiite Moslems, the nation's largest single sect.

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leaders on Sunday threatened broad protests, including strikes, if the government does not reverse its decision to close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. The statement was the strongest yet by the banned trade union movement on the planned closing of the yard, where Solidarity began. Solidarity, which in August helped end <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of strikes in seven years, now appears to be on a collision course with the communist government. The government announced Oct. 31 that it will close the yard in December because the business is losing money. But Solidarity's national executive commission, led by <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said in a statement, `` There is no actual economic justification of this decision.'' `` The <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard has to be defended,'' Solidarity said. `` In this situation we consider it necessary to conduct a broad action in November for the legalization of Solidarity, in defense of the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard and the repressed participants in strikes _ even resorting to strike action.'' Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said the union's plans might be clearer after a workers' rally scheduled Tuesday in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. A <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, quoted <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as telling worshipers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> that he would call the a national `` strike alert'' at the rally. A `` strike alert'' would mean organizing strike committees and getting workers prepared to strike at any moment unless their demands are met, said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Maziarski </PERSON>. The Solidarity statement said the decision to close the 10,000-worker yard is a `` dangerous political act, pointing out the fact that the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> takes advantage of extraordinary powers to sustain Stalinist methods of administering the economy.'' It is `` an act of revenge against Solidarity and the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard,'' the statement said. While acknowledging that economic reform, which Solidarity supports, may force the closing of some enterprises, the statement said the closings should not be `` arbitrary political decisions.'' It said any closures should be preceded by a review of economic performance, with workers and their representatives taking part. `` What should be the first step is the publication of a list of threatened enterprises, and calling upon the employees of these enterprises to undertake attempts at improving the situation,'' it said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> issued a statement Saturday refusing to meet with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> to discuss plans for wide-ranging economic talks with authorities until the shipyard decision was suspended and the government rehired all workers fired for taking part in the August strikes. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> ended the last of the August walkouts after Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> promised that the talks could include the subject of Solidarity's future But the government has since insisted that Solidarity first drop two alleged extremists from its delegation to the talks. That condition, the decision to close the shipyard and the failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for the August strikes has convinced Solidarity leaders that the government is no longer interested in talks. Solidarity was the Soviet bloc's only independent labor movement until it was crushed by security forces in 1981 and outlawed in 1982.

 A powerful earthquake Sunday night shook a sparsely populated mountain region of southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> border, and communications were cut with the stricken area, officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said. At about the same time, a smaller quake was reported in northern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> near the Burmese border. The quake caused minor damage to buildings and swayed high-rise buildings hundreds of miles to the south, in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. In the `` Skylounge'' restaurant on the top floor of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s 43-story Baiyoke Tower, the city's tallest building, hundreds of panicked patrons fled without paying their bills On Saturday another strong quake, measuring 7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, jolted an uninhabited mountain range in northern <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qinghai </LOCATION> province in far western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported in any of the earthquakes. The temblor in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Sunday night was centered in <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province's <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, home to the Lahu minority group, and measured 7.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> measured it at 7.4. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said there was probably some damage in sparsely populated <LOCATION> Lancang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but `` we have no reports.'' He said telephone lines between villages in the county and <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION>, were cut by the quake. The temblor was felt in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>, a city of 1.5 million people 240 miles to the northeast, but caused no damage there, he said. The <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> quake measured 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered in northern <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> province near the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> border. It shattered windows in some buildings in nearby <LOCATION> Chiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION>, authorities said. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake measuring 7 is capable of causing widespread, heavy damage in a populated area, while one measuring 8 on the scale is 10 times as strong and is capable of tremendous damage. Mild earthquakes occur frequently in both areas of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hit by the weekend quakes, but the intensity of these was unusual, seismological officials said.

 Human howls fill the night in the woods of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where hunters and naturalists are on the prowl for the coyote, which is rapidly replacing man and dog as the chief predator of deer. In recent years, the rarely seen coyote has grown in such numbers that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has started a hunting season and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> hunters are worried there soon may be more coyotes than deer. Sheep farmers in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> say the animal is driving some out of business. But conservationists say reports of coyote kills are exaggerated and that the animal is doing some good. `` When you look at the vast majority of coyotes in the state, they are providing a degree of balance and diversity in the wildlife community and in the ecosystem,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more diverse the community, the better it is for everybody.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> is one of the naturalists who howl at night in the huge <LOCATION> Quabbin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The naturalists hope the animal will howl back. From the howls, they say they can learn where the animals hunt and live. One thing the naturalists have learned is the coyotes have driven domestic dogs from the reservoir. The dogs had been a predator of the deer. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has an estimated 1,000 coyotes; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has at least 16,000, officials said. The coyote is among the most intelligent of wild animals, say those who track it. Related to the wolf, the eastern coyote is the size of a small German shepherd with a fox-like head, bushy tail and gray-black coat. It averages four feet long from nose to tail tip and weighs about 40 pounds. The western coyote migrated east in the 1930s, breeding with the Algonquin wolf along the way and evolving into a larger species. Since 1980, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials have confirmed 28 coyote attacks on lambs and other small livestock. All but three of the 75 deer carcasses found last winter at the Quabbin reservoir were killed by coyotes, naturalists said. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> started coyote hunting in 1981 after a handful of farmers claimed coyotes had killed newborn calves. Since then, hunters have killed 20 to 40 coyotes yearly in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> opposed coyote hunting, saying there was insufficient evidence the animals seriously threatened ecological stability. A coyote protection bill failed in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, and the farmers prevailed. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, southwestern wildlife district game manager for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said coyotes may even be a help, since they eat animals killed by cars or other causes and keep such pests as rabbits and field mice under control. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> hunters and sheep farmers, however, call them a menace. Unofficial estimates of the number of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> deer killed by coyotes range from 3,000 to 15,000 yearly. Officials have no estimates on sheep killed. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> has never banned coyote hunting, and officials said at least 1,600 coyotes are killed by hunters and farmers annually. One pro-hunting group, the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coyote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has offered a $ 25 reward for each dead coyote during hunting season, which runs most of the winter. `` I'd poison them if I could,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Skov </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> sheep farmer who said has lost nearly a dozen sheep to coyotes. `` They are just no good.'' She said coyote attacks have helped drive eight small sheep farms out of business in <LOCATION> Waldoboro </LOCATION>, 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, animal damage control adminstrator for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said there are ways to stop the sheep kills. `` A lot of farmers will attest to the fact that if you use a minimum amount of sound husbandry, it's just not a problem,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said coyotes do n't have much of an impact on the deer herd. Since 1986, he said, the herd has been increasing because of bans on hunting doe and other regulations. Coyote hunting continues simply because the animal is far from an endangered species, he said. `` If there is no reason to protect them from harvest, that leaves them open to be harvested,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A painting of vivid yellow and orange flowers in a dark vase, hanging on a faded wall of a little-known museum on the Nile, is an original work by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, French experts say. `` It is real, absolutely real, without doubt,'' <PERSON> Francoise </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Musee d'Orsay, told a news conference Saturday. The one-foot-square canvas is among 350 paintings and other art works at the <ORGANIZATION> Mohammed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mahmoud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which houses the private collection of an Egyptian senator donated to the state by his widow in 1960. The painting attributed to <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>, titled `` Poppies'' by the museum, is being called `` Flowers'' by the French experts until `` we can determine exactly what kind of flowers are in the vase,'' said <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON>. In 1967, Egyptian authorities estimated its value at $ 500,000, but <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON> did n't give any estimate of how much it might be worth today. A van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> painting has commanded the single highest price ever paid for a painting _ his `` Irises'' sold for almost $ 53.9 million in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in November 1987. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s `` Sunflowers'' was sold at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in March 1987 for $ 39.85 million. The authenticity of the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> painting has been questioned since it was stolen in 1978 from the domed, arabesque building on an island on the Nile opposite downtown <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The painting was recovered at an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in 1980. `` It is an authenic <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>,'' said the curator of the museum's paintings, <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacambre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacambre </PERSON>, who was curator of 19th-century painting at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for 20 years, studied the canvas attributed to the Dutch master for three weeks before the results were announced. <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON> said the painting resembles a flower scene painted by the French artist <PERSON> Adolphe </PERSON> <PERSON> Monticelli </PERSON>, whose work deeply affected the young <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Monticelli </PERSON> painting also is part of the <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> collection. `` It is absolutely correct for the technique of early <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON> said. She said the back of the painting has a small, numbered pink label, `` the kind used by French art dealers. `` It would be impossible to imagine someone could copy such a number,'' said <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON>, who also studied a photograph from the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> dealer who sold the painting to <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>. Most of the canvases for which the Dutch-born postimpressionist is remembered were painted in 29 months of frenzied activity before his suicide in 1890 at age 37. The experts said they believed the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> canvas was painted around 1887. <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON> said the painting is in `` a normal condition for a painting that has been stolen.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Malauzat </PERSON>, French Embassy cultural officer, said the oil had `` small flakes of paint missing.'' The painting has been `` in some small accident which seems to be recent, maybe when it was traveling,'' <PERSON> Cachin </PERSON> said. `` It can easily be restored.'' The painting has been taken off display and put in storage at the nearby el-Gezira Museum. Authorities have never fully revealed the details of the theft of the painting. When it was recovered in March 1980, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s then-interior minister, <PERSON> Nabawi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, said three Egyptians involved in the theft had been arrested and informed police where the canvas was left Authorities never reported whether the thieves were charged or tried. Other works in he Khalil collection, all from the 19th-century French school, are by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Courbet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Millet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Malauzat </PERSON> said 90 percent of the the museum's 745 art works _ including 270 sculptures and more than 100 other works _ have been authenticated. `` The majority of paintings are not in bad condition. With proper expertise and cleaning, they will be back to very bright colors,'' <PERSON> Malauzat </PERSON> said.

 A Titan 34D rocket thundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expert said was probably a pair of military communications satellites. The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloud cover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, about 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As usual for military space flights, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did n't announce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload to be put into orbit The Titan 34D probably carried two Satellite Data System satellites, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space policy expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said it also could have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photoreconnaissance spy satellite. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, who knew of the launch in advance, said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> SDS </ORGANIZATION> satellites are used for military communications, especially in the event the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had to launch a nuclear attack. The Titan 34D is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful space booster, although it soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maiden launch next year from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> Two more are scheduled for launch from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> early next year. The last launch of a Titan 34D was from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, but sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it failed to orbit its payload because the rocket's third stage failed to reignite. Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive explosions during launches from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986.

 On election night 1962, a young <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate listened to returns on television in his hotel room while his 6-year-old son sat on the floor drawing pictures. Now, 26 years later, the father plans to be at his son's side as they watch the returns Tuesday that will determine if <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> will become the next governor of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the first Democrat to hold the office in 20 years. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, 32, would also be the youngest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governor in office today. `` I'll feel the same way whether he wins or loses,'' said his father, former three-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>. `` I love him. I'm proud of him, and I do n't think anyone could have done it any better. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s secretary of state, held a 54-40 lead over Republican Lt. Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutz </PERSON> in an <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> poll published Oct. 30. The margin of error was 3.5 points. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> is barred from a third straight term. The race in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state is being watched for the coattail effect of both the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>' a re-election bid. Eleven other states select governors on Tuesday: <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Democrats are favored to retake the governor's office in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The elder <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, who was unseated in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in 1980, is legendary for his personal campaigning style and has been back on the hustings in recent weeks to help his son and other candidates across <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s activity and the famous name he gave his son, <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, have prompted Republicans to complain that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor has an unseemly advantage. `` He inherited a good number of his father's friends,'' the elder <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said, `` but he also inherited his father's enemies.'' He said the famous name helped <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> get attention, but after that, `` he's done it all on his own.'' `` It's very much like the rookie on a baseball team where the All Star leftfielder breaks his arm crashing into the wall and so the rookie gets to play,'' said the elder <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, now 60. `` Now those were circumstances over which he had no control. He was lucky. `` But if he ca n't hit and he ca n't catch and he ca n't throw, he's not going to last. The younger <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> in 1975-76 worked in his father's brief campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a law student, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> managed his father's unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said his son expressed an interest in a career in public service in 1979. `` I told him to make sure you know what you want to do, putting your family first, and think about financial security _ all the kinds of advice I did n't take when I was his age,'' said <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, now a lawyer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It was n't daddy beating him over the back saying, ` Here, you've got ta do this You've got ta do that,''' he said. `` It's really been his idea.'' Since entering politics, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> `` has his own ideas, his own campaign,'' his father said. The senior <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> offers his guidance, giving his son the benefit of his experience. `` But it's up to him to make the call,'' he said.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police shut down a business called the `` Only Nude Car Wash in the Nation,'' advising the owner that hiring naked women to scrub cars is against the law. Five women _ nude dancers turned car buffers _ and three male nightclub employees were cited when police put an end to the weekly event in a carport adjoining the Fantasy World club, assistant manager <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said Sunday. The manager, a weightlifter whose stage name is `` The Mad Dog,'' was also arrested on a felony charge of resisting arrest with violence. <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> denied the charge against manager <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, saying police used `` brutal force'' against <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> in the Saturday raid of the adults-only club. <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for observation after complaining of shoulder injuries, was returned to jail and posted bond Sunday, <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said. The club's marquee boasts the car wash's singular status. `` We have girls that wash cars in the nude. They are in an enclosed area. We have a screened off drive-through area that is part of the building. Do n't think that they are visible,'' <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said. `` There's blue tarp all the way around.'' Police wanted to close the $ 10-per wash operation when it opened in mid-September but waited for word from the state attorney's office that the arrests were legal `` It should have been closed down the first week,'' said vice Detective <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Deal </PERSON>. `` Once they started the car wash, the state attorney had to research whether it was a violation of the law.'' The state attorney's office gave police the go-ahead on the premise that operating the car wash constituted a breach of the peace and violation of public nudity laws, <PERSON> Deal </PERSON> said. `` Needless to say, there is not a statute that says <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> shall not have nude car washes,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, deputy director of the state attorney's county court division. `` But the case law on public nudity and breach of peace support it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said attorneys had n't heard of any other nude car washes, but they knew of a doughnut shop staffed by topless employees in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. Fantasy World owner <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Colazzo </PERSON> started the car wash as part of his protest against a year-old city law banning topless dancing at businesses that sell alcohol. The nude dancers were charged with breach of the peace and public nudity, and the men were charged with breach of the peace and aiding in public nudity. All are misdemeanors. `` Needless to say, our car wash has been closed until this case is settled in court,'' <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cowen Owen Freed To Serve Trafficking Sentence In U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An American convicted of cocaine smuggling in a case that attracted the attention of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general left prison Sunday under a deal that allows him to serve his sentence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conan </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 24, a photographer and a former summer intern in Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office, left <ORGANIZATION> Carcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modelo </ORGANIZATION> in handcuffs and under police escort. He had been held there since his arrest March 13, 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s El Prat airport. As he walked through the prison patio to a waiting police van, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> raised his hands defiantly to show he was handcuffed. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was taken to the <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> police headquarters, according to the officer in charge, who demanded anonymity. It was believed <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> would spend the night there and be turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals Monday in time to catch a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was convicted in April of drug trafficking and sentenced to six years and a day. At his March 26 trial, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified he was tricked into carrying a suitcase from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> in which customs police found four pounds of cocaine. He said the people who had given him a free-lance photo assignment sent him to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> after a few days work in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>, who gave <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> the assignment, later told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials he and others placed the cocaine in the suitcase without <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s knowledge. <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON> provided that information to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in return for a suspended sentence and a promise he would not be turned over to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> authorities. The <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> court refused to admit <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s deposition as evidence in <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION>'s trial because plea-bargaining is illegal in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s transfer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is allowed under an international treaty <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed in 1983. To become eligible for return, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> had to drop his appeal of the trafficking conviction. The prosecutor also dropped an appeal calling for an additional conviction on contraband charges which the three-judge <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> court threw out. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s attorney and the photographer's family in <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, have refused to discuss the case with reporters. The Spanish news media have questioned the degree of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference in the country's legal system after the personal appeal for <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s release by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Citing <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, some newspapers claimed the photographer was an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy. During a weekly Cabinet meeting Oct. 28, the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government agreed to <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s request to be transferred to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In February, a month before <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to sign a supplementary extradtion treaty with Spanish Justice Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON>. At the time <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told reporters he was delivering a copy of <PERSON> Barahona </PERSON>'s deposition to <PERSON> Ledesma </PERSON> in the hopes that charges against <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> would be dropped. After <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s conviction, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said through a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman that he `` regrets very much this action by the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> court ... I think it's important to stress that we continue to believe ... in Mr. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s innocence, and we continue to hope that he will ultimately be exonerated.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, as of six months ago, there were six Americans serving time in Spanish jails on drug-related charges, and another nine, including <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who were awaiting trial on drug charges.

 Here are excerpts from a speech delivered Sunday by Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: I brought with me this issue book because you know, we're limited today to the sound bites. We're in the everything-kind-of-controlled no matter whether you give a good speech or a lousy one ... Here it is on issues, 350 pages, the issues. And they're issues that are of concern to the American people. And we've been talking about them in depth, on foreign affairs or education or ethics or whatever it is. And somehow I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are awful smart. They do n't need three or four husky-voiced commentators to tell them what they know. They know what they see. They study. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prestige is on the move again. We're rolling up our sleeves to work, not to have our pulse taken. ... I'm a sportsman, an outdoorsman. I go hunting every year religiously, love fishing, love the parks and I am pledged to do a better job on the environment of ours. I will push to clean up toxic waste. I will stop ocean dumping. I will save the oceans and protect and expand our beautiful parks. that is my commitment, that is my heartbeat. ... We simply can not go back to the policies of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and turn over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the very same people who claim to be on your side but who left <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on its back. ... They do n't want that leadership to be flashy. They want it to be solid. They want it to be experienced. They want leadership that's not going to make a lot of empty promises ... As I near the end of this very long arduous journey, I think of the larger issues that this election is really about. My thoughts keep coming back to the most serous responsibility of a president, and that is advancing freedom and protecting the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Just yesterday the papers reported that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is _ hopefully temporarily _ but it's halting now their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. These events are a stark reminder that power remains a very important part of world politics. To protect peace and advance the cause of freedom, a president must have the experience to know when and how to use power, the prudent use of power and be willing to do so when he has to do that. And the new president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, believe me will be tested on all fronts. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will only be one. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s twists and turns present a great opportunity. And yes, there's hope as he wrestles now with glasnost, the openness, and peristroika, the reform. It's a challenging time to lead the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 West Germans began a solemn remembrance Sunday of the Nazi Kristallnacht, the brutal night of terror a half-century ago that led to the Holocaust. Residents of this picturesque town north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> placed a wreath at the site where the synagogue was burned down Nov. 10, 1938. Over the next few days, hundreds of local gatherings, panel discussions and expositions will be held throughout <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The major national day of observance takes place in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on Wednesday, 50 years to the day after the pogrom began. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, Jewish leaders and city officials unveiled five plaques to commemorate the destruction of 49 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> synagogues by Nazi terror squads. East Germans for weeks have been staging Kristallnacht ceremonies, emphasizing how Communists and Jews were persecuted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s tiny Jewish community, said his nation appears to be learning more from the lessons of the past than <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` In the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, there's a greater cracking down on neo-fascist ways of thought than in the Federal Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, where meetings of former <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> can take place under police protection,'' <PERSON> Kirchner </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The terror began the night of Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi thugs burned synagogues, destroyed Jewish businesses and beat up Jews. The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> dubbed the night Kristallnacht _ or `` Crystal Night'' _ because of shards of broken glass that filled the streets. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Foschepoth </PERSON>, general secretary of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Societies for Christian-Jewish cooperation, said the Kristallnacht marked `` the start of a new phase, the phase of the physical annihilation of the Jews.'' Historians agree the Kristallnacht was the first major step in the systematic Nazi campaign to annihilate European Jews. The Nazis murdered an estimated 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of other opponents during their 1933-1945 rule. `` Throughout the entire <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> that night, 91 Jews met their death under the sticks, boots and bullets of the death squads of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> movement,'' Foschepoth told 125 people in <LOCATION> Koenigstein </LOCATION>. At least 195 synagogues and about 7,500 Jewish businesses were either destroyed or badly damaged. `` How was this all possible?'' <PERSON> Foschepoth </PERSON> asked. `` We ca n't get away from this continuing question.'' The extent of the ceremonies in the next few days, reaching into even the smallest communities, may be unprecedented in a country filled with public reminders of Nazi terror. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community and a survivor of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, has been at the center of a controversy over whether he should address Parliament at its ceremony Thursday. `` It would have looked good for the reputation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> if one of those directly affected ... had been given the opportunity to say a public word from such a podium on that day, especially because of the significance of that day,'' <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said last week. He has not been invited. About 32,000 Jews now live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while the number of practicing Jews in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is estimated to be 450 to 600. Along with solemn ceremonies, there will also be reminders that times have changed. In the city of <LOCATION> Darmstadt </LOCATION>, a 45-minute drive south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, a new synagogue will be dedicated Wednesday.

 In a million-dollar, nationwide appeal hours before the polls open Election Day, Democrat presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will urge Americans to `` look in the mirror'' and ask themselves, `` Is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side?'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign bought 30 minutes beginning at 8 p.m. EST Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television networks to broadcast a program in which the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor will answer questions posed by people in various regions of the country. A partial transcript of the program was made public Sunday. Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign has purchased 30 minutes on the same three networks beginning at 8:30 p.m. EST on election eve. `` People are starving in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, says on the program. `` People are losing their home, they are six months late in their bills. People ca n't buy homes because they do n't have any jobs ... do n't have any money.'' `` People starving in this country?'' responded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Their houses being foreclosed on because there are no jobs down there? `` Is n't the responsibility of the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go to work and invest for the people of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and bring business and labor and the educational community together?'' Asked by <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Crapsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, what he would do to help farmers, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied, `` I think the family farm is a very precious institution in this country and I know that working with our family farmers, we can get them a fair price for our crops.'' In an excerpt from his standard stump speech, the Democratic candidate said the only new idea proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` a new $ 40 billion, five-year capital gains giveaway for the very rich.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added: `` Now who is going to pay for that tax break? Look beside you. Look behind you. Look in the mirror and ask yourself _ Is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side?'' Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appears on the program to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercials. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said voters were `` deeply concerned about <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee -RRB- and as this Election Day gets closer they're disturbed with the idea that if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were to win he would be a heartbeat away from the presidency.''

 Indian commandos rescued 20 hostages and recovered bodies of four others aboard a crippled getaway ship Sunday after gunmen who tried to overthrow the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> government surrendered, Indian officials said. Officials reported three hostages were missing. Armed Sri Lankan mercenaries ended a two-day high seas standoff early Sunday after the Indian frigate Godavari fired on the cargo vessel 60 miles from the Sri Lankan coast, Indian officials said. They said the alleged mastermind of Thursday's bloody coup attempt, an aide to former <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, was among the 46 people who surrendered. <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> has denied involvement in the coup. A Maldivian spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>, said about 100 people suspected of sympathizing with the coup had been rounded up for questioning, most Maldivian citizens. The nationalities of the others were uncertain, but they spoke the Tamil language of the mercenaries, said <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON>, who uses only one name. Some Tamil-speakers from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> come to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to work. The Indian marine commandos recovered the bodies of four hostages from the Maldivian-registered ship, Indian government spokesman <PERSON> Ramamohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said he did not know how the hostages died. Interviews with survivors indicated three other hostages were missing, he said. Seven of the surviving hostages, including Transport Minister <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujithaba </PERSON>, had bullet wounds and were flown to the south <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Trivandrum </LOCATION> for treatment, <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> said he had not been informed of any hostage deaths. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said the Indian navy was returning the alleged mastermind _ <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> _ and the captured mercenaries to the 2,000-island nation. President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> said they would be put on trial. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> was a former aide to <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON>, whose followers also tried to overthrow <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> in 1980 and 1983. Asked what punishment they would receive if convicted, <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> told a news conference: `` I ca n't tell you at this time, but we do have capital punishment.'' The president, who looked relaxed and cheerful, said authorities granted no concessions to the mercenaries for their surrender. The Maldives' foreign minister, <PERSON> Fathulla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> hired the mercenaries and came ashore with them Thursday. <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said earlier that <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> was seen giving orders and brandishing a pistol during the fighting. <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> had entered the presidential palace and `` sat on the president's desk just to assert he had taken over the country.'' <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>, 50, was elected president in 1978 after <PERSON> Nasir </PERSON> abruptly resigned and fled to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> where he still lives. The 62-year-old ex-president has been accused by the <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> government of misappropriating $ 4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule. Two Indian frigates had trailed the mercenaries for two days as their listing ship limped across the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, about 475 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, also known as the <LOCATION> Maldive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The mercenaries fled Male early Friday, shortly after Indian paratroopers landed in <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> to help <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> and his lightly armed, 1,200-member security forces. Maldivian and Indian officials said most of the estimated 150 mercenaries escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have searched area waters and islands for them. According to <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON>, the foreign minister, the official casualty toll from Thursday's fighting was 14 dead and 40 wounded. He said eight Maldivian security men, three mercenaries and three civilians were killed. Several Indian and <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> officials earlier put the death toll at about 20 or 30. <PERSON> Jameel </PERSON> said the mercenaries were members of a Sri Lankan militant group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamils </ORGANIZATION>. The Tamil separatist group is one of several fighting the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan government.

 At least 153 prisoners escaped through a tunnel from a military detention camp in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> before dawn Sunday, but 78 were captured, officials said. Almost all the prisoners had been detained on suspicion of belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese radical group blamed by authorities for more than 500 killings in the last 15 months. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prisoners dug a tunnel at the <LOCATION> Pelawatta </LOCATION> camp, about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Police and soldiers captured 78 of the escapees, the government's information department said It gave no details but said searches were under way for the others. The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the Sinhalese-dominated government's peace accord for ending a separatist war by Tamil guerrillas. The front said the accord, which was signed July 30, 1987, makes too many concessions to the Tamil ethnic minority.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is planning a memorial at the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> where thousands of Polish army officers were murdered during World War II, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The memorial was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. It gave no dates for construction. The newspaper said it will be the first monument for prisoners of war in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has thousands of monuments to its own heroes of World War II. The existence of the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> grave was announced by the German government in 1943. It said it had found a mass grave of 4,250 Polish officers near <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> is 12 miles west of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. The Soviets said in 1944 the officers were slain by the Germans, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation accused the Soviets. The Culture Ministry official quoted in the article, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananiev </PERSON>, acknowledged that Western sources have accused Soviet secret police of committing the massacre, while the Soviets have long blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` I can not be a judge in these debates,'' <PERSON> Ananiev </PERSON> said, `` but I know that some time ago specialists were in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, conducted excavations there, and proved the Polish officers were shot with <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> weapons.'' <PERSON> Ananiev </PERSON> said he did not know how many were killed at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Singer Apologizes Again For Benefit Concert; Police Boycott Called

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Country singer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> has apologized again for a concert he performed in to benefit an Indian later convicted of killing two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. As a result, police have canceled a boycott of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s concert here Thursday. Sgt. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Flammia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, two weeks ago asked officers not to work as security officials at the concert because <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> sang at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> benefit for <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>. The proceeds went toward <PERSON> Peltier </PERSON>'s legal defense. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> met earlier this year with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> and the Fraternal Order of the Police and issued a blanket apology for the concert. But <PERSON> Flammia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> never had specifically apologized in his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, explaining the state's umbrella police organization, Combined Law Enforcement Associations of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is not affiliated with the other groups. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> issued another apology Friday night from his home in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` I deeply regret that so many police officers and police organizations were offended by the Indian concert,'' he said. `` In the future, I will certainly consider all aspects of any benefit concert so as not to offend anyone. I have nothing but respect for all lawmen and under no circumstances do I support cop killers.''

 <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> has become the latest ex-leader to lose an honor that was bestowed upon him after death. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Sunday that government officials rescinded a decision to name a passenger ship after <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the Communist Party chief. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> died March 11, 1985. Officials decided to name a Polish-built ship capable of carrying 400 people and 150 cars after him. The ship was commissioned in December 1986. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> served as Soviet leader just 13 months, after the late <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> and just before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He had been a lackluster <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> lieutenant and his rise to the top was considered the Old Guard's last attempt at retaining power. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, many things have been named and renamed as leaders _ most notably <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> _ rise and fall in esteem. In January, authorities stripped a city, town squares and a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood of the name of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, the Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blames <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> for a `` period of stagnation'' in the Soviet economy, creation of a cumbersome bureaucracy and public skepticism about the leadership. After <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982, a city of 460,000 called <PERSON> Naberezhnyie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelny </PERSON> was renamed for him, along with an atomic icebreaker, a naval vessel, a passenger liner, an army tank division, a metallurgical institute, a military academy, a nuclear power plant, and a dam. Dozens of cities were named for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his lieutenants. But they reverted back to their original names after the dictator's death in 1953 Soviet history has only recently begun to acknowledge that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> murdered millions of his own people.

 Television watchers of the 19th annual <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marathon </LOCATION> followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of the leaders, but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands of runners for a familar face. The winner in the field of 23,478 _ largest ever for a marathon _ was <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, who finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds, only seven seconds off the course record. <PERSON> Grete </PERSON> <PERSON> Waitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> won the women's division for a record ninth time in 2:28:07. <PERSON> Marybeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Torpe </PERSON> was hoping another runner would run fast _ her boyfriend <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Giannelli </PERSON>. She and several others had staked out the corner table at a restaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as they romped off the <LOCATION> Queensboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Their hopes on seeing <PERSON> Giannelli </PERSON> depended on how fast the Yonkers native ran. `` We have to leave this table by 12:30. The manager's kicking us out,'' said one of <PERSON> Giannelli </PERSON>'s friends, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Koogan </PERSON> <PERSON> Torpe </PERSON> was eager for <PERSON> Giannelli </PERSON> to finish, too. `` I'm going to ask him to marry me today,'' she said, holding up the rose she planned to give him. Crowds cheered for the those in the lead packs and the also-rans on the warm, sunny autumn day. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, a sophomore at <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> -RRB- High School, waited on First Avenue near 60th Street hoping to catch a glimpse of her English teacher, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paciorkowski </PERSON>. But she was not taking any chances on missing him. `` Mr. <PERSON> Paciorkowski </PERSON> told us if he saw a television camera, he'd wave to us,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said _ as she held a small portable television in her hand All along the marathon route, volunteers handed drinks to runners, but <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairlamb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had prepared a special elixir of carrot juice. He handed them out to the 50 or so runners in the `` Natural Living'' running club who passed his table at 61st Street and First Avenue. `` Last night I went into <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and got 500 pounds of carrots from a food co-op. We juiced them starting at 5 this morning,'' he said. In Central Park, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrego </PERSON> stood on the railing with a bullhorn, waiting for his favorites in the race to pass. He did n't have any trouble finding them `` I'm cheering for <PERSON> Grete </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>,'' Mr. <PERSON> Borrego </PERSON> said, referring to the winners. `` They're both so courteous, full of good sportsmanship.

<TEXT>
 A letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> trustees deploring a student newspaper's comparison of the school's president with <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> will be sent to all students and faculty members, a spokesman said Sunday. Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> wrote the letter Saturday to President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> saying the board of trustees is `` shocked and outraged'' at the characterization by The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, an off-campus weekly not affiliated with the college. <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> called it `` particularly offensive in light of your own Jewish heritage.'' Without stopping `` free and even offensive speech'' at the school, he said, the board has a right to speak out against `` ignorance and moral blindness.'' College spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> said Sunday the letter would be sent to every student and faculty member on Monday. The letter was in reaction to an Oct. 19 column in the Review headlined `` <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Volk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedmann </PERSON>,'' a play on a Nazi slogan, `` One Empire, One People, One Leader'' but substituting and misspelling <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s name. Written by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, the column describes how `` Der Freedmann'' and his associates rid the campus of conservatives. The column refers to the `` Final Solution of the Conservative Problem'' and to survivors of the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> `` holocaust.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> described <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> friends and colleagues who were `` deported in cattle cars in the night.'' A drawing on the cover of the Oct. 26 issue depicted <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> as <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> found the column `` distasteful and unpleasant.'' A full-page advertisement signed by four associate faculty deans attacking the Review appeared last week in The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>, the official daily student newspaper, as did a copy of a letter from 11 faculty members to The Review's outside advisers. `` The fact that President <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> is Jewish raises the stakes in a rather frightening way,'' the faculty members wrote, urging the advisers to reconsider allowing their names to be associated with the publication. `` The comparison of the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> president to <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is so wildly inappropriate that one can only assume insidious motives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> also took issue with its off-campus competitor in an editorial last week. `` The column is anti-Semitic; its impact rings through this community today and will remain long after its publishers have completed their stints in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Harmeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhillon </PERSON>, editor in chief of the Review, said the column was n't anti-Semitic and that the point was misinterpreted. She said the paper sought to compare `` liberal fascism'' with other forms of fascism and was n't meant to trivialize the Holocaust. Rather, the paper wanted to show how <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> mistreated conservative students by trying to `` get rid of people he does n't like. `` We do n't like him and we equated him with an anti-Semite,'' she said. `` We do n't see how that makes us anti-Semitic. ... It was excessive. We admit that. We obviously did n't think anyone would take it literally.'' <PERSON> Dhillon </PERSON> said the Review had a tradition of support for Jews and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> had written a column a year ago condemning the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. She said <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s Jewish heritage did n't come up during discussions to print the column. `` We've had a long war of words with President <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>,'' she said. In March, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> gave a speech denouncing Review reporters as `` ideological provocateurs posing as journalists'' who engage in `` malicious bullying tactics'' that threaten <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to diversity. That same month, the college suspended three white Review staffers for disrupting class and harassing a black professor. The newspaper since has filed civil suits in state and federal courts against the college, accusing it of reverse discrimination and free-speech violations.

<TEXT>
 More than 800 Salvadoran war refugees returned home Sunday after spending eight years in a camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and said they were happy but fearful and wanted only to live and work in peace. Carrying their meager belongings, the refugees crossed the border at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poy </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, in a convoy of 36 buses and 89 trucks. Vehicle problems delayed their departure Saturday from the <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> camp, 22 miles inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and 50 miles east of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poy </LOCATION>. `` We fear for our lives because the repression continues,'' said a young man who gave his name only as <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON>. `` My idea is to work the land and that they let us work in peace.'' He said the refugees were returning `` to rebuild what the Salvadoran army destroyed, and it even massacred many families, friends and brothers in the place where I lived.'' He refused to comment further. <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON>, a refugee leader, said: `` We are all very happy to be in our country and we hope that they let us work in peace, since our government told us we have the constitutional right to return to the places we are from.'' The refugees join 4,300 others who returned from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1,230 who came back in August. Although some say the camps are like jails, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees says 14,000 refugees have chosen to remain in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, 3,600 preferred to stayed behind, despite the poverty and makeshift housing. Many said they were afraid to return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>, an 18-year-old who has been at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> since he was 10, said in an interview there Saturday he does n't like the camp but felt he would be risking his life returning to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Back home, the refugees will confront suspicions that they are collaborators of leftist guerrillas fighting a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government. `` They come to live near the hydroelectric dams and serve as suppliers of the guerrillas,'' Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Belloso </PERSON> <PERSON> Funes </PERSON>, who met the refugees as they returned, said: `` Some are collaborators of the guerrillas, but I ca n't say they all are.'' Refugee leader <PERSON> Lainez </PERSON> questioned how the refugees could be accused of working with the guerrillas after living for eight years in a place where they can not come or go without permission of the Honduran army. The Honduran government has pushed for repatriation of the refugees for several years, saying the camps have become sanctuaries for guerrillas who operate along the border. About 65,000 people have died in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war, the majority of them civilians.

 An elderly couple is suing their son for allegedly defrauding them of their home by having it put in his name to save money on inheritance taxes. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, a retired fruit seller, and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, who are in their late 70s, two years ago agreed to put the house in their son's name. The agreement called for <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 52, to be responsible for upkeep of the house while his parents lived there on a 25-year lease, the Freemans said. The deal allowed them to cancel if they wanted and have the title put back in their name, they said. But the younger <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> has n't made some necessary repairs, the Freemans said, and they've sued to get the property back, without the $ 100,000 mortgage they say their son took out on the house to get a line of credit. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> challenged his parents' claim and now both sides are scheduled to meet in court in January.

 The French turned out in record low numbers Sunday for a referendum on the future of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, but those who did vote overwhelmingly approved a plan the government hopes will buy 10 years of peace in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory. Turnout was 37.32 percent, the lowest of any national election since World War II. The figure confirmed a widespread lack of interest in the referendum despite violence between native Melanesians and European settlers that has killed 40 people in the past four years. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has controlled the territory since 1853. With 96 percent of the French results in and counting stopped for the night, 79.91 percent had voted `` yes'' on a statute that would clear the way for a 1998 vote on independence for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The `` no'' votes totaled 20.09 percent. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, 11,000 miles from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the polls closed 12 hours before those in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Official results there showed 57.03 percent voted `` yes,'' and 42.9 percent `` no.'' Turnout was 63.24 percent. `` Democracy has spoken,'' said Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> shortly after the French polls closed. `` It appears that 12 million French have just approved the -LRB- proposed new -RRB- statute.'' The voters were asked whether they approved a new local autonomy statute for the archipelago for the next 10 years, followed by a local referendum on independence. Most of the native Melanesians known as Kanaks, who make up 43 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s 145,000 inhabitants, want independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. They are opposed by most of the European settlers, who comprise 37 percent, and Asians and Polynesians, who comprise 20 percent. Sporadic violence has erupted between Kanaks and the white population since 1984, culminating in a hostage-taking affair last spring that left 25 dead. On April 22, a group of Melanesians attacked a police station at <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION> on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, killing four policemen and taking 27 hostage before retreating to a cave. After negotiations failed, police attacked the cave May 5 and rescued the hostages, but 19 Melanesians and two policemen died. That episode sobered both pro-independence and anti-independence leaders and brought them to the negotiating table. In June, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafleur </PERSON>, head of the Rally for <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> in the Republic party signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Under the agreement: _ Those charged with political crimes committed before Aug. 20 will be amnestied, except those directly implicated in murder _ The archipelago will be divided into three provinces, each with its own provincial assembly The three assemblies will together form a territorial congress. _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> will be governed directly from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> until July 1989, when local administrations will take over _ A program of economic development and administrative training will be implemented _ In 1998, a referendum will be held on independence, but only those people now residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> will be able to vote Only the extreme right <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has campaigned for a `` no'' vote in the referendum.

The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate was interviewed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Nov. 1 and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was interviewed in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Oct. 22. `` It's not over until it's over,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was interviewed from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I would think that with the surge the Democrats are now feeling across the country, gaps closing in states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, if we continue this momentum through the weekend, we could be just at that ... miracle quotient that <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> experienced -LRB- in 1948 -RRB- and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> later in 1960,'' he said. Interviewer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> whether he believed that because he is n't on the ticket, blacks will be disillusioned and stay away from the polls. `` Blacks have been disillusioned and yet blacks are resilient,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, but he conceded there would be `` a higher degree of enthusiasm'' if he were a candidate. Asked what his role in the administration would be if the Democrats win, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied: `` We've discussed no role and I have no interest at this point in a role.'' Frost asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whether he believes `` liberal'' is a bad word. `` Well I think there are certain things in the liberal tradition, standing up for the little guy, that's good. But liberal has taken on a different connotation in American politics, or else why would the opponent have been running away from the label for so long?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> then asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whether he was glad <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was now describing himself as a liberal, in the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` He can do what he wants to do. I think I have every right to point it out. In the -LRB- second -RRB- debate he got all over me like ugly on an ape for even bringing it up,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, using a phrase he said he first heard in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil fields in 1948. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described himself as a `` liberal'' in the tradition of the presidents who gave <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> social security, the minimum wage and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> but added, `` I'm also a lot more fiscally conservative than Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' He accused the Republicans of attempting `` to convey the sense that if you're a quote liberal, you do n't have values, you do n't have standards. `` Now, why are they doing this? I think it's because they want people to forget that in a very real sense, they've had one of the most liberal borrow and spending sprees we've ever had in this country. It's the antithesis of conservatism.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he reacted too slowly to the `` negative kind of campaigning that apparently was part and parcel of Republican strategy from the beginning.'' But he said he could never wage a relentlessly negative campaign even if it meant certain victory in the election.

 Here are excerpts of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech Sunday: `` For months, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been following me around on the issues. Have you noticed? He discovered education a few months ago. He even discovered the environment a few months ago, after being a member of the original wrecking crew that went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, remember, in 1981 ... `` In recent days he's been following me around the country.

I think you have to earn the right to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staters </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Republcians have run the most critical and the most hypocritical campaign I think I've ever seen in my political career. Full of distortions and lies and just plain garbage. `` But as they slip they're going to become more and more desperate, and you're going to be seeing and hearing more of this right up to Tuesday. The latest one is gun control. `` You've been hearing about it, have n't you, here in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. I've always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to buy and own weapons and to use them. That's not what I'm concerned about. It's not what you're concerned about. We're concerned about teenagers with Uzis and AK-47s running around our cities killing people. `` We're concerned about crack gangs and drug dealers that are threatening the lives of our law enforcement officers. ... We're concerned about cop killer bullets We think there ought to be at least a seven-day waiting period before a convicted felon or somebody with a history of mental illness walks into a store and buys a gun. That's what we're concerned about. ... `` I support the right of people to protect themselves in their own homes, subject to state regulation. This is a law enforcement issue. That's what it is. And that's what I'm talking about. And I hope you'll take that message back to your friends and your communities.'' `` We ca n't let these lies and distortions stand unanswered in this campaign, and we're not going to. We're not going to.''

<HEAD>Two Killed As Guerrillas Blow Up Power Towers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two people, possibly leftist extremists, were killed and two others injured in a late-night bombing of several electrical towers that blacked out much of central <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, police said Sunday. In telephone calls to local newspapers, the country's principle urban guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for blowing up at least eight high-voltage towers in central <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday. `` It's a warning to -LRB- military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>,'' the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for the group as saying. `` He's got to go.'' The 72-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost an Oct. 5 referendum on extending his rule. Open elections to pick a successor are planned for late next year, but political opponents are calling on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to step down sooner. The blasts knocked out power to a 400-mile expanse including this capital city, where more than 4 million of the country's 12 million people live. The outage stretched from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION>, 295 miles to the north. In <LOCATION> Temuco </LOCATION>, 420 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, police said they found the badly damaged bodies of a man and a woman killed the previous night in the bombing of an electrical pole. Police said a knapsack containing explosives and two handguns was found near the bodies, indicating the victims may have been blown up by their own bomb. Police said they found and disactivated bombs at two other towers in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION>. A couple parked in a truck in the town of <LOCATION> Talagante </LOCATION>, about 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, were injured when a nearby bomb went off at a nearby electrical tower, police said, adding that at least six other towers in the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> area were bombed. Some <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> neighborhoods remained without electricity for more than an hour before lights went back on early Sunday. Also Sunday, an anti-government street rally called by labor unions to demand <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s resignation drew only a few thousand people. Neither organizers nor police gave a crowd estimate, but journalists calculated attendance at no more than 5,000, much lower than the hundreds of thousands who attended rallies before the referendum. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> siezed power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A pastor appealed Sunday for spiritual understanding of the terrorists holding nine Americans hostage in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as an interdenominational service pondered news from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Oh, God of all people, teach us how to pray now for those we identify as enemies in our lives,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kojis </PERSON>, who was aboard a jetliner in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> that was damaged by a terrorist bomb in 1986. <PERSON> Kojis </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Wauwatosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was among seven clergy of several denominations participating in a prayer service for the hostages at the <ORGANIZATION> Underwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauwatosa </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Kojis </PERSON> said he wanted to discuss the captors as well and what might have motivated them to take <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was captured March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage. A videotape in which <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> says President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have not done enough to secure his release surfaced last Monday. Sunday's event was planned for several months and was not intended as a political message, said the Rev. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Trulson </PERSON>, pastor at the host church. About 50 people attended. They spoke about <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the other hostages, the hostages' families and those negotiating for their release with shadowy captors `` Part of us wants to destroy our enemies, terminate them, wipe them off the face of the earth. Part of us is blinded in the dark about who the captors really are,'' <PERSON> Kojis </PERSON> said. `` Some of us here have neatly divided the situation into two camps: us and them.'' `` Deeper than those things that divide us from the captors, there is that which unites us. We are all brothers and sisters,'' he said. <PERSON> Kojis </PERSON> said he and his family have had time to recover since a bomb exploded across the aisle from them in a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner April 2, 1986, killing four occupants. When he heard what the other pastors planned to say during the memorial service, he said, he chose to concentrate on the captors because `` it was going involve a lot of reflection.'' `` To try to walk in your enemies' shoes, to empathize, which seems so difficult,'' he said. `` How do you walk in the shoes of your captor? I think those are all the challenges that await us in faith.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was a particular focus of the service because of the attention surrounding his recent birthday, the videotape, and new photographs of him distributed last month. One photo was delivered to a Western news agency Friday along with a statement from the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would not take `` realistic steps'' to end the ordeal of 14 captives held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, nine of whom are American. In the most recent photograph <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is pictured before a birthday cake. Oct. 27 was his 41st birthday.

 All but one of the fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> has been declared controlled following recent snowfalls, the park announced Sunday. Just the Clover-Mist blaze, which burned in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, is not declared controlled, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>.

Active firefighting efforts on the blazes ended weeks ago, but officials have continued to keep a close eye on the fires. As of Saturday, more than 200 people and four helicopters were keeping watch. Officials have estimated that the fires covered an area of 1.1 million acres, burning about 20 percent of that. Snow depths in the 2.2 million-acre park on Sunday ranged from an inch or less to as much as a foot. The snow also forced park officials on Sunday to close <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south and east entrances, probably until the spring. Other roads in the park remain open.

 One person matched all six numbers in the Illinois Lotto to win at least $ 38 million, the state's second largest jackpot ever, officials said Sunday. The player, who has not stepped forward to claim the prize, will receive the money in annual payments after taxes over the next 20 years, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, director of the state lottery. Saturday's drawing capped a week of `` Lotto fever'' in which ticket sales totaled $ 26.7 million, including $ 11.5 million on Saturday alone. The state's 4,100 machines processed a record 26,000 tickets per minute in the hour before the 7 p.m. drawing, and sales topped $ 1.1 million an hour. The prize grew as no one matched all the Lotto numbers for three consecutive weeks. The winning numbers were: 33, 35, 43, 44, 45, and 52.

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Sunday that the presidential campaign, no matter who wins, will not leave the next president with a `` serious mandate.'' That `` means more work and a lot more swabbing that has to be done, and I think <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can do that,'' he said of his party's standard-bearer <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared on both <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' and on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had also been invited but turned down the invitation, and journalists on the show said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had appeared on no national television interview shows during the campaign. On CBS, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> predicted that congressional Democrats would not gang up on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were elected. `` Not gang up, no, but I do n't think he gets any brownie points -LRB- from -RRB- the kind of campaign he's run. It's been an extremely negative one,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> reiterated his indignation at the Republican's negative advertising. `` They've had an effect and they've hurt and they demean the process,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife and one of his sons defended the vice president on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't persuade me that <PERSON> George </PERSON> has run a dirty campaign,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He has n't.'' <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` fair game'' and he did n't expect his father to face resentment if elected. `` My dad has a great ability to heal wounds,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would find a stalemate greeting him because of a lack of a mandate on specific issues, said: `` Frankly, I do n't think either candidate at this point has a serious mandate.'' Afterward, he told reporters, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will not have as much of a mandate as he deserves because it was difficult to get the issues across with all the clutter of negative advertising. But I also believe the two of us together, with me as vice president ... that we will be able to get our legislative program through better than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that if he returned to his post as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he would not try to use that forum to wreak vengeance on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We have to much at stake in this country to try to seek revenge or something like that,'' he said. `` We're on a mountain of debt in this country, and our budget deficit and our trade deficit, and those things have to be turned around.'' `` I'd work with any president, for my country. I'd help when I thought he was right, and I'd try to block him when I thought he was wrong,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` That's what I hired out to do.'' Asked to look at 1992 if the Republicans won this time, the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> declined to say if he'd run for president. `` I believe in 1992 ... I'll be running for vice president and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be finishing a first and successful term of office,'' he said. When reporters asked him later if this was his last campaign, he joked, `` What do you mean, a kid like me? I've been in politics long enough to know to never say never.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> headed back to his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after appearing on the network interview shows in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategist and pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said his surveys showed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the state that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to help win, was firmly in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column and a statewide newspaper poll backed up that assertion. A survey sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 56-39 lead in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The survey had a four-point margin of error. `` If they had it all locked up, why is the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign dumping a half million dollars in negative ads'' in the state, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said at a rally in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stop in the state and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spending were also evidence it was close, he said. `` Let's go flat out for the next couple of days,'' he told the crowd of about 800 in the local civic center. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a rally outside the city's train station that the Democrats are concerned about the middle class _ a theme <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been hammering in his campaign stops. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are on the side of the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Republicans are on the other side,'' said the Democratic candidate, who addressed the crowd in both Spanish and English _ an appeal to the state's large Hispanic population. As <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s motorcade worked its way through the streets of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, citizens honked their car horns with approval.

 Police were preparing for about 2,000 people to attend the funeral Monday of a cadet who became ill and needed a liver transplant after a vigorous training program at a police academy. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, 25, was one of 16 cadets hospitalized during the first week of training at the state police academy in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. The cases of exhaustion and dehydration among the class of 50 cadets prompted at least three state inquiries and resulted in the resignation of the head of the state's police training program. <ORGANIZATION> Pittsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> called <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s sudden turn for the worst last week `` a shocking change.'' The cadet had emerged from a coma and was slowly recovering _ even writing his wife, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, `` I made it'' _ although he was too weak to breathe or speak on his own. He lost consciousness Oct. 31 and was operated on to remove a blood clot on his brain. He never regained consciousness and died Wednesday. An autopsy on Friday indicated that he died from infections that set in because of his weakened condition from the training and from the transplant. Among the 2,000 people expected to attend Monday's funeral were most of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>'s 86 officers, 40 officers from nearby <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and 46 cadets still training at <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. State police had planned to send six cruisers of troopers, but scaled back their plans after <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s family asked that state police not attend the funeral. The family withdrew the request Sunday. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said 50 police departments from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sent their color guards. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed from heat stroke Sept. 19 at the end of the grueling first day of training. Other cadets reported that they were put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of water. Five days before <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> died, Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> released the results of an investigation into the illnesses that found a `` massive failure'' of the system led to abusive training.

 A man was charged Sunday in a hit-and-run death that was widely publicized when a lawyer refused to identify a person who claimed to be the driver of the car. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morser </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> restaurateur, surrendered at the <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and was charged with leaving the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury, a third-degree felony, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Freese </PERSON> of the state attorney's office. <PERSON> Morser </PERSON> was booked and released on his own recognizance in an agreement worked out between the state attorney's office and <PERSON> Morser </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Krischer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, a 28-year-old electrician, died March 9, 1986, when he was struck and dragged 60 feet to his death.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both laid claim Sunday to precious, last-minute momentum in their campaign marathon, the vice president confidently saying the tide was `` moving in our direction'' and his combative rival insisting he was `` rocking and rolling'' to an upset victory. The national polls said it would take a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win on Tuesday. `` There ai n't no stopping us now unless we stop ourselves,'' said the vice president. The political equivalent of a nuclear exchange occurred on television, where the Republicans and Democrats spent millions of dollars in advertising for the waning hours of the campaign. The two candidates bought time for 30-minute commercials on all three major networks for election eve on Monday. Both candidates battled the clock and physical exhaustion in a final drive to snare undecided voters and nail down the presidency. Gallup said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ahead by 12 percentage points and <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today-CNN </ORGANIZATION> said the vice president led by 11. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> made it 10 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> put the margin at nine. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll and another by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> reported a 5-point edge for the vice president and said there was still plenty of room for last minute changes. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> tabulation showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading for 356 electoral votes, although he could not yet count securely on the 270 needed for victory. The tabulation showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading for 101 electoral votes, while 78 were in tossup states including <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. A 50-state poll by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> put 25 states firmly in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s column and another 16 leaning his way, which would provide more than the necessary 270. Only the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was firm for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We ca n't turn the White House over to the people who claim to be on our side but who left the country on its back,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at stops in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Countered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also beginning his day in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>: `` He's slipping and sliding, we're rocking and rolling. He sought to raise fears over the possibility that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ if elected _ might put vice presidential running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> crisis management team. `` Gives you the chills, does n't it?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` Think about it _ the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> missile crisis, with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge.'' Democrats voiced confidence they would retain or perhaps widen their majorities in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in Tuesday's balloting, and they got little dissent from Republicans on that score. One of the tightest <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where a late-hour poll showed a virtual dead heat between Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> and Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> for the seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. Democrats also hoped for modest gains among the 12 statehouse races on the ballot. It was the costliest campaign in American history, and just one piece of it, a series of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ballot initiatives, had a price tag of more than $ 100 million. Both men drew large crowds in the campaign's final days, and drew strength from them. And in the final two days, the presidential candidates thought no more about flying across the country than most voters thought about walking across the street. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> described the vice president's rapidly changing itinerary as a `` Magical Mystery Tour.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> embarked on two days of non-stop campaigning that would carry him from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and then back home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> by election morning. A series of state polls provided a picture of several close races. One poll gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a 17-point lead in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with its 29 electoral votes. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was reported gaining on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the latest survey in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and holding an eight-point lead in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. NBC News and the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said its nationwide survey completed Saturday night showed the vice president with a lead of 48 percent to 43 percent _ an erosion over two weeks ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' rejected complaints that the vice president had run a nasty campaign and said private <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> surveys showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by a bigger margin than reported by the network. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said he believed the number of voters who were wavering was much lower, `` somewhat under 10 percent.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> professed little doubt about the outcome Tuesday. `` Things are moving in our direction,'' he said as he raced Sunday from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a desperate race, noted that both candidates began the day in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` For months <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been following me around on the issues. He discovered education a few months ago, he even discovered the environment a few months ago,'' he said. `` This week he started following me around on my message, telling people he's on your side. Now he's following me around the country. I'll tell you one place he's not going to follow me. He's not following <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and me to 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the vice presidential nominee, flew from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in a final bid to prevent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from taking his home state. In an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> conceded that no matter which candidate won, he would n't have much of a mandate after the election. He also said that if he returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, he would help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he thought it was deserved and try to block him when he thought the president was wrong. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who shows up as a drag on the Republican ticket in virtually all the polls, declined invitations to appear on network television and campaigned Sunday in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, one of the safest Republican states where a new poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 56-25 lead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used his 30-minute campaign-closing commercial to show himself responding to questions from average Americans and to trumpet the populist theme that has adopted in the hope of scoring an upset on Tuesday. `` Look in the mirror and ask yourself,'' he says in a film clip taken from a rally. `` Is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on your side?''

 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> arrived here Sunday to visit with relatives and undergo medical tests on his first visit outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies. Speaking through a translator, the tall, balding physicist and Nobel laureate called himself a free man but said others remain in prison who helped him through his years in internal exile in a Soviet city closed to Westerners. `` Two years ago, I became a free man when I returned from <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Now I have become even freer because I have been granted the right to travel around the world,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told reporters during a brief meeting. `` But a man who staged a one-person demonstration on my behalf in January 1980 when I was exiled to Gorky remains in prison. The name of that man is <PERSON> Vazif </PERSON> <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON> ... and I feel it is my duty now, at this moment, to remember this man and many others who remain in prison.'' <PERSON> Meilanov </PERSON> is a Soviet mathematician. Among the relatives <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> will visit in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area are his stepson <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Alekseyeva </PERSON>, and their 4-year-old daughter <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, whom he never has seen. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> also will participate in the first board meeting outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation was formed in January by Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists and educators to support research on global problems. `` I think that my country ... and your country can do a great deal together for peace and to eliminate hunger and violence,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. He began his remarks by saying that he has a great deal of respect for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which he said is `` indeed a truly great country.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said he has a special feeling for the city of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> `` because it gave shelter to my dear ones.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was accompanied to the news conference by his stepdaughter and her husband, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>. He will stay with the couple in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> during his visit. During his stay he will undergo tests at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a heart condition and possible implantation of a pacemaker. He is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to attend the board meeting of the foundation, which is chaired by <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> on the trip from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, remained in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His two-week trip comes less than two years after he was freed from internal exile stemming from his opposition to the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights activities, told reporters at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Sheremetyevo airport earlier that he was pleased to be going to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, kissed his wife in a diplomatic lounge where they had waited, smiling and holding hands, and then headed for the New York-bound plane. Reporters who went to the airport were not allowed in the lounge but could watch from a distance. On a brief walk from a white Volga sedan to the lounge, he told reporters there still are political prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including an unknown number in mental institutions. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> left using the blue passport of a member of an official delegation, not a red passport of an average Soviet citizen. He was traveling with <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Both men are members of the board of the foundation. The granting of an exit visa to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was a dramatic indication of the changes in Soviet society under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb but in the 1970s became a leader in the Soviet dissident movement. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was exiled to the closed industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in January 1980 for his criticism of the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> the previous month. His wife was banished to <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> as well in August 1984. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> remained there until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called him back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986. Earlier that year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had told a French newspaper <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> could not travel outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because he knew too many state secrets. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has continued his scientific work, and now concentrates on the origins of the universe. He speaks out occasionally on human rights issues. In June, he said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> deserves to be given time and trust in his efforts to reform Soviet society, but in September told reporters he saw signs that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` backtracking'' on some elements of his reforms. The International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity was formed in January by Soviet and American scientists and educators. The group's headquarters is in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but it has offices in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Its board meeting will be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Nov. 13-17.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, battling against the clock to keep his presidential hopes alive, heaped scorn on the Republican ticket Sunday and accused <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` following me around on the issues.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned across the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in an urgent final appeal for votes before Tuesday's election. Aides pointed with enthusiasm to new polls showing him continuing to narrow the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee's lead. `` I can smell victory in the air,' the Democratic nominee told a rally of 10,000 people in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of Westminster within sight of the snow-capped <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` He's slipping and sliding. We're rocking and rolling.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later spoke to a crowd estimated at 10,000 people outdoors at <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where he charged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was following him around the country. `` They're getting so worried <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is following me around _ can you believe it,'' he said. `` We're taking our case to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He's trying to keep <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> away from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' schedule remained in flux as aides tried to figure where to send him in the final hours of the 1988 campaign. He planned to fly from the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> late Sunday evening for <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, then jet back to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for a mid-day event in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A later event was also being planned in an undisclosed site. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was keeping an around-the-clock campaign schedule that would have him flying to events all night Sunday night and Monday night, without stop. Despite unanimity in the polls that he was trailing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at each stop asserted he would win. `` We're going to win here,'' he said in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We're going to win in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. We're going to win in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. We're going to win a victory and a great victory.'' Clearly buoyed by cheering crowds, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been mimicking his own concerns on major issues and had even borrowed his populist `` I'm on your side'' campaign slogan. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been following me around on the issues,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He discovered education a few months ago. ... He's even discovered the environment `` I'll tell you one place he's not going to follow me. He's not following <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and me to 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue.'' Renewing his harsh attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying on a TV interview Saturday that if elected, he might put <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> crisis management group. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it `` could be,'' but that he had n't decided. But if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, it would mean the youthful <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator would be responsible for managing the nation's response to the gravest international incidents. `` Gives you the chills, does n't it? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Think about it _ the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> missile crisis, with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in charge. ... That's a risk we Americans ca n't afford to take,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not a crisis manager, he's a crisis that has to be managed. That's what they've been trying to do since August.'' In <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to a crowd of 7,000 people at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, and took questions from a small group of students afterward. He blasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for what he said was a refusal by the vice president to visit the school when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee heard he would be asked to take questions. `` How can you be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if you do n't want to answer some questions?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advisers were encouraged by an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll released Sunday that showed their candidate had narrowed the gap to five percentage points, with the vice president leading 48 percent to 43 percent. They also said recent polls suggested <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was getting the larger share of voters who were only now making up their minds which candidate they will support. But they were aware that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained well behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in some critical states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> late Saturday night, just as a <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> poll showed him trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 17 percentage points in that state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists also were paying a lot of attention to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where polls have shown <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead and the Republicans investing heavily in the outcome. Campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the candidate is `` moving in most of the battleground states. Many of them are becoming dead heats, and in many of them we're moving ahead.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself, while shaking hands with supporters, put it simply: `` We're surging.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was accompanied on his flight from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> by actress <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. Among the TV actors accompanying him were <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larroquette </PERSON> of the `` Night Court'' program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Republican attacks on the gun control issue were typical of what he called his opponent's campaign of `` distortions and lies.'' In a region where guns are a major issue, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reaffirmed his support for gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen, and by individuals `` subject to state regulation'' for their self-protection. `` This is a law enforcement issue,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't let these lies and distortions stand unanswered in this campaign, and we're not going to.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> late Saturday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced the Republicans for `` big brother tactics'' he said were aimed at intimidating Hispanics into not voting. The Democratic nominee urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to halt GOP ads in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> warning that election officials will be watching polling places to see if non-citizens try to vote.

 Police fired 12 shots at an unarmed prisoner, three of which struck and killed him as he tried to escape while being transferred to another jail, officials said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 28, was killed Saturday night. Maj. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaluso </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> identified the detectives who shot <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> as <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, 29, an employee of the department since 1981, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, 34, who joined in 1983. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who was wearing handcuffs and a knee brace, got out of the detectives' car while it was stopped and started running along a driveway, said Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>. The detectives grabbed their pistols, warned <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> to stop and then started shooting, striking the man several times, <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was about 50 feet from the officers when they fired, he said. `` The reason the officers shot was they feared for their lives,'' <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> said. Witnesses said at least one officer fired at <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> after he had fallen to the ground. `` They did n't have to keep shooting that man,'' said witness <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` Hey man, I'm not going anywhere,'' Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> as saying after he had been shot once in the leg and again in the torso. The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was struck by three bullets, one in the back and two in the chest. Sheriff <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON>, called at home by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Sunday night, said he could not immediately provide details. Chief Deputy <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said department policy allows officers to shoot suspects if they `` feel their lives are in danger or if they are threatened _ that's the policy; it depends on the individual.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the department generally interprets the policy to mean `` when the suspects have weapons.'' The detectives were relieved of duty with pay pending an investigation, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The detectives fired with a .357 Magnum revolver and a 45-caliber automatic, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was in jail on a car theft charge. He was being transferred to the second jail on an outstanding felony escape charge. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> previously had been arrested on two felony and one misdemeanor escape charge. He also was being held in a felony drug case, two misdemeanor theft charges and a resisting arrest case. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> also escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 1, 1985, while serving time for theft, sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendenhall </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Magazine: Oat Bran, Black Market Cacti, Ragged Jeans Were Hot Stuff
In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you feasted on oat bran, fed Fido with gourmet chow, pulled on a pair of pre-shredded jeans or leafed through a comic book this year you were one of the Americans who made those some of the hottest products of 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> Adweek </ORGANIZATION> magazine. The hottest products largely were `` conspicuously unnecessary,'' the advertising and marketing trade magazine stated in this week's issue, and ran the gamut from the ephemeral novelty to technological nuisance Trends in trendy stuff included rapidly growing demand for oats in all forms, especially oat bran, among cholesterol-conscious Americans; <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Rogaine hair-growth treatment, which recently got federal government approval for prescription sales; a new genre of comic books aimed at adult audiences, so-called `` graphic novels''; and slashed jeans, pre-damaged by the maker for that rough-and-tumble look, for $ 50 a pair. The magazine said other hot stuff for 1988 included: _ Upscale pet paraphernalia, including designer dog and cat clothing, gourmet pet food and perfumed groomings; _ Trendy foods like cheese-flabvored popcorn and fancy peppers; _ Black market saguaro cactuses, illegally dug up and replanted as lawn decorations in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>; _ Increased use of Retin A skin wrinkle treatment by younger consumers; _ Disposable extended-wear contact lenses; _ Belt pouches, used by skiers, cyclists and, increasingly, city pedestrians; _ Technological devices such as home fax machines, electronic still cameras that can play back snapshots on the television screen and voice mail corporate telephone answering systems _ Scientific journals; _ Adult literacy programs; _ Computer <PERSON> Adweek </PERSON> also said the year featured a number of retro-trends sparked by nostalgia-fueled baby boomers. Those included Mr. Potato Head toys, <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> motorcycles and accessories, charm bracelets, yo-yos, pink flamingos, convertible cars, seamed stockings and garter belts, and a resurgence in train travel.

<HEAD>Trade Group: U.S. Heating Oil Supplies Adequate, Even For A Cold
Winter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's home heating oil supplies are adequate even if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a very cold winter, according to an analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The Washington-based trade organization said in a report released Monday that based on its analysis of recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> figures, home heating oil demand this winter would range from about 3.24 million to 3.52 million barrels per day. Total supply for the 1988-89 winter season, based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refinery production, net imports and inventory drawdowns, will range from 3.27 million barrels a day to 3.77 million barrels a day, depending on the level of demand, according to API's analysis. The group said those amounts would be `` more than adequate to meet anticipated demand, barring some unforeseen interruption in the supply or transportation system.'' Actual demand will depend on factors such as the weather, oil prices and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth, the group said. For example, a winter that was 10 percent colder than normal would boost demand by 75,000 barrels a day. Demand would be 40,000 barrels a day higher if heating oil prices were about $ 12.50 a barrel, instead of the $ 16.50 a barrel price projected by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and would rise by another 25,000 barrels a day if the economic growth rate was 1 percentage point higher than the 2.25 percent growth projected by the <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Dollar Higher, Share Prices Fall Moderately In Early Tokyo
Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar moved higher against the Japanese yen while share prices fell moderately at the start of trading Monday. The dollar opened at 125.28 yen, up from last Friday's close of 124.63 yen. Dealers said the dollar's firmness reflected lower-than-expected figures in the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monthly jobless rate released last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported last Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in October from 5.4 percent the previous month. Market participants had expected the figure to rise to 5.5 percent. Lower unemployment tends to reflect a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, which is bullish for the dollar. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 93.50-point gainer Saturday, slipped 47.91 points from Saturday's close to 27,998.84 shortly after the market opened.
