<TEXT>
 A magazine reported Monday that a bomb maker for a Palestinian group suspected in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing was freed 15 days after his arrest in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because he works for the country's intelligence service. Stern magazine said <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>, 44, was arrested in October after raids in <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, but was allowed to go free the following month and returned to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, where he was born. `` Five weeks later, a radio bomb of the type that <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> had built in <LOCATION> Neuss </LOCATION> blew up in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' the Hamburg-based publication said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in Tuesday's editions, quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as confirming the report. But a spokesman for the intelligence agency, Bundesnachrichtendienst, or <ORGANIZATION> BND </ORGANIZATION>, denied the report, saying of <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>: `` He has never been an agent for <ORGANIZATION> BND </ORGANIZATION> and he is not one now.'' The spokesman declined to discuss other aspects of the report. He spoke on the condition of not being identified. A spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's office said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was released because investigators could not find enough evidence to hold him. <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> is believed to be the bomb maker for the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. British, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> news reports have mentioned the Syrian-based group as a prime suspect in the bombing of New York-bound Pan Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21. All 259 people on board and 11 on the ground were killed. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said its report was based on information provided by two high-ranking security officials it did not identify. It said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was among 16 suspected Palestinian terrorists arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in October. Police seized large quantities of weapons and explosives in the raids, including a bomb-rigged radio cassette recorder. A similar device is believed by British investigators to have caused the Pan Am explosion. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was responsible for making `` radio bombs for attacks on planes'' for <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>. West German officials say they have no evidence linking <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION> members arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the Pan Am bombing. Only two of the 16 arrested in October remain in custody. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said its report is to appear in Wednesday's editions of the magazine. The publication released the report in advance to other news media on Monday.

 Hundreds of Chinese college students demonstrated around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday in support of the pro-democracy uprising in their homeland, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> protesters said they no longer recognized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government. `` Lots of the students are crying. ... I feel like crying, too. I feel so sad and so angry,'' protest organizer <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> said during a somber rally by about 300 students at the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` In the near future the Chinese -LRB- government -RRB- may win the game, but history tells us that the butchers of democracy are doomed in the end,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> graduate student added. The demonstration came as hundreds of thousands of protesters led by students occupied <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for a third day. A reported ultimatum by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> passed without any sign of a military crackdown. Rallies also were held in <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Thousands turned out for protests in several cities Saturday. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, students have led the largest uprising in the 40-year history of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is host to about 40,000 students from that nation. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sunday, three demonstrators met with consular officials and delivered an open telegram. `` We 10,000 Chinese students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are on the side of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' the telegram said. `` We no longer recognize the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government led by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> as a legal administration in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and we pledge our complete disobedience to such a hostile government towards the whole Chinese nation,'' it said. The telegram called for <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s replacement, and said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army should `` stand on the people's side and refuse to suppress the democratic campaign.'' A woman who answered the telephone at the Chinese consulate said officials had no comment. About 100 people marched for three hours at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, carrying signs with such messages as `` No Crackdown,'' `` No Violence'' and `` We want freedom of speech.'' Students, former students and faculty members from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders to voice their support for democratic reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's important that we realize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> did not achieve its independence alone,'' said <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Chao </PERSON>, an American married to a former Chinese student. `` We got help from the French and other people. It's our responsibility to help others.'' In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, about 50 students from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> rallied in front of the Chinese consulate. A letter calling for an end to martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was handed to <PERSON> Xian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who is in charge of Chinese students in the region. The demonstration followed a rally by about 800 people in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Saturday. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, about 50 Chinese students from <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> carried banners and chanted English and Chinese in a peaceful protest on the Temple campus, officials said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where about 3,500 students demonstrated Saturday, four people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and five Americans held a rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two small fishing boats were caught in the swift current flowing over a spillway into a bayou, leaving at least two people dead and three others presumed drowned Sunday. Police said two men had been fishing from a boat tied to a post near a dam spillway where water from <LOCATION> D'Arbonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> dumps into Bayou D'Arbonne. The lake is unusually high because of recent storms. The men untied the boat to return to shore but their motor would not start and the boat began drifting toward the dam, authorities said. They said the men managed to grab brush about 30 yards from the spillway and people in a second boat threw a line to them. When the men grabbed the rope, both boats were swept into the swift current. The bodies of a man and woman found Saturday were identified Sunday as <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, age unknown, of <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Ruston </LOCATION>.

 Seventy-seven Japanese left by ship for <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> today, becoming the first group of Japanese tourists to visit the Soviet island since the end of World War II, local officials said. <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamamori </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Wakkanai </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northernmost island of Hokkaido, was among the tourists who left the city for <LOCATION> Kholmsk </LOCATION>, a city on southern <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION>, aboard a Soviet ship this morning. `` I hope today's voyage will pave the way for a regular ferry service linking -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with the Soviet island -RRB- ... and which will contribute to promoting exchanges of people, culture and goods,'' <PERSON> Hamamori </PERSON> said in a nationally televised interview before the ship's departure A territorial dispute over a group of islands near <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> seized by the Soviets in the closing days of the World War II has blocked efforts to conclude a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, technically leaving the two nations at war. The Soviet claim to <LOCATION> Sakhalin </LOCATION> is not now disputed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but total recognition is being withheld by the government until the return of the other islands, known in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the `` northern territories.''

But <PERSON> Salyers </PERSON> was unable to bring <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> to the trophy stand to share in the award ceremony.

The rest of the 228 contestants were not as anxious to flout the law of gravity. The average chicken entered the mail-box launching chute, flapped its wings hysterically and settled on the ground a few feet away. <PERSON> Salyers </PERSON> said he had no secret for training flying chickens. `` I do n't mistreat them,'' he said. `` They're pretty wild. I just go out and say, ` Shoo!' That scares them, I guess, and they take off. But there's no training a chicken so you'll know which one will fly and which wo n't.''

 A hard-bound edition of `` Gone With The Wind,'' with signatures of 23 cast and crew members from the legendary MGM film, was sold for $ 20,000 at a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> auction at the Ebell Theater.

The 1938 edition of <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Southern romance novel belonged to actor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlton </PERSON>, one of the twin's vying for <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>'s affection in the movie's opening sequence.

A Civil War coat worn by <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> went for $ 6,000. <PERSON> Vilkin </PERSON> declined to identify the bidders. `` I think movies are a common denominator amongst all of us no matter what we do. We all have great memories,'' <PERSON> Vilkin </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the industry started ... these things are thrown away.

 When Tennessee-based <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> started beaming a news program with commercials into six high schools last winter, educators were outraged. This spring, when <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and the Discovery Channel each promised schools commercial-free cable news and documentary programming, many of those same people applauded. Those reactions left the impression that the presence or absence of Snickers or blue jeans ads was the only concern school officials have about classroom TV programmming. But there are other issues. One is time, `` a school's most precious commodity,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching. Hardly a week passes that some study does n't demand that public schools raise test scores and teach more math, or science, or art, or values, or safe sex _ all of this, presumably, to be shoehorned into the same 180-day school year. The 12-minute-a-day Channel One news show that Whittle offers is the equivalent of six classroom days a year, one of which would be commercials alone. <PERSON> Manya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, and others say that because classroom time is so precious, educators should be sure that TV programs support, rather than supplant, the curriculum. `` If there are ways to provide this technology when, where and how the teacher feels it best enhances instruction, discussion and comprehension, then it is to be applauded,'' <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON> said. `` If it does n't, it's a detriment.'' Few educators outright oppose classroom TV. Nearly two-thirds of all school districts now have some link to cable programming, according to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> survey. But television has inherent shortcomings as an educational technology, many still believe, especially compared to microcomputers. `` Television is not the preferred technology in most instances,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has a cost advantage over film. `` But microcomputers are far more powerful educationally than television because they are individualized and they are interactive. `` Unfortunately,'' he continued, `` the public thinks we are against technology when we say we're not that impressed with television. But in many ways it is outdated. Research shows it is not that effective.'' At least some of these problems can be overcome. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> won praise this school year when it financed the nation's first statewide educational satellite system. Public TV station <ORGANIZATION> KET </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Star Channels'' features hardware that allows students all over the state to communicate with a televised teacher at the touch of a button. The announcement last week of `` Assignment: Discovery,'' to debut Sept. 18, followed <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s announcement that his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> will begin running a 15-minute current events show called `` <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION>'' on Aug. 14. The Discovery Channel's proposed classroom TV offering is getting favorable early notices. Teachers would be free to tape Discovery programs and use them when and however they see fit. Discovery Channel's forte is documentaries, and school officials said they were excited at the prospect of supplementing lessons with clips that would bring history alive in the classroom as no textbook could. `` In a social studies class, I can imagine a teacher saying, ` I want you to watch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> give his ` Ich Bein <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON>' speech,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> The group has blasted Whittle's commercial Channel One, but has praised Discovery Channel. But the debate over classroom commercials masks another fundamental issue: the decadeslong failure of government and educational systems to harness technology to enhance student achievement. In effect, commercial broadcasters like <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> are being blamed for stepping into that void and wanting to make a profit. And the school officials pointing accusing fingers at <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> for his commercials are the very ones who have largely escaped blame for doing little about the technology void that private entrepreneurs now seek to fill. `` I think it's a scandal that we're so far into these technologies and yet they remain so unconnected with schools,'' said <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>. `` Education is still standing in the wings, lamenting its abuses.''

<HEAD>Poll: Americans Favor Broad Measures to Curb Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans would accept an array of encroachments on their lives to help clean up the environment, such as a ban on aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling, a poll has found. The Media General-Associated Press survey of 1,084 adults found broad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise, and that government, businesses and average Americans are not doing enough to combat it. Three-quarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are too weak, and majorities favored urgent government action, no matter what the cost, to protect the nation's drinking water Large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all major oil facilities and at oil - and coal-burning power plants, even if those measures would raise the price of oil, gasoline and electricity Environmental concerns were heightened by the nearly 11 million gallons of oil spilled by the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in March. But the poll, conducted by telephone May 5-13, found concerns went beyond the issue of oil tanker safety. The highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal, in which 63 percent supported urgent action by the government regardless of the expense. Next was the related issue of the pollution of drinking water, with 52 percent favoring urgent action, cost aside. On the issue of household waste, 20 percent said their communities now require them to separate and recycle glass, cans and paper refuse. Of the rest, an overwhelming 87 percent said they would support such a requirement. Respondents also favored new steps against air pollution. Seventy-five percent backed a ban on household aerosol products; 60 percent supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid; and 58 percent favored a ban on non-radial tires, which release more rubber into the air than do radials. Those proposals are among the steps suggested for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by a regional air quality board in March. Other measures in that plan won less support nationally: Respondents were split on parking restrictions in cities to discourage driving, and 59 percent opposed banning gasoline-fueled garden appliances. Still, 72 percent supported strict pollution controls on oil-and coal-burning power plants, even if that would raise the price of power. Smokestack controls are another feature of the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan. In an issue related to the Exxon Valdez disaster, 81 percent said new safety rules and emergency cleanup teams should be in place at all major oil facilities, even if that raised the price of oil and gasoline. Responses were less certain on whether the federal government should issue new drilling permits. Forty-five percent opposed new drilling off the coasts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while about 35 percent favored new drilling there and 20 percent were unsure. Opposition was greater to oil drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, which also is being considered. Sixty percent were opposed and only about a quarter were in favor, with the rest unsure. Overall, 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased during the past decade. And in a measure of its personal impact, nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the beach last year because of beach pollution. Concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political lines. Residents of the nation's most densely populated areas were the most apt to see anti-pollution efforts as inadequate and to favor new steps. Respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around for the nation's pollution problems. Forty-two percent said businesses are doing a poor job of keeping the environment clean and 36 percent said `` only fair.'' Similarly, 83 percent rated the federal government's environmental record as only fair or poor, as opposed to good or excellent; 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and local governments' environmental records; and 79 percent said most Americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the environment clean The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three months after the last Soviet soldiers left, the government is showing increasing confidence it can ultimately force Moslem guerrillas and their supporters _ especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ to talk peace. After initial anxiety following the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal and the guerrillas' <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> offensive, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is displaying a new optimism in its ability to stand alone against the mujahedeen guerrillas. Western countries had predicted the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, would overwhelm the Afghan armed forces within weeks or at least a few months of the Soviets' departure on Feb. 15. Although these predictions have not come true, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rebuffed proposals by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a mutual cut-off of weapons and stepped-up efforts for a cease-fire. `` They say, ` We should give the mujahedeen more time,' but they have had time and they have nothing to show. They have no power. They can only fire rockets,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said. He said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should accept that the guerrillas will not bring down the Soviet-backed government and that a negotiated peace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The guerrilla attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> claims was orchestrated by neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s top military and civilian officials, was based on the assumption that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city would fall quickly, clearing the way for a push on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> But government forces defending <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> have proved their morale was not sapped by the Soviet withdrawal. And the mujahedeen have not yet shown themselves capable of transforming from hit-and-run fighters to a cohesive force able to mount a conventional assault on a heavily defended city. The guerrillas' failure to capture <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and other major cities appears to have strengthened feelings among government troops that the war has become a do-or-die affair. `` As long as the Russians were here, there was confusion among the people about what we were fighting for,'' a 30-year-old soldier in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> said recently. `` Now we know. We are fighting as Afghans, and the fighting is for our future.'' After failing for nine years to win the war with 115,000 soldiers and a mighty modern arsenal, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> now professes a desire to play peacemaker. It has called for a broad-based government in which <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-style party would play a role _ but not the only role. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador, predicted the military stalemate and increasing diplomatic pressure will oblige the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to begin talks on ending the bloodshed. More than 1.3 million Afghans _ nearly one-tenth of the country's pre-war population of 15 million _ have been killed. Another 5 million have fled across the borders to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` By the end of summer, I think there will be a change of mind, a change of this policy of ` give war a chance,' `` <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. Many foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, including from nations friendly to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, also said they believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will feel increasing pressure for a settlement. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> already has promised <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> it will halt arms supplies to the guerrillas when current contracts expire, Chinese and Soviet diplomats said on condition of anonymity. And on Sunday, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> offered a dozen guerrilla field commanders full autonomy in their regions if they stop fighting the government and help end the 11-year-old civil war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, anxious to repatriate its 2 million Afghan refugees, also appears to be shifting toward a negotiated peace. That leaves only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ the guerrillas' other major backers _ committed to ending the fighting A diplomat from a non-communist, pro-Western nation said: `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has proven he is tough, organized and that he wo n't run. The longer the Western countries try to ignore him, the stronger they're going to allow him to become. In two or three months' time, he could well be a hero.'' A common preference for a settlement seems to rest with an ill-defined compromise: a government that is neither as ruthless as the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> has been since it seized power in 1978, nor as committed to Islamic fundamentalism as some of the most powerful guerrilla groups are. Events of the last decade have provided little nourishment for middle-of-the-road politics and seem to leave the task of finding a compromise up to those on the outside, such as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or the superpowers.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Proxmire Still Moving Fast After Senate Career</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The platform of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> subway station is crowded and former Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> is striding so rapidly through the cavernous space that he could almost be said to be running. Flashing lights and a far-away rumble signal the approach of a train. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> is out of position. He moves from a rapid walk to a dash, darting inside a car just before the doors close with an automated whoosh. It's not an isolated event. It's a routine. `` I pace up and down carrying a heavy brief case,'' the 73-year-old <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat says. `` I do a sprint right at the very end.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> was once the country's most celebrated long-distance amateur runner. For decades he ran flat out _ `` I never jogged'' _ the five miles between his home in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> park in <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office on Capitol Hill. `` I ca n't do that anymore,'' he says. `` I've got a bum knee.'' So he exercises, rides his stationary bike, and strides the length of lengthy subway platforms. `` One great heart specialist says the secret is that you've got to keep moving, got to keep moving,'' the former senator says. On this particular day, like most days, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> goes to work in a tiny cubicle attached to the <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFollette </PERSON> Sr, <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The room has a special significance for him. He held <PERSON> LaFollette </PERSON>'s seat in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for 31 years, ever since he won a special election to replace the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in 1957. The cubicle is equipped with a chair, bookshelves, a telephone and typewriter. It is not equipped with a view. A computer terminal is expected soon. Not much room, not much equipment, for a man who until last December commanded a large office suite in the <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Office Building and a personal and committee staff of dozens. `` When you're in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> you really get support,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> says. `` I loved the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but I do n't very much miss it.'' `` What I do miss is the clerical staff, the secretarial support, the schedulers, the researchers.'' In retirement, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> is pretty much of a one-man band, with an occasional boost now and then from former staff members. He does his own typing. And he is gingerly returning to what he calls `` my first love, journalism.'' An early job, in 1949, was as a reporter with the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. He was fired after a series of run-ins with management. But now he's back. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> is launching a twice-a-week newspaper column under the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Features </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>. He says that one of the 40 or 50 subscribers signed up so far is The Capitol Times. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> launched his column last week with a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in which he resurrected his Golden Fleece Award, perhaps the most successful political public relations device of its era. The Fleece will be a monthly feature of the Proxmire column, carrying on a tradition that, beginning in March 1975, continued for 165 consecutive months with citations for what <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> considered examples of conspicuous government waste, and an occasional award of merit for a positive action that saved money or spent it well. `` Just because I'm out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does n't mean we have to abandon a device that does something to cut down spending in this time of fearful budget deficits,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> also is planning a book. Subject: debt, government debt, business debt, household debt. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been predicting a sharp recession for years: `` I think when the recession comes it's likely to be a real killer, a depression _ and that is because our debt is so enormous.'' He has been working up to the book by using debt as the theme of dozens of speeches around the country. At the press club news conference, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> was asked if he, as a former <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, had ever considered giving himself a Golden Fleece for failing to spot and stop the pattern of abuses that grew into the multibillion-dollar savings and loan scandal. There were so many mistakes by so many people `` that you'd have to have a barrel of fleeces, including one for the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' he replied. `` I'll let other people give me a fleece, rather than commit suicide,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Wright Says Rules Were Changed on Him in Mid-Game</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s televised defense against ethics charges this week will be that the rules were changed in mid-stream, but even his own lawyers give him less than an even chance of winning quick dismissal of the case. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets of charges brought against their client by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee should be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moral climate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent. `` We are hoping for a clear interpretation that the rules have n't changed on us,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied and give the speaker less than even chance of winning a pre-emptive dismissal of the charges. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers, said last week that in a best-case scenario, the odds of succeeding with such a motion would be 50-50; in this case, he conceded that the odds could be something less than that. And a growing number of House Democrats are saying that while the ethics process is important, it may ultimately prove irrelevant to the speaker's political fortunes. `` It would be nice if he could be in a position to defend his case on the merits before he has to face the question of what the political consequences are,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., who has argued that the rules are on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s side <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a hard-nosed trial lawyer brought in this month to bolster the defense team, is expected to argue that the committee misapplied the rules in two ways: _ In charging <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with evading limits on outside earned income through bulk sales of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' the panel ignored a rule specifically exempting book royalties from the limit House rules place a cap on money earned from speaking fees at 30 percent of congressional salary. The ethics panel said that in seven instances, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sold bulk quantities of books to groups he had spoken to, and that the sales were really disguised speaking fees which he otherwise would n't have been able to accept. `` No rule of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, no advisory opinion, no prior cases and not one shred of legislative history ... supports the outside special counsel's revisionist approach to the copyright royalty exemption,'' the lawyers argue in a statement. _ Charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly accepted $ 145,000 in improper gifts from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate developer and business partner of the speaker, are based on a finding that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Over a period of nearly 10 years, <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, use of a car and a condominium in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, and from 1979 through 1984 paid Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> an $ 18,000-a-year salary. The committee found reason to believe those amounted to gifts, and that <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> had a stake in legislation because of his many investments. House rules bar acceptance of more than $ 100 in gifts annually from any such person. An ethics committee advisory opinion defines the direct interest standard as `` a distinct or special interest in influencing or affecting the federal legislative process which sets the individual or organization apart from the general public.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the ethics committee's special outside counsel in the case, will defend the panel's rules interpretation at the hearing Tuesday. The dismissal motion essentially asks the ethics committee to abandon rules interpretations it earlier had decided to accept. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., last week characterized the panel's original decision as `` very well founded. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense team is not challenging, at least for the moment, charges that he failed to report the <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> benefits as gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms, a relatively minor concern. Following the hearing, expected to take about six hours, the committee will meet later in the week to rule on the dismissal motion. Any remaining charges then would become the subject of a disciplinary hearing. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his advisers, hoping to avoid prolonging what has become a daily barrage of negative news stories and new allegations, are expected to ask that the committee begin the trial-like hearing immediately. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> has said the hearing would probably take more than a week. The panel then would rule on whether the charges have been proved with clear and convincing evidence, and could recommend sanctions to the full House. The House is free to accept, reject or modify the recommendation, but many lawmakers say it is most likely that the chamber would simply accept whatever the ethics panel suggests.

<TEXT>
 A new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis shows that farmers and ranchers with cow-calf operations, the foundation herds that form the bedrock of the nation's beef business, will probably make money again this year. But the detailed figures by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> include some sour notes regarding capital improvements that could affect the long-term financial health of the cattle industry. The analysis also includes some mixed outlook figures for hog producers, who saw market prices drop sharply last year. Even sheep producers are feeling a pinch. If only cash flow is considered, the cow-calf operators are in pretty good shape, economists <PERSON> Hosein </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakpouri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said in their report. But when costs of capital replacement are included, the situation is much less encouraging. The report compares estimated 1988 production costs and net returns with those projected for 1989. Last year's drought `` severely affected'' all livestock producers, the report said. Spending on feed jumped 28 percent from 1987, while gross cash receipts from livestock sales increased only 3 percent. On the average, the `` gross value of production'' of one beef cow totaled $ 348.18 in 1988. That was up from $ 313.70 in 1987. The projection for 1989 is $ 346.06 per cow. The values were construed by including allowances for calves and culled cows, and converting them to a one-cow figure. Cash expenses, ranging from feed to taxes, insurance and interest, also were prorated on a one-cow basis. Those added up to $ 296.77 last year, up from $ 255.84 in 1987. The projection for 1989 is $ 306.26 per cow. Thus, after deducting cash expenses from gross values, the cow-calf operator this year may have an average cash return of $ 39.80 per cow, down from $ 50.46 in 1988 and $ 57.86 in 1987, the report showed. But if an allowance for capital replacement of buildings, equipment and other facilities is included, the tidy per-cow net `` profit'' disappears. In this case, the report said, the operator could lose an average of $ 41.79 per cow in 1989, compared with losses of $ 26.69 in 1988 and $ 17.72 in 1987. `` Cash returns, before and after a charge for the replacement capital, are key indicators of producer supply response,'' the report said. `` A positive cash return is an incentive for producers to continue or even expand their operation; a negative cash return is often regarded as a signal to discontinue production.'' However, the report added, the figures are averages, and there are producers who fare better or worse. Some individual operators may expand when most do not. Also, they can make substitutions in production items in different proportions than allowed in the analysis. The cash return, or residual, reflects the cash flow available for paying family living expenses, repaying debts and replacing machinery, equipment and buildings. `` In the short-term, producers may defer machinery and equipment purchases or repairs if the farm is producing little income or is in an unfavorable tax position,'' the report said. `` But over the long run, operators must replace and maintain the buildings and equipment typically used in the operation.'' The report said the projected decline in net returns to cow-calf operators this year is `` due primarily to higher wintering expenses.'' Higher feed costs and a small increase in the market price of fed beef `` would lower the price cattle feeders can pay for feeder cattle'' in 1989, which will help depress cow-calf returns. Looking at the hog situation, the report said farrow-to-finish operators, who account for about 80 percent of the slaughter hogs produced, saw 1988 gross value of production drop to an equivalent of $ 42.87 per 100 pounds from $ 51.30 per hundredweight in 1987. This year's value was projected at $ 41.23. Cash expenses, meanwhile, jumped to $ 41.64 per hundredweight in 1988 from $ 34.07 in 1987. This year cash expenses were projected at an equivalent of $ 44.44 per hundredweight. Consequently, last year's cash return to farrow-to-finish operators averaged $ 1.23 per hundredweight, down from $ 17.23 in 1987. This year, hog farmers are expected to lose $ 3.21 per hundredweight. After allowing for capital replacement, hog producers lost $ 5.89 per hundredweight in 1988, compared with a profit of $ 10.34 in 1987. This year's loss was shown at $ 10.64 per hundredweight. `` Sheep production has consistently been one of the most profitable livestock enterprises in the past 18 years,'' the report said. `` Nevertheless, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sheep producers experienced a sharp decline in their cash returns in 1988 as sheep production increased. Higher feed costs, as well as lower lamb prices eroded their financial positions.'' The average value of sheep production 1988 was reported at $ 65.56 per ewe in 1988, down from $ 73.05 in 1987. The value for 1989 was projected at $ 63.98 per ewe. Cash expenses were $ 46.38 in 1988, $ 44.66 in 1987 and projected at $ 47.67 in 1989. As a result, net cash returns averaged $ 19.18 per ewe in 1988, compared with $ 28.39 in 1987 and a 1989 return projected at $ 16.31. With allowances for capital replacement, sheep producers were shown at a profit of $ 11.12 per ewe in 1988 and $ 20.60 in 1987. The projection for 1989 was $ 7.90 per ewe.

 Last September, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> thought <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was a blob on the eastern tip of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last week, the 12-year-old could draw a map of the world _ from memory. For more than a decade, <ORGANIZATION> Shady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been sending seventh-grade geography whizzes into a society where, according to a recent Gallup Poll, one in seven Americans ca n't find the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a map of the world. `` You ca n't get anywhere underestimating the ability of a seventh-grader,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They can accomplish enormous things if you set them a task they can break into manageable pieces.'' Without consulting an atlas, this spring's crop of pupils has already outlined the continents with startling accuracy. On <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s map, the sinuous curve of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, the Scandinavian hump, even the six states of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were correctly proportioned on a Mercator grid. Now she is filling in countries, cities, mountains, and rivers, even adding the names of Soviet republics. At 12, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> is trying to remember facts that would stump most college pupils: whether <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> is the capital of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and whether to put it on the island's north or south. `` The hardest part is <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, and all the little islands on the top of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' she said. At the beginning of the school year, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> hands his pupils a blank sheet of paper and asks them to draw everything they know about the world. Most of the sheets are returned with little more than vague circles and squiggles. The problem is n't limited to younger students. A 1988 Gallup Poll commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> found Americans ages 18 to 24 knew less about the world than their counterparts in nine countries. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> keeps those embarrassing first efforts so pupils can proudly compare them to their memory maps at year's end. He teaches geography at the approximate rate of a continent every two weeks. At the end of the year, students spend six weeks making practice maps and three weeks creating their memory maps. Some children who rarely speak in class produce maps so beautiful that their parents frame them, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Though Shady <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> is a private school, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> thinks his teaching method would work elsewhere if educators allot the subject enough time. `` It's important that they know about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s place in the world,'' he said. `` But what's really important is that it's a nine-month project in an age of instant gratification. They leave here with a sense of what they're capable of.''

 Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was charged April 17 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee with 69 instances of violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, and new allegations have since arisen in news reports. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denies having committed ethical violations. Here is a rundown on the charges: BOOK SALES _ The ethics committee charged that on seven occasions, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sold bulk quantities of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' to groups to which he had given speeches. The panel contends that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly disguised speaking fees, which are limited under the rules, as royalties, which are not. LEGISLATIVE INTEREST _ The committee charged that <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, by virtue of his extensive financial holdings, had a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That would make benefits <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife received from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> from 1979 to 1988, totaling $ 145,000, improper under the rules. GIFT REPORTING _ The committee charged that the benefits, including Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s $ 18,000-a-year salary from 1979 through 1984, and use of a 1979 Cadillac and a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium, were not reported as gifts on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s annual financial disclosure form, as required. <LOCATION> SABINE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> LAKE </LOCATION> _ Ethics investigators are still looking into whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received improper proceeds from a 1988 investment in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas drilling venture. Known as the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospect </LOCATION>, the venture yielded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust a quick $ 170,000 profit, even though the well has so far proven dry. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> businessman who arranged the investment, is seeking to sell training aircraft to the Pentagon. <ORGANIZATION> JEWELL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ENTERPRISES </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> borrowed $ 100,000 to invest in a now-defunct business that bought and sold nursing homes. Although he ultimately lost his money, at one point he reportedly received $ 23,000 in dividends unavailable to other investors, and got help paying the interest on his loan. The ethics panel still is examining the transactions. <LOCATION> PACIFIC </LOCATION> <LOCATION> INSTITUTE </LOCATION> _ Former employees of a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, firm that sells motivational programs say <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> did little or no work for the $ 36,000 salary she received from 1985 to 1988. Her boss at the time insists she performed satisfactorily. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used the Congressional Record to print a glowing endorsement of a videotape his wife had helped produce for the firm. The ethics panel is believed to be taking a look at these events, as well.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the dispute over short-range nuclear weapons that has split <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could be resolved before next week's 40th-anniversary meeting of the alliance. `` I think great progress has been made'' in efforts to reconcile U.S.-West German differences over possible negotiations on the missiles, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday during a joint news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` I think that we could well have this resolved before the summit,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Still, the dispute remains a `` vexing question'' and `` there are strong-willed people from strong countries, and they each have an opinion,'' he said after he and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> gave back-to-back commencement speeches at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` One way to guarantee there will not be progress is to lock each other in, in public statements,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, after first opposing <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s suggestions for early U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing short-range missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has sent a counterproposal to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreeing to accept such talks in principle in the future, according to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> first wants to see the Soviets reduce their conventional-force edge, a position <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated Sunday. In his commencement address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` though hope is now running high for a more peaceful continent, the history of this century teaches Americans and Europeans to remain prepared.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who has generally agreed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position, said his role was not that of a mediator between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the issue. `` Obviously, I'd be happy if views can be reconciled and I believe, I think, that they can be reconciled,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, in response to a question, refused to agree with a statement last week by White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> that Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was acting in a `` drugstore cowboy fashion'' in making a succession of arms-control proposals. `` I think that one must be wary of caricatures. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is worth very much more than that,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. In his own commencement speech, delivered in French and translated in segments to an estimated audience of 31,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for their combined efforts to reduce the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> also called for all nations to join in framing `` an emergency plan to save the environment. ... The death of the environment is our death,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at the news conference, said: `` I heard his clarion call for cooperative action on the environment, and I salute him for that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had entertained <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> at his oceanside vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, for the weekend. After the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> appearances, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bade the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leader farewell at a military departure ceremony at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> boarded his <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> supersonic Concorde for the return trip to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then traveled to <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, where he visited his ailing 87-year-old mother, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for about an hour and a half. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is recovering from a mild stroke. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday evening. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with his vanquished 1988 Democratic presidential challenger, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The two shook hands at a pre-commencement reception. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, applauded vigorously by the hometown audience when he was introduced later in the stadium, also shared the dais with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the commencement ceremonies. In his commencement speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sharply critical of recent comments by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that the Soviets' `` commitment to destroy SS-23 missiles under the -LRB- 1987 treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons -RRB- may be reversible.'' `` The Soviets must surely know the results of failure to comply with this solemn agreement. Perhaps their purpose was to divide the West on other issues. Regardless, it is clear that Soviet ` new thinking' has not yet totally overcome the old,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> made the comments in response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to upgrade and extend the range of the American-built Lance short-range missiles, which are not covered by the treaty on intermediate-range missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has consulted with the government of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to come up with an agreement with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that would avoid a clash over the short-range missile flap at the May 29-30 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has strongly opposed East-West talks on cutting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear battlefield weapons at this time.

<HEAD>Boston Cardinal Urges Students to Skip AIDS Classes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic cardinal said an AIDS education program in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> public schools will increase students' risk of getting the disease, and has urged parents not to allow their children to participate. In a letter read at weekend Masses in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> parishes, Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> said the lessons planned for students in seventh throught 12th grades over the next six weeks `` could place our children in danger, both moral and physical.'' `` The curriculum presents various issues of sexual behavior in a valueless, amoral context,'' Law wrote. `` It admits a permissiveness in sexual behavior which is not acceptable to a great many citizens of the city, is certainly unacceptable for Catholics and which increases the children's risk of gettting AIDS.'' The schools plan to offer two 45-minute lessons stressing abstinence and shunning intravenous drug use as the best way to prevent AIDS. Instructors will tell students who are sexually active to use condoms. Parents who object may exempt their children from the classes. Law warned that `` students as young as 13 will ... be given explicit instructions in the use of condoms. Sexual abstinence can not be taught if at the same time detailed directions on how to use condoms are presented as an alternative.'' He said the archdiocese will offer its own `` value-centered'' AIDS education program this summer. Some school leaders disagreed with Law's evaluation of the program. `` It is fine for him to take moral positions, but young people have not abstained from sexual activity,'' said School Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` That's the reality we deal with in the public schools.'' `` They are not all Catholic, but Protestants, Jewish, Buddhists,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, a school committee member. `` They have a right to know how to protect themselves from any sexually transmitted disease.'' A Protestant leader, the Rev. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.M.E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said that like <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, he was concerned that `` parts of the curriculum send a mixed message to young people.'' `` But the cardinal's position fails to take into consideration the fact that the problem already exists,'' he added. Two years ago, a plan for pilot school health clinics that could have prescribed birth control devices was derailed by political and religious foes.

<HEAD>Martha's Vineyard Residents Don't Know What's Worse: Tourists or
Skunks.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It's springtime on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard and the locals are girding for what's become an annual influx of arrogant, offensive pests who walk the streets at night and hang out at restaurants. It's not tourists. It's skunks. Hordes of the `` black cats with white tails'' have inhabited the island, taking up residence under houses, rummaging through restaurant garbage, intimidating vacationers, terrorizing pets and, frankly, stinking up the place. `` They're really bold and brassy. You can see them on the main streets, you can see them walking around anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON>, animal control officer for the Vineyard Haven section of town. `` If you're fishing at night, they'll just come right up to you.'' Dead fish along the shore, ground nesting birds and plenty of woods make the island an ideal habitat for skunks. And state wildlife officials and animal control officers in the island's six towns say their telephones do n't stop ringing in the springtime when baby skunks are born and the warm weather makes the beasts more active. <PERSON> Fin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was the man many residents hired from 1982 until his retirement in 1987 to rid their property of the raccoons, skunks and feral cats that were giving them headaches. During that five-year period, he said, he trapped nearly 500 skunks. Another trapper was said to have caught about 300 a year during the period. `` I found they're partial to <ORGANIZATION> Devil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dogs </ORGANIZATION> and Twinkies. People used to call it junk food but I used to call it skunk food,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I could catch a skunk on any place, except the Presbyterian church steeple. They have n't gotten up there yet.'' Many islanders swear that, at least since Colonial times, no skunks were on the island before the late 1950s. How they returned to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard is a touchy matter involving old allegations that have flourished into local lore. Legend has it that the skunk population was revived when Vineyard Haven native <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON> brought two unscented skunks _ one male and one female _ and set them free to roam with the oxen, cattle and goats on his farm some 30 years ago. <PERSON> Kingsbury </PERSON>, 77, swears it's not true. He blames vacationers for bringing baby skunks and raccoons over as pets and abandoning them on the island when the cuddly critters got big and nasty. The old farmer said he was accused by his neighbors because a family of abandoned skunks took up residence on his property. `` The skunks moved in on my farm and I did n't bother them, kill them, or have a fit over them. I just left them alone,'' he said, and laughed at the typical city vacationer's fear of wildlife. `` Anything bigger than a field mouse puts them in a trauma.'' But the rumors persist. `` For some reason there's always a dead skunk in front of his house. If you do n't see them, you can smell them,'' <PERSON> Goodale </PERSON> said. The 100-square-mile island has few predators to control the skunk population. `` They only have one natural enemy, and that has four wheels,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazlauskas </PERSON>, operations manager of the island's trash disposal agency. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said the problem is really part-skunk and part-people. She said if residents could learn to cap their garbage, close up basement windows and not bother the skunks people could coexist with the mammals. Wildlife workers occasionally are called to come to the aid of a skunk found stumbling along with a head trapped in a yogurt container or jelly jar. But more often, they get complaints. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' favorite comes from people who call to say their dog was sprayed while he was out running around the neighborhood. `` They violate the leash law, their dog gets sprayed, and they want me to kill the skunk,'' she said.

 `` We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and clearly, we support democracy. I do n't want to be gratuitous in giving advice, but I would encourage restraint. I do not want to see bloodshed. We revere the model of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in this country for his peaceful protest, and so I might suggest a familiarization with that for the people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and I would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible in order to see more democratization and to see a peaceful resolution of this matter. `` We have been in touch with our ambassador on this very key question. I think this perhaps is a time for caution, because we aspire to see the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people have democracy, but we do not exhort in a way that is going to stir up a military confrontation. We do not want to have a situation like happened in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, or some other place. And so, as we counsel restraint, and as we counsel peaceful means of effecting change, that is sound advice. And I think to go beyond that and encourage steps that could lead to bloodshed would be inappropriate. `` I do n't think that it would be appropriate for the President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to say to the demonstrators and the students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> exactly what their course of action should be. That is for them to determine. They know the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' commitment to democracy, to the commitment to freedom, to the aspiration we have that all people will live in democratic societies. But I'm not about to suggest what I think they ought to do except to spell out: peaceful, and continue to fight for what you believe in, stand up for what you believe in, but ... beyond that, I can not go. `` There's certainly an enormous expression on the part of many people -- students and others -- for change, for movement toward democracy. I lived there. I saw a society totally different than the one that exists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has moved in some areas towards democracy. Now, the quest is, and the appeal from these kids, is to move further ... But I am not going to dictate, or try to say from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, how this matter should be resolved by these students. I'm not going to do it.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sister injured three police officers in a minor car accident en route to hear her brother speak at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s commencement. The officers had been directing <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> to a parking area Sunday morning near the campus where 30,000 graduates and their families were gathering to hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> deliver the keynote addresses. Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> stopped to talk to the officers after she encountered a roadblock. She put the car in reverse and the car suddenly lurched backward and struck the officers, police said. `` One officer was hit in the knee with the car's fender, another was hit by the door as it flung open, and a third was swept back about 10 feet by the door itself,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, a police spokeswoman. Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> sedan then bashed into a police truck stationed at the roadblock, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> said. Two of the officers sustained minor cuts and bruises and the one who was swept back 10 feet sustained minor head and neck injuries, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. All three men were treated at a hospital and released. Investigating officers reported there was no apparent negligence on the part of Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and no charges were filed, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> said. `` All's well that ends well, so to speak,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> did not answer a message left on the telephone answering machine at her suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> home.

 They may have been just yards from two world leaders, but many graduating seniors were less than awestruck during <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 116th commencement. The presence of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> at Sunday's graduation caused a mixed reaction among the roughly 5,400 graduates. `` We had to throw away the champagne bottles,'' said graduating senior <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, 21, who received a degree in political science. `` But I guess it is worth the trade-off if it means having the president here.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON>, 22, a graduating senior from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said some in her class thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> would overshadow them. `` Some of the people fear it takes away from us,'' <PERSON> Hansel </PERSON> said. `` But mostly it is exciting. Most people ca n't believe we are here.'' But if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation, many of the more than 30,000 alumni, friends and relatives in the packed audience were thrilled. Some, like <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, 72, a member of the class of 1939, came from <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, for the ceremony. `` It's great _ really exciting,'' said <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>, sitting with other members of the 50th reunion class on <LOCATION> Nickerson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which was festooned with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flags. `` It's a lot different from 50 years ago. -LRB- Republican presidential candidate -RRB- <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> was our speaker then.'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Anbar </PERSON>, 23, a graduating senior, said his parents traveled from the small <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> when they heard that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> were the featured speakers. `` It was a good reason for my parents to come,'' said <LOCATION> Anbar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, and their wives, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, were welcomed with applause and cheers. The heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been under siege since his failed presidential campaign for the state's fiscal crisis. Some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the words, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Knew'' on their mortar boards. A few held up protest signs when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his address. `` I'm wearing this because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew about the Contras but went ahead and made <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> the scapegoat,'' said <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, 22, a graduating senior from south <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It's an imperialist presidency and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should n't be here.'' Another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the stadium, protesting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policies. But most of the students, a number of them holding tiny <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, said they were pleased with the commencement. They often interrupted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s speech, cheering the French president's exhortations for a better environment when he said, `` The earth is our planet, let us save it.'' <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, who will be attending law school, said most students were glad <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the graduation. `` We're all pretty bourgeois,'' he said.

 Up to 40,000 people in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> rallied to demonstrate their hope the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will overturn the 1973 decision that legalized abortions, and more than 100 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, about 4,000 people sang and prayed, carrying balloons and placards during an anti-abortion rally in the city's Market Square The protesters paraded through the downtown shopping area in a light rain Saturday during the 10th Annual Greater Pittsburgh March for Life. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> demonstrators gathered at <LOCATION> Kiener </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> on Sunday without incident and no arrests were made, said police Lt. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. But several police officers at the scene and pro-choice supporters disagreed with the official crowd estimate. They said only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were on hand. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, 119 protesters were arrested Saturday outside of two abortion clinics. They were charged with aggravated disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and criminal trespassing. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the protesters, said his clients planned to plead innocent to all charges today in <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> demonstrators marched several blocks through downtown, some holding balloons and banners. One teen-age girl carried a sign saying, `` Thanks, Mom!'' The `` Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case that could be used to overturn the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized the procedure in 1973. The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in that case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use of public funds. <PERSON> Loretto </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> said rally organizers hoped to impress the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with the number of people who attended the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> event. During the rally, about 85 pro-choice supporters stood across from <LOCATION> Kiener </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>. One woman carried a giant white coat hanger with the messages `` Never again'' and `` Keep abortion safe and legal.'' `` We just wanted to be a thorn in their side, to keep them honest,'' said <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, a board member of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.

 American troops face a greater threat of becoming involved in war because of guerrilla insurgencies in such places as <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> than from tensions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> specialist says. `` That's the real threat. It's the real war,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for defense for low-intensity conflict, said in a recent interview. `` But it's very difficult to go to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public and convince them that a country that has a population less than <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, is a threat to national security.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> and others say <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> strategy for the past 40 years has focused on possible confrontation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, leading in turn to an emphasis on massive troop deployments and expensive, hi-tech weapons. They say the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to concentrate more on guerrilla wars left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ill-prepared to deal with such low-intensity conflicts, which <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> says can pose `` a threat to our economic interests, a threat to political values, a threat to the survival of our friends and allies.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, noting the importance of the issue, in 1986 mandated a special office to coordinate low-intensity conflict and special operations. It called for a new command, an added assistant secretary of defense and a special board within the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Since then, legislators have given high marks to the military for moving ahead with the special operations command, which unites the elite units of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But they point to foot-dragging surrounding low-intensity conflict policy. `` Three problems are most glaring: the lack of interest in low-intensity conflict which is most pronounced in non-defense activities, major conceptual shortcomings, and the lack of interagency coordination,'' four of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proponents of the legislation said in a Jan. 25 letter to Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security director. `` Unfortunately, opposition within the Executive Branch has blocked meaningful implementation of these important reforms,'' the letter signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said `` institutional opposition'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> delayed the appointment of an assistant secretary of defense. Former Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON> assumed the office in June 1988 but already is stepping down due to the change in administrations. Military and legislative sources said the leading candidate is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, and that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has sent <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>'s name to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for approval. `` He's the only man for the job,'' retired Army Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Locher </PERSON>. `` Of all the possible men who could make the cut, <PERSON> Locher </PERSON> is the one.'' <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> was <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s predecessor as <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy specialist for low-intensity conflict from May 1987 to October 1987. He said he quit because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` did n't want an activist guy'' and few policy makers understand what guerrilla wars involve. `` In a very short time we get fed up,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` It's not what the professional warrior class wants to do. That's why we're no good at it.'' Army Col. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in a position paper about low-intensity conflict last year, said it is `` total war'' and described it as `` an armed conflict in a Third World country that affects national security interests _ a conflict which has the potential to involve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed combat forces.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> preferred the term `` high-probability conflict'' and defined it as `` our Marxist-Leninist foes exploiting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vulnerability _ the seams between the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created by regulatory missions and statutes.'' Guerrilla wars, such as those being fought today in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, generally involve low levels of combat with weaponry no more sophisticated than rifles or mortars. By definition, so-called conventional wars use advanced fighter jets, tanks and missiles. Part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces program for low-intensity conflict has been to train, equip and support foreign military forces. In the case of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 55 American advisers train the Salvadoran military to combat a leftist guerrilla insurgency. `` The whole thrust of our low-intensity conflict policy is to avoid the commitment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. `` There is no consensus in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in these small wars.'' He said the military traditionally has cited tensions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to justify huge military outlays and sophisticated weaponry. Soldiers, in turn, he added, received encouragement to pursue careers in the infantry, cavalry or artillery rather than the elite special operations forces. <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, however, said low-intensity conflict is the `` big challenge'' and added: `` It does n't matter if everybody understands it. What matters is that you have people in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who support it.''

 Talk show host <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> received an honorary doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and gave $ 1 million to establish a scholarship at the private men's college. `` The world awaits what you have to give,'' she said after receiving an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree during commencement ceremonies Sunday. `` The pressure is on.'' Ms. <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> said she established the <ORGANIZATION> Oprah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winfrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> because she felt she should share her good fortune. She chose <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> because the students and faculty treated her warmly during a January 1988 visit, including sending her a sweatshirt, she said. `` I wear that sweatshirt like I know everybody at <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Now that I have this doctorate, people are going to have to get a special dispensation to talk to me.''

She said that because of her celebrity status, she is exposed to vicious rumors, which she tries to ignore. `` Every single negative thing you do damages your spirit,'' she said. `` It keeps you from flying.

<HEAD>Gas Price Hikes Slow, Rise Only a Penny a Gallon in Past Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average price of gasoline rose a penny a gallon in the last two weeks, the smallest increase since the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill sent gas prices soaring, an analyst said. For all grades of gasoline, pump prices rose to $ 1.1843 per gallon between May 5 and Friday, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. Wholesale prices dropped only about one-third of a cent per gallon during the same period, according to the most recent <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey of 13,000 gasoline stations. `` This is the highest overall price seen for the nation since January of 1986, just before the world oil price competition cut world oil prices in half,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said of retail prices. But the recent price hike was the smallest since the March 24 grounding of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> _ an environmental disaster that briefly closed the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, temporarily cutting crude oil supplies and sending prices soaring by 10 cents per gallon. That was followed by another nickel-per-gallon increase as of April 21, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. Heavy competition among wholesalers accounts for the small size of the latest increase, she said. `` Wholesalers and refiners, knowing full well that the recent prices were rapid and surprising to many consumers, are trying very hard to tow the line and not to lose sales,'' she said. Normally, prices continue to rise during the high-consumption summer season, so the price slowdown may not be a trend, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` It is possible that a lull in gasoline price rises will occur, but it can not be expected because demand seems strong at a time when gasoline supplies are not in surplus,'' she said. Prices at self-serve stations were $ 1.0905 per gallon for regular unleaded, $ 1.2415 for premium unleaded and $ 1.0742 for regular leaded. Full service prices were $ 1.3358 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, $ 1.4536 for premium unleaded, and $ 1.3109 for regular leaded.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> crossed the threshold of ballistic missile capability today by successfully test-firing its first medium-range surface-to-surface missile into the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, news reports said. The missile was fired from the seaside launch site at <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION>, about 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The 7.5-ton missile has a range capability of about 1,500 miles, sufficient to hit targets as far as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and islands near the equator to the south, western military officials said. It can also hit any target in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars in the past 42 years. Defense experts say the missile's one-ton payload capability is more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead. The test firing was <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s third attempt at launching the Agni missile, whose name means `` fire'' in the ancient Sanskrit language. The first firing, scheduled for April 20, was postponed by last-minute problems with the ignition system. A second launch, set for May 1, was canceled after an error in one of the rocket's sub-systems By successfully firing the missile, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in ballistic missile capability. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said 11,000 people living in 13 villages near the launch site were evacuated from their homes Sunday evening as a security measure. The villagers have protested the test-firing for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if more launches are held at <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s colonia ruler, first used the site in 1893 to test ammunition. The Indians turned it into a missile test range in 1986 because of an unusual feature _ it faced the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> and during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles, enabling faster and easier recovery of shells and other short-range projectiles. The bay also has light commercial and naval traffic. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. Western military experts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> questioned the stance from a military standpoint, however. `` You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But if you are using a nuclear warhead, the exact target does not matter,'' he said. `` I am not saying that the Indians are going to use a nuclear warhead, but the question is why not.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in one week. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says its nuclear program is intended for non-military purposes, such as generating power. The test firing of the intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, was only `` a technology demonstration of the country's capabilities,'' according to the government. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> previously test-fired three surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles.

 Folks in these parts do n't have to go all the way to <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> to see the Leaning Tower after a stubborn high-rise refused to collapse despite two demolition blasts. `` We've got one building leaning and one building leaning against it,'' Police Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's a hazardous condition and I do n't know what could happen.'' A cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the 10-story building about 8:30 a.m., but the structure remained standing. Patrolman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> said demolition crews were unsure why the implosion failed to work. The demolition experts, who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in the first implosion, fetched 36 pounds of more explosives for the second try. This time, part of the building tipped slightly and leaned against another tower, but the structure remained standing. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said a few families living nearby would have to find somewhere else to stay until the building was brought down. Residents without a place to go would be accommodated, officials said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, head of the city's housing authority, said it could take two weeks for the wrecking crews to dismantle the listing building. The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> had planned to tear down the complex and build smaller buildings for housing. City officials felt that tearing down the deteriorating towers would be cheaper than renovation. The tower and two others are the subject of a federal suit filed by Project BASIC, a housing advocacy group, against the housing authority. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> allowed the tower to be demolished after architects ruled that the building, when being prepared for demolition, was made unsafe.

<HEAD>Dollar Hits 19-Month High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Massive dollar buying, spurred partly by unrest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, pushed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to a 19-month high today, while stock prices gained moderately. The dollar's closing of 140.45 yen, up 1.68 yen from Friday's close of 138.77 yen, marked the first time the dollar had closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987 The dollar opened at 139.37 and ranged between 139.35 yen and 140.65 yen in heavy trading. With only a slight pause last Friday, it has climbed 6.01 yen since May 11. Dealers said dollar buying also was encouraged by the dollar's continued rise despite intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> The central bank sold an estimated $ 2 billion. `` The unrest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was the direct motivation for the dollar buying,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Dealers also mentioned political uncertainty in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the ruling party has been unable so far to find a successor for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who is resigning over an influence-peddling scandal. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 144.65-point gainer on Friday, added another 65.90 points, or 0.19 percent, closing at 34,067.86. Securities dealers said many investors were waiting on the sidelines to watch developments in exchange rates and in the domestic political situation. Trade volume in the first section was estimated at 550 million shares. `` Until the market environment clears, we can hardly predict the market direction right now,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity. Dealers attributed the slight gain in the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index to rises in overseas stock markets last week. `` The market itself is ready for another rally, and we just have to wait for the environment to calm down,'' the dealer said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON> solved their last case on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'S `` Miami Vice,'' tossed in their badges after breaking all the rules and rode off, more or less, into the sunset alive and well. The rumor was that either <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, would die in the final two-hour show, which was broadcast Sunday night. But both survived several gunfights, winding up five years on the air. As the hip, stylish series ended, <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON> was preparing to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> was heading <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> said, `` I'm going where the water's warm, the drinks are cold and I do n't know the name of the players.'' Their final case was a suicide mission to a Latin American country to snatch a dictator during a revolution. As usual, they were double-crossed at every turn, but still came out the winners. In the finale, they took on federal agents trying to spirit the dictator away to freedom in violation of an agreement that he would turn informer on his drug-dealing partners. Their own police chief was on the Colombian payroll and was killed. The dictator died as <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON> shot down his seaplane when it was taking off on the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> waterfront. `` Miami Vice'' made quite a splash with its debut in September 1984. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> portrayed two dashing vice-squad detectives on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>. They dressed in expensive pastel-colored clothing, drove a Ferrari and solved their cases in glamorous settings to the accompaniment of pulsating rock music. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> became a sex symbol as the macho detective who wore a three-day growth of beard and no socks. He parlayed his fame into a budding film career. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> also gained a movie career from his role as the mystical, taciturn Lt. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>. The glitz soon wore off. After the first year, the stories became mere excuses for <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tubbs </PERSON> to tool around in nighttime <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as the lights bounced off their Ferrari or as backdrops for the fashion show. In the final season, at the insistence of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the scripts were improved, but the ratings continued to slip. At the beginning of the last season, executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> made preparations to end the show. He said he wanted the series to go off in as stylish a manner as it had gone on. Last season, <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> married a rock singer, played by <PERSON> Sheena </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, but after several shows she was killed. The current season opened with <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> believing he actually was his undercover alter ego, drug dealer <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. Guest stars on the series over the years included singers <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> and the Fat Boys. Convicted Watergate conspirator <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> also made an appearance, as did <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, a star in the early `` Saturday Night Live'' comedy show who died at age 42 after a lengthy battle with cancer, talked about confronting `` the Big C'' in her forthcoming autobiography. `` I got a little cocky,'' she writes in `` It's Always Something,'' due out in June. `` I always had a twinkle in my eye as though I'd touched the face of God ... I was plenty full of myself. `` What I've learned the hard way is that there's always something you can do. In some cases, death seems more desirable. But there is always something you can do.'' The creator of such memorable television characters as New York-street smart reporter <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Roseannadana </PERSON>, speech-impeded talk show host <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wawa </PERSON> and out-of-sync editorialist <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Litella </PERSON> died of ovarian cancer Saturday with husband <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> at her side. Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, who was diagnosed with the cancer in 1986, died in her sleep at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>. She had radiation therapy and other treatments, including surgery, as recently as February. She re-entered the hospital Wednesday, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. The comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that `` cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world.'' In her book, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> writes that she did not see cancer in a humorous light at all times, but there were moments. `` The next thing you know, I'm kind of running down the street with my arms spread out in this raincoat yelling in a Captain Midnight voice, ` Cancer Woman,' look at her go!'' In recent years Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> appeared in several movies, but was best known for roles in sketches on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live,'' with such stars as <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>. The show brought her an Emmy Award for outstanding performance by an actress in a variety series. On Saturday's show, host <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> _ visibly choked with emotion _ introduced a 1978 clip in which he and Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> did a comic dance `` You know, when I look at that tape I ca n't help but think how great she was and how young I look,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON>, we miss you.'' `` I loved her like a sister,'' <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman. `` My thoughts are with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> and her family.'' Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> had a `` very natural effervescence that seemed to come out of her during those five years,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` It was just an electric thing that would even help you get through a performance if you were down.'' A <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> native, Miss <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> attended the University of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and began her entertainment career in the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of `` Godspell,'' then became a member of the `` Second City'' improvisational group. She was chosen for the original cast of `` Saturday Night Live'' in 1975, and stayed with the show until 1980. She met <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in 1981 on the set of the movie `` Hanky Panky'' and the romance blossomed three years later while making `` The Woman in Red,'' which was written and directed by <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. A return to television as a special guest on `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show'' earned her an Emmy nomination for comedy performance in 1988.

 <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>'s classmates and teachers remember how she made them laugh long before her zany characters on `` Saturday Night Live'' made the nation laugh. While the show business world paid homage to <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>, 42, who died Saturday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after a three-year battle against ovarian cancer, the comedian was recalled by those who knew her in her native <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` Her sense of humor was constant and engaging,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgwin </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> drama professor. `` When she was a student in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, we sort of got a free ` Saturday Night Live' every day because of that bubbling attitude toward life, and it was original.'' <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> `` was a wonderful fountain of wit and joy,'' <PERSON> Burgwin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> remembered the time in high school when <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> acted like her `` Saturday Night Live'' co-star, <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> `` There was a play once, ` The Mouse That Roared,''' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, a classmate of <PERSON> Radner </PERSON>'s at the <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pointe </LOCATION>. `` She was upstairs in the dressing room trying to get dressed. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> was the queen -LRB- on stage -RRB-. <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> lost her balance and literally rolled down the stairs and onto the stage. `` She began ad-libbing right away,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` The teacher behind the stage was just having a fit because she could n't follow the script. It was really cute.'' Born in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> attended the all-girls <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and graduated in 1964. In her freshman year, <PERSON> Radner </PERSON> performed with her school choir with the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>. In her junior year, she transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and worked as a volunteer at <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Actually I was going to teach retarded kids. I used to work with the emotionally disturbed in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in 1977. She returned to <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> for her senior year, then enrolled at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> as a drama student. She left without obtaining a degree. `` I think she was bored, quite frankly,'' <PERSON> Burgwin </PERSON> said. `` There are performers who need and want training, and there are others who are themselves, and ready to go. `` I think <PERSON> Gilda </PERSON> made the right judgment. What we had to give was not what she needed.''

The state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week determined the gaming hall's $ 144 million debt was too big a risk to the industry's integrity to allow continued play on <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>' three-tiered casino floor Only subtle signs indicated casino employees were working their last shift. A blackjack dealer taped a small `` Goodbye'' note to his table, and some floor supervisors wore black-tinged carnations. At the craps table, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> threw out the last set of dice. `` I enjoyed myself here for seven years,'' he said. `` I wanted to do it for sentimental reasons, I guess.'' Atlantis has been plagued with financial problems since 1981, when it opened as the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Casino. In November 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but when a reorganization plan was finally implemented in September 1988, the losses continued to mount. The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the arm of the state attorney general's office that polices the industry, reported that the Atlantis was losing money at the rate of $ 56,000 a day. At the division's recommendation, the commission voted in April not to renew Atlantis' regular casino license and appointed a conservator. At least 1,000 of the hotel's 2,000 workers are affected by the casino closing. Near the slot machines, mechanics gathered to console each other this morning. `` Ordinarily, we'd be fixing machines, but it does n't matter now,'' said one mechanic who would identify himself only as <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` It took me a year and a half to get this job, and now I'm out looking again.'' The fate of the casino rests in the hands of the casino commission. Although developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has an agreement to purchase the place from <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 63 million, the state-appointed conservator, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, has recommended that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s agreement be rejected. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> argued that the deal was signed after he was in place as conservator, and that higher bids have been made. He also suggested that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who already owns two casinos and is building a third, would wield too much economic power if he bought the Atlantis and converted it into a luxury non-casino hotel as planned. The Atlantis closing does not necessarily mark the end of the legalized gambling `` experiment'' to rejuvenate the decaying resort, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, a gaming analyst with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment house of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But it does forewarn of other impending closures, he said. `` They'd better get used to these failures,'' he said. `` There's going to be a bunch of them, simply because the casino industry is so strung out now on debt Last year's debt was over $ 2 billion, and this year's will be even higher.''

 At a rally attended by tens of thousands, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and other reformers elected to the new Soviet congress were cheered as they swore to substitute their radical agenda for that of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` If, at this historic moment that is so important for the future of our country, we permit the apparatus to dictate to us as it has in past decades, we will not advance, but sink back into the swamp from which we'd only begun to extricate ourselves,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told Sunday's rally. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose members constitute 80 percent of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, convened a session of its policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today to work out its plans for the body, which meets in inaugural session Thursday. But many of the 2,250 members of the new congress are independent-minded Communists, and it was not known if they would follow the party line. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a one-time <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss, is himself a member of the party's 251-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and at Sunday's rally he and his anti-establishment colleagues called for contested presidential elections and urgent action on the economy. He demanded that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> give a public accounting of the first four years of his reforms during the opening session. Only then should the congress decide if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should be re-elected president, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> declared. The reformers' talk of specific legislative proposals indicated they may try to create a congress with far greater power than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may have intended. According to legislation approved last fall, the body would have just one regular session a year and elect from among its members the president as well as the smaller, working parliament, the Supreme Soviet. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told Sunday's rally that the congress itself, not the Supreme Soviet, should be the supreme legislative authority. The congress, directly elected by the people and a number of official organizations, includes hundreds of reformers. It is not clear if the reformers constitute a large enough faction to win selection to the working parliament. The party's intentions remained unclear. All 12 full members of its ruling Politburo were elected deputies but it was not known if they intend to serve in the Supreme Soviet as well. Many Soviets hope the congress will take swift action on problems ranging from empty store shelves to the unresolved ethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The radical tone of Sunday's rally, which drew an estimated at 30,000 people, was demonstrated by the loud cheers that greeted Deputy <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoukhov </PERSON>'s suggestion that `` we should elect true people's power with a true people's president: <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November 1987 and lost his seat on the party's ruling Politburo after he criticized the slow pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. He made a comeback in the March congressional elections, however, when his anti-establishment platform captured almost 90 percent of the vote in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> on Sunday called for convening an `` extraordinary party congress'' that would be empowered to replace old guard Communists on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Politburo. He said a group of 39 deputies elected to represent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the new <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> has drafted its own agenda for the session and demands `` radical decisions'' on reviving the stagnant economy, guaranteeing social justice and developing a more open society. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said that only after addressing that agenda and evaluating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s performance should the congress proceed `` to elect the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from among alternative candidates.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was unanimously elected to that post without an opponent on Oct. 1. But that election was by the Supreme Soviet, which has until recently been a rubber stamp legislature. Two prosecutors who have been accused of abusing their office in conducting a probe of alleged official corruption also addressed the rally to deafening cheers. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, who was accused of slander after he said publicly the names of Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and former Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> came up in his probe, called for a wider investigation of former high officials. Fellow prosecutor and deputy <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> said the party and government apparatus `` is scared by the people.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said, `` is in the very depths of an economic, political, moral and legal crisis.'' He demanded that apparatchiks `` give up power to the people.''

<BYLINE>Two Leading Politicians Charged with Bribery in Recruit Scandal

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors filed bribery charges today against two leading politicians, the first elected officials formally accused in the Recruit influence-peddling scandal. Prosecutors said the two received donations and highly discounted stock shares from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for using their political clout to help the company's magazine publishing business. Charged were <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, 56, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, 52, former secretary general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION>, or Clean Government Party. They were not taken into custody. The bribery charge carries a seven-year prison sentence. Before today, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen had been charged in the scandal, which has eroded public trust in politics. Last month, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would resign to take responsibility. The Liberal Democrats still are searching for a successor; most of the party's senior members have been linked to the scandal. Prosecutors questioned <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> several times last week, and their homes and offices were searched on Thursday. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, a former journalist and four-term member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s lower house, said in a statement today that the charges `` are not the truth They are a fabrication of reality.'' <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> said today that he would resign from the governing party, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> announced last week he would resign from Komeito and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, the chief government spokesman in former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s Cabinet and an eight-term member of the lower house, was widely considered a rising star among Liberal Democrats. He has acknowledged that an aide bought 12,000 shares of stock in a Recruit subsidiary at discounted prices in 1986 and then profited by about $ 215,000 when the stock was listed for public trading and rose rapidly in value. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> used a portion of the profit to buy a house in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, according to news reports. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former labor minister, also reportedly received about $ 640,000 in political donations from the company. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> has admitted that his brother bought 5,000 shares of stock in the Recruit subsidiary and profited by about $ 70,000. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> allegedly received $ 100,000 in donations from Recruit. Both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock transactions. Prosecutors say profits from the transactions were deposited in the politicians' bank accounts. They say <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> used their political influence to persuade government officials to continue a `` gentlemen's agreement'' among government agencies and private companies on a uniform date for the hiring of graduating college students Recruit believed the agreement was crucial for the sale of its employment magazines, prosecutors say. Prosecutors now have completed the bribery investigation in the scandal and now will focus on illegal political donations made by Recruit, an information services and publishing conglomerate, news reports said. Japanese law limits the amount of money that companies can donate to politicians. A company the size of Recruit is restricted to about $ 110,000 in political donations a year. Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has acknowledged that he received about $ 1 million in donations from Recruit betweeb 1985 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> last week agreed to the opposition's demand that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> testify before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about any links he may have to Recruit He is expected to testify on Thursday.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Curiosity is luring tourists to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest national park a year after fire scarred roughly half of its 2.2 million acres. `` I have n't been here since I was a kid,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurrad </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` If the fires had n't happened, I would n't have come here.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, superintendent of the 117-year-old park, said Saturday that predictions that curiosity would attract visitors appeared to be coming true. `` There was great concern early on because reservations were down,'' he said. `` But that has reversed itself. In April, our reservations were 29 percent above last April. I am convinced we are going to have an excellent season.'' Officials for <ORGANIZATION> TW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the park's chief concessionaire, report bookings at the Old Faithful Inn, the only lodging open during the park's early spring season, were running 5 percent ahead of projections. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, front office manager, said all 327 rooms have been booked since May 14. Some areas that were burned are erupting in the reds, yellows and oranges of wildflowers, although many areas remain blackened from the fires. `` I did n't think it would be as bad as what I read,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a park visitor. `` And I do n't think it is. I think it will get better over time.'' On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, speaking at a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, defended news coverage of the fires. He said the impression the park was destroyed was reached largely by the news audience itself. `` Too many people think of a national park as a city park, except larger,'' he said. `` The same popular perception applies to fires. They think of flames only as a destructive force. When there are fires in a national park, to most people, that is not good news.'' Visitors on Saturday said they did not believe the fires took anything away from the park's basic beauty. `` I think a lot of it here is still really pretty,'' <PERSON> Gurrad </PERSON> said. `` But there are going to be some pretty ugly spots, too. There are some spots that are really dead.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, once rooted in rigid communist ideology, was making a transition from revolutionary force to modern army when it was confronted by the surprising strength of the pro-democracy movement. Although the imposition of martial law makes the demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> illegal, solidiers have been reluctant, unable or ordered not to halt them. Young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic reform. Some flashed V-for-victory signs when their trucks retreated away from the city. It has become even harder to decipher how senior military officers were reacting to the most serious challenge to the social order the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has faced in its 40-year rule. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s one remaining official post is as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and it is believed to have been <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> who ordered the crackdown on the student movement. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is certain to have the support of other older officers who served in the old <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and continue to regard the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as the last bastion of revolutionary integrity. Less certain is the backing of younger officers, the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>'s new ranks of professionals who may share some of the students' concerns about the slow pace of political reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> played a major role in restoring order during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when fighting between different leftist factions brought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the brink of civil war. Since then, however, the nation's trust in the ideological purity of the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> has begun to slip. In the early 1980s, the army abandoned <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s concept of a guerrilla `` people's war,'' in which the army would beat back an attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since 1985, when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fielded 4.2 million soldiers. He has brought back a ranking system abandoned for 23 years, emphasized better training and sought to create a modern military force. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>, however, has been saddled with severe budgetary restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic modernization programs. About two-thirds of defense industry factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost national production and exports. From 1950 to 1980, defense spending accounted for 17.2 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state expenditures, the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> says. In 1988, it received only 7.49 percent of the budget. Defense spending in actual terms is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> ranks were filled with young people attracted to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of escaping rural poverty. <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> members still command respect, but the low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more difficult. In well-off rural areas, families commonly pay off local officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment. One recent report in the official media said the army is ending up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who have criminal records. Many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts young people have come to expect. Such recruits are now listening with sympathy when students their own age chant `` the people's army belongs to the people.''

 Three men linked to a radical Palestinian group suspected in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bombing over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> have been charged with attempting to bomb Israeli and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline offices, according to news reports. Two other men also linked to the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> have been arraigned on charges involving robberies in the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> area, the Sunday reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION>, a splinter group opposed to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, is suspected of being behind the bombing of New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which expoded over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in December, killing 270 people. The five men were arraigned on Saturday. They were detained in a roundup of 15 people by security police on Thursday. Police have refused to comment on the case or say whether the other 10 were released. Three of the men were charged with suspected complicity in a 1985 terrorist attack on a Danish synagogue and the attempted bombings of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline offices, according to the news reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> daily quoted a prosecutor as saying police identified the fingerprints of one of the suspects from a bag used in an unsuccessful bomb attack on the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> airline office in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, in 1985.

 Sixty lawmakers from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demanded today a halt to all private contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the communist government's hard line against pro-democracy demonstrators. `` We should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until the Chinese communists lift martial law and end any military crackdown,'' the legislators said in a statement to the government. On Saturday, Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> imposed martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and ordered troops to end massive protests that have spread through <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the past month. His hard-line policy has encountered resistance, and reports from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Monday said military leaders have opposed it. The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> lawmakers said the Nationalist government should offer to open direct trade and shipping links between the rival nations if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cancels the crackdown order and acknowledges the protests are `` patriotic and democratic.'' The legislature, which is dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has 297 seats. The Nationalists, who fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 when they lost a civil war on the mainland, continue to claim they are the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They are technically still at war with the Chinese communists, and they have refused to have any direct contacts with the mainland government. But in the past two years, they have pursued a flexible policy that has allowed Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through third countries. Government spokesman <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-ming </PERSON> said on Sunday that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would continue to pursue its flexible policy but would reassess it if the situation on the mainland deteriorates and threatens to endanger <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents. Legislator <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-wen </PERSON>, who initiated the statement signed by 60 lawmakers, said a successful military crackdown could set back democracy on the mainland by 20 years and `` we would miss a good opportunity to reunite -LRB- <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- peacefully.'' The Nationalists ended 38 years of martial law in 1987. They say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, considered a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province by both the Nationalists and communists, should be reunited under a democratic system. The legislators said they will submit their statement to the lawmaking Legislative Yuan for discussion Tuesday and then relay it to the government Cabinet. Also Monday, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-heng </PERSON>, 35, a clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, began a three-day hunger strike in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> to protest what he described as `` Taiwanese indifference'' to the democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hu, a native Taiwanese, staged his strike at a park dedicated to the late President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>, who led the defeated Nationalists to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the mainland. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> died in 1975. Students and faculty at some universities have signed petitions supporting the democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but there have been no major public rallies.

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> detained more than 250 Moslem fundamentalists and seized a cache of automatic weapons in the biggest arrest raid since the Palestinian uprising began, the army announced. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, unidentified gunmen fired three shots at police in the center of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, police and army officials said. One shot hit a police car, but no one was injured. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said soldiers at a hitch-hiking post in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert reported gunmen in a passing car shot at them today. They were not hit. The shootings and discovery of the weapons cache came amid mounting concern over Palestinian threats to step up violence and end a policy of not using guns in the 17-month-old uprising. Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the deputy army spokesman, said there recently has been an increase in <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' use of firearms. `` We see it as a grave development,'' he said in an interview. Elsewhere today, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in a clash in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Dir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balah </LOCATION>. And six women were hurt by metal pellets fired by soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In clashes on Sunday, soldiers shot and killed two Palestinians and wounded at least 25, according to hospital reports. The deaths raised to 496 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have been slain. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, head of the army's central command, said the arrest operation in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was a `` decisive blow'' to <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of Moslem fundamentalists. `` In the long term ... there will be a reduction of violence in the area,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said in comments broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, which means `` zeal'' in Arabic, takes a harder line than the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in seeking an Islamic nation that would exclude the existence of a Jewish state. Many of its leaders oppose peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An army announcement said security forces confiscated 18 weapons, including pistols, U.S.-made M-16 and Soviet Kalashnikov automatic rifles, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Uzi submachine guns and Swedish <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> rifles. The statement said <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> members fired at an Israeli car and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> man digging a well in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in March 1988. The group also was blamed for throwing an explosive device at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. According to the army, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> planned anti-Israeli demonstrations, firebombed shops of storekeepers who violated strike orders by the uprising leadership and killed Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or those who were involved in drugs and prostitution. About 45 suspected collaborators have been killed in the uprising. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said that among those detained was Sheikh <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, the spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> who was accused of ordering beatings and shootings of suspected collaborators. <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, had been sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1984 after being convicted of having knowledge of concealed weapons. He was released in a prisoner exchange in 1985. The raids against <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> were conducted during a six-day curfew in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that confined some 700,000 people to their homes. The army lifted the curfew on Sunday but few Gazans went to their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because of a strike ordered by leaders of the uprising. There was increased concern that Palestinians had escalated their rebellion. A leaflet published this week by pro-PLO activists called on Palestinians to kill an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier or settler for every Palestinian killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Last week, three Palestinians fired on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, killing one soldier and wounding seven before they were killed. It was the first gun battle of the uprising. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, the chief of a radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, also called for the use of firearms by Palestinians in an interview published in the Kuwaiti daily <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watan </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, of involvement in the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in which an American, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was killed.

<HEAD>Union Vows To Keep Teachers On Picket Lines As Weekend Talks Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The teachers strike in the nation's second-largest school district entered its second week today after weekend talks broke down Union representatives walked away from the bargaining table after two hours Sunday night. `` It's been a waste of time,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that their whole agenda now is not to bring about a satisfactory solution. Their whole agenda is to break <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION>.'' No formal talks have been scheduled in the dispute, which has crippled the 500,000-student district since May 15, when the union representing 22,000 of the system's 32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians walked out. The strike is the district's first since a 23-day walkout in 1970. School board President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> said the district had boosted its offer of a 21.5 percent raise over three years to 24 percent, contingent on the district getting a share of a $ 2.5 billion state tax windfall. The teachers call that contingency unacceptable and are demanding 26 percent. Many students have stayed out of the classrooms. Students in some schools were put in auditoriums because there were n't enough substitute teachers. Teachers earn between $ 23,440 and $ 43,319 a year.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said today it will cut sharply the number of British employees in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, apparently in retaliation for the expulsions from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of 11 Soviets accused of espionage. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said on Sunday that it secretly ordered the expulsion of eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists on Friday. On Saturday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> retaliated with an identical set of expulsions of Britons. The Soviets took the diplomatic rift a step further today. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasmiov </PERSON> told a news conference that the number of Britons accredited in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the number of Soviets working for Britons would be reduced from 375 to 205. The new limit for British employees would be equal to the number of Soviets now permitted to work in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The British Embassy had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s statement <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not say how long the reductions would take, or who exactly they would affect. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> provoked the dispute with its expulsions on Friday. Embassy Counselor Lev Parshin called the expulsion order `` deplorable, unfriendly and provocative'' and said it `` remains to be seen'' how the dispute will affect Anglo-Soviet relations. He denied that the expelled Soviets had done anything wrong. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Sunday said its expulsions were legitimate, though it did not give details, and that the Soviet response was unjustified. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> radio said the Soviets had been caught spying on military installations. Both countries expelled eight diplomats and three journalists and each was was given 14 days to leave. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> she was disappointed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had to expel the Soviets, but `` we gave them the chance and they have not taken it and they have revealed their true nature.'' She said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had hoped a new era was being ushered into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but `` many things are still the same.'' The rift came at a time of improved relations between the nations. The two leaders enjoy a good personal relationship, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received a warm greeting when he visited <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in early May. One of the expelled journalists, <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Roxburgh </PERSON>, denied spying and said he was angry with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over `` being caught up in the latest diplomatic chess game.'' `` Why do the British have such a predilection for expelling Soviet spies? Presumably there are as many Russians engaged in ` impermissible activities' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, yet expulsions from those countries are much rarer,'' he wrote in The Times today. The other journalists expelled on Saturday, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover-James </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, also denied improper conduct. `` I'm not guilty of any spying, lawbreaking or any impermissible activity,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director-general, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Birt </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> would `` vigorously resist'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' expulsion. The British Foreign Office accused the Soviets of `` incompatible activities,'' diplomatic parlance for espionage. Foreign Minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s action `` a measured action in respect of established misbehavior.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had `` incontrovertible evidence'' of wrongdoing by the expelled Soviets, he said. Asked why the British government kept its expulsions quiet, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, `` We look at these on a case-by-case basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government had kept a `` bizarre and inexplicable silence.'' `` The British public deserve a lot more information before they will accept that this is justified,'' said party spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The diplomatic row was the biggest between the two countries since 1985, when both expelled 31 diplomats, journalists and other representatives. In 1971, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled 105 Soviets. The Soviet move against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Monday could mirror action it took against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the middle of a spying dispute in October 1986. In that case, the Soviets stripped the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> of 260 Soviet employees who handled many of the mission's non-diplomatic jobs Since then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has operated without Soviet employees.

<HEAD>Court to Study Social Security Regulation in Colorado Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to study a federal regulation aimed at saving the government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients. The court said it will study a ruling in a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> case that struck down the regulation. The regulation applies to two Social Security programs: old age, survivors and disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. Adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the rule covers instances in which the government at different times overpays and underpays benefit recipients. The rule allows officials to balance the overpayments against underpayments, arriving at a net amount that is either owed the government or the recipient. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, ruled last August that the regulation is illegal because it may operate to deprive needy recipients of the chance to keep overpayments. The appeals court ruling applies to recipients in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Federal appeals courts elsewhere have handed down conflicting rulings. The 10th Circuit court said federal law requires that the government abandon recovery of overpayments when a recipient is blameless or if returning the extra benefits would cause the recipient serious hardship. The appeals court rejected government arguments that allowing recipients to keep the extra money is an unfair windfall. `` An overpaid beneficiary who does not have to repay excess benefits is not receiving a windfall but rather is benefitting from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' express provision that recovery -LRB- by the government -RRB- must be waived in appropriate situations,'' the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> laywers said the appeals court misunderstood the way the disputed regulation works. They said the rule would not deprive needy people of the opportunity eventually to keep the extra money. The government said the regulation would spare the government from paying out millions of extra dollars automatically and then going through an elaborate procedure to recover some of the money. Government lawyers said that from 1981 to 1986 an average of 4.7 million people each year received too much or too little due to errors in the retirement and survivor's insurance program alone. The case is <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Everhart </PERSON>, 88-1323.

 Mass murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys and young men, lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The justices rejected arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' death penalty law wrongly gives county prosecutors `` complete and unguided discretion to determine whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases.'' <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert psychiatric witness for the defense. Both arguments were rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Sept. 29. The high court's action came without comment other than a dissenting statement by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who oppose capital punishment under all circumstances. No one in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history has been convicted of killing more people than <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>. Police found 29 of <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s victims in the crawl space beneath his <LOCATION> Norwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Four more had been in nearby rivers. Prosecutors said the murders were committed over a three-year period beginning in 1975. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> said he strangled all but one of the 33 by wrapping rope around their necks and twisting it with a stick. He sexually assaulted some of the victims before killing them. A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native, <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the early 1970s to start a successful remodeling business. He often hired teen-age boys. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, who received death sentences for 12 of the murders and life terms for each of the remaining 21, now resides at <ORGANIZATION> Menard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. A January execution date was postponed, and no new date has been set The last execution in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> occurred in 1962. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s name surfaced briefly in the 1988 presidential campaign when a pamphlet distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> contended that <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed his crimes in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> under Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> labeled the pamphlet `` garbage,'' and <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> later wrote to state Republican officials to complain about what he called the `` sleazy'' tactic. The case is <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, 88-6828.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to shield <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from being sued for monetary damages in state court for allegedly allowing excessive noise and air pollution at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that could allow such lawsuits. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> owns and operates <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, one of the world's busiest airports. Lawyers for the city said the number of flights in and out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> is projected to rise to over one million a year by 1995. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>, who since 1967 has lived in suburban <LOCATION> Bensenville </LOCATION>, sued the city and various other defendants in federal court over <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. The suit included allegations that <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>'s constitutionally protected property rights were being violated and that the airport was a nuisance A federal trial judge threw out the entire lawsuit, but the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said last Dec. 13 that the judge had gone too far. The appeals court ruled that <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON> should have a chance to prove the nuisance and other state tort law claims in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> court. Such a lawsuit is not pre-empted by federal law, the appeals court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 ruled that state and local regulations of airports and air travel generally must yield to federal control. The court said an airport may not be charged with negligence or creating a nuisance for conduct that complies with federal laws and regulations. But the 1973 decision did not involve a government-run airport, and a now-disputed footnote to that ruling said, `` We do not consider here what limits, if any, apply to a municipality as a proprietor.'' In <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>'s case, the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Neither the Constitution nor the Federal Aviation Act, as amended by the Noise Control Act of 1972, determines how <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> apportions its governmental powers.'' The appeals court said the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allows states to govern the operation of publicly owned airports. It ordered that <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>'s suit be dismissed without prejudice so he could pursue his case in state court. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s appeal, lawyers for the city argued, `` With jet travel comes noise and with such noise come attempts by state and local governments and by individuals such as Bieneman to limit noise.'' `` To the extent such state and local measures pertain to noise from planes in flight,'' the appeal said, `` they run afoul of the federal regulatory scheme and of considerations of interstate commerce.'' The justices today also rejected a separate appeal by <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON> seeking to revive his constitutional claims, and a third appeal by numerous airlines operating out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. The cases are <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Bieneman </PERSON>, 88-1496; Bieneman vs. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 88-1497; and <ORGANIZATION> Amerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 88-1670.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Former Chicago Councilman Convicted of Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> councilman convicted of fraud for conspiring illegally to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties. The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> to set guidelines on when some people may challenge their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those convictions. Only Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, 83, was paroled in 1978 after nearly two years in prison. Lower courts said, in effect, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> now has too little at stake to mount such a challenge. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, although agreeing with the lower courts, nevertheless urged the justices to hear <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>'s appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the case should be used to resolve a recurring conflict among federal courts. For example, former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>'s conviction under the same federal anti-fraud law was overturned by a federal judge in 1987 after <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON> was released from prison. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has an appeal pending before the high court that seeks to reinstate <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>'s conviction, which stemmed from a scheme to help friends who owned a racetrack in return for more than $ 380,000 in gifts. In the case acted on today, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> was convicted in 1974 of mail fraud. Prosecutors said that while a city councilman he formed a secret partnership to acquire tax-delinquent property at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> scavenger sales. The prosecutors said <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> used his influence as chairman of the city council's finance committee to reduce tax liens on the parcels and then convinced friends at public agencies to buy the parcels at more than their market price. There was conflicting evidence at the trial as to whether <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> made a profit from his efforts. A separate state court trial concluded that <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> did not make any money. The jury in the federal trial was told it could convict <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> of fraud without finding that he made any profit or that the taxpayers suffered a tangible loss. A guilty verdict could be based on a finding <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> defrauded the citizens of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> of their intangible right to his faithful and loyal services, the jury was told. After his federal conviction, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> was sentenced to prison and fined $ 27,000. Years after he was freed and completed his parole, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1987 that a federal mail fraud conviction may not be based on a defendant's defrauding the public of its intangible right to honest and impartial government. The justices said there must be some tangible loss suffered by taxpayers. That ruling prompted <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> to go back to the federal courts to have his conviction overturned. He also sought return of the $ 27,000 fine. A federal judge threw out <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>'s challenge, and the decision was upheld last July by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said too little was at stake for the courts to expend valuable resources to consider the challenge years after <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> had served his time in prison. The $ 27,000 fine `` is a sunk cost rather than a continuing disability producing additional injury as time passes,'' the appeals court said. It also said the harm to <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>'s reputation does not `` justify the investment of judicial time necessary to decide whether he is entitled to vindication.'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> might have been convicted of mail fraud even if the jury were told to base its verdict on a tangible loss of property, the 7th Circuit court added. `` No one can accept without unease the thought the legal system tolerates erroneous convictions,'' the appeals court said. But it said, `` At some point the judicial system must close old files and turn to the future, regretfully accepting the risk of error lest the quest for perfect justice becomes the enemy of adequate justice.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said even though they agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> court ruling the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should review the matter. Other appeals courts erroneously have made it easier for convicted criminals who have completed their sentences to challenge their convictions, the government said. The case is <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-1178.

 Wildlife officials believe the endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor is on the rebound after the hatching of a fourth bird bred in captivity. <PERSON> Kaduku </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Konkow </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> name means `` very strong being, both physically and spiritually,'' became the 31st known condor when it popped out of its shell Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> without much help from keepers. The chick weighed in at 5.8 ounces. Its aqua-colored egg was laid on Easter. `` This is the first time in two decades that there have been more than 30 of the birds,'' said park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>. `` We expect a lot more hatches next year.'' All known <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors, which are <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land birds with wingspans up to 9 -LCB- feet, have been captured in hopes of rebuilding their numbers to the point where the species can be reintroduced in the wild. Seventeen of the birds are at the Wild Animal Park; the 14 others are at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, the first captive-bred condor, which hatched last year, remains in good health, as do all three chicks produced this year, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. Another egg is expected to hatch in about two weeks. Next year's mating season, more of the condors will have reached sexual maturity Handlers feed the chicks using lifelike condor puppets to keep the birds from becoming attached to humans. The number of the black carrion-eaters dwindled dangerously low because of shooting and pesticide poisoning.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T's Largest Union Authorizes Strike; Saturday is Deadline</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's largest union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract with the telecommunications giant is not reached by Saturday, union officials said today. The Communications Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did not release a breakdown of the vote authorizing its executive council to call a strike, with the date to be determined by union President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> represents about 130,000 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` At this stage, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has yet to seriously address issues of concern to our members, particularly the issue of employment security,'' <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said in announcing results of the secret-ballot authorization vote. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> employees, is negotiating jointly with <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and is conducting a strike authorization vote. `` We're united with <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in a statement released with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> results. `` Together our members are determined to win jobs with justice and a contract worthy of the skills and productivity of our members.'' An <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> vote was not surprising and expressed hope a strike could be averted. `` It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give the leadership such authorization,'' spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. `` It does n't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hard week, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work stoppage.'' The negotiations began in late March but have stalled over a company proposal to shift more health care costs to employees. The two sides also have significant differences on pay, according to union officials. The company was expected to make its formal contract offer to the unions early this week. The current contracts expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> officials have given mixed signals about whether a strike would be called immediately if the deadline passed without a new contract agreement. If the unions and company appear close to an agreement the unions likely would extend the deadline by a day or two. Even if the two sides remain substantially short of a new contract, many union leaders believe the unions will not immediately strike but instead will implement a plan for a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T long-distance service, a move they say will cost the company upwards of $ 10 million a month. Under this scenario, union leaders say they would at first rely on the boycott to pressure <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T into concessions and if no significant progress was made they then could catch <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T off guard with a strike. Indeed, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> statement today stressed that a strike `` is only one of several tactics to achieve a fair contract.'' The boycott plan calls for labor unions and related organizations, which predominantly are <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T customers, to temporarily switch their long distance calls to non-union <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> by using <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s local access number. The unions and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> also have pledged to urge their major vendors to boycott <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. This year is the first time <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> have negotiated jointly. Three years ago <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> struck <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for 26 days, but the company was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants open because the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> agreed to work provided its members were given any added benefits <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> won through its strike. That bitter experience, which came in the first contract talks after the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T breakup, led to the agreement to negotiate jointly this year. <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> have promised that their unions will stick together in the event of a strike.

<HEAD>Court Limits Federal Judges' Power to Exclude Evidence in Pennsylvania
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today limited federal judges' power to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials, ruling against a young <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> man who lost his arm in a car wash accident. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s product-liability lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s criminal record Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said federal rules of evidence require judges `` to permit impeachment of a civil witness with evidence of prior felony convictions regardless of ensuant unfair prejudice to the witness or the party offering the testimony.'' Federal judges may exclude evidence only when it is a criminal defendant who might be harmed by it, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said in interpreting a particular rule of evidence. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was 19 when he lost his arm in a June 23, 1984, accident at the Lemoyne Minit Car Wash near <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was on work-release employment from the county prison He had reached into a towel-drying machine that his suit alleged was defective. The machine tore <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s right arm completely off at the shoulder. He sued the drying machine's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Bock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laundry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. At trial, <PERSON> Bock </PERSON>'s lawyers were allowed to tell jurors through cross-examining <PERSON> Green </PERSON> that he had been convicted of several felonies, including burglary and statutory rape <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s lawsuit was tried in federal court because <PERSON> Bock </PERSON> is not based in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. A jury ruled for <PERSON> Bock </PERSON>, and a federal appeals court upheld the manufacturer's trial victory. The appeals court said the trial judge had no discretion to exclude such evidence in a civil, or non-criminal, trial. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` No error occurred when the jury in this product-liability suit learned through impeaching cross-examination that plantiff <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was a convicted felon,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented. They said the federal rule of evidence in question should allow trial judges `` to consider the risk of prejudice faced by any party, not just a criminal defendant.'' Writing for the three, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said: `` This case should have been decided on the basis of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laundry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> designed and sold a dangerously defective machine without providing adequate warnings. `` The fact that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> was a convicted felon ... has little, if anything, to do with the issues. We can not know precisely why the jury refused to compensate him for the sad and excruciating loss of his arm, but there is a very real possibility that it was influenced improperly by his criminal record. I believe that this is not a result <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> conceivably could have intended.'' The case is Green vs. <ORGANIZATION> Bock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laundry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1816.

 Jury selection began today in the trial of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> on charges he had sex with an underage girl. The 58-year-old Republican had no comment as he entered the courtroom. He has denied the allegation and claimed the girl's mother tried to extort money from him <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was indicted Feb. 23 on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is divorced, was accused of having sex with the 16-year-old girl in his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last year. By mid-morning, four potential jurors had been questioned about their knowledge of the case and whether their opinion had been swayed by publicity over the weekend about the trial and a plea bargain offered by <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>. A source said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> had offered last week to plead guilty if references to sexual contact were removed. If convicted, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> could receive up to six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. A <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> TV station on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that showed <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> apparently offering a government job to the girl's mother after she asked him why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> he did not know her daughter was a teen-ager, according to the tape, made by <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> at a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> fast-food restaurant. The four-term congressman has vowed to serve out his term, which expires in 1990. Last week, a 35-year-old sexual molestation case allegedly involving <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was reported by <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> TV station <ORGANIZATION> WJBK </ORGANIZATION>. It reported that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, then a salesman, was arrested in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1954 on suspicion he had molested a girl. The station, citing unidentified police sources, said the case was dropped because the child's parents refused to press charges. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said only that there was no case.

 This community deep in the rugged Appalachian coal fields wants to use its bloody past to bring in tourists. `` We can do the same kind of thing that Tombstone's -LRB- <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> -RRB- done,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullen </PERSON>, whose town this weekend marked the anniversary of a fatal 1920 shootout between miners' union sympathizers and coal company guards. This town near where <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> meet also was in the middle in the late 1800s when the Hatfields and the McCoys began their feud. Tombstone is known for the gunfight at the OK Corral, won by <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> and his brothers. `` What happened here in history was n't pretty,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a former mayor and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. `` But it was important nationally. Frankly, I'm perplexed as to why this part of history has been neglected by the state.'' On Friday, the town of 800 marked the massacre with a talk by <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, author of `` Thunder in the Mountains,'' issued a walking tour brochure and met with state, federal and community officials to find ways to preserve the town's past. This summer, two historians from <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will spend 10 weeks in <LOCATION> Matewan </LOCATION> taping 50 oral histories, and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> will conduct a survey of the town's tourism potential. Local officials also are thinking of opening the town's first motel. `` West Virginians should be proud of their history,'' the mayor said. The body count for the 1920 shootout has not been definitively settled, but estimates place the toll at two miners, seven detectives and the mayor, all killed in a hail of gunfire along the railroad tracks behind a hardware store. Nineteen people were indicted, none convicted. A key figure, Police Chief <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> `` Two-Gun'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a descendant of clan leader <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> `` Devil Anse'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, was gunned down outside the courthouse where he was to stand trial. Until recently, `` everyone was sort of secretive'' about the Matewan Massacre, which was the subject of the 1987 movie `` Matewan,'' <PERSON> Fullen </PERSON> said. `` I guess the people involved were still here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thailand Protests Burmese Military Incursion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> today summoned the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> ambassador and protested a large-scale incursion by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops, who crossed the border during an offensive against <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels. Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops entered northern Tak province Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai forces fired artillery at the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> soldiers and killed at least six of them, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials said. The Burmese soldiers crossed the border 240 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to attack the Kaw Moo Ra rebel camp along the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, <PERSON> Thep </PERSON> <PERSON> Devakul </PERSON>, lodged the protest with Burmese Ambassador <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Swe </PERSON>, according to government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmanee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> demanded compensation for the incursion, but relations with <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> remain `` fairly cordial.'' `` We consider it serious as far as <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops coming in and violating the territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, but it was a very short period and they were actually trying to eliminate the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'' rebels, he said. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Swe </PERSON> said he told Thep he had no details from his government about the incident. He said relations between <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> `` are very good.'' In the past, the Thais have given sanctuary to <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels who have long been trying to overthrow the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government and who maintain bases along the <LOCATION> Burmese-Thai </LOCATION> border. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government last year killed hundreds of people to crush a popular uprising for democracy. After some of the student leaders of the uprising joined the rebels, the government vowed to crush the insurgency.

<HEAD>Panama Opposition Leaders Draw Cheers In Campaign-Style Tour</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s three top opposition leaders drew cheers from hundreds of workers as they toured a dozen factories today, rallying supporters in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations. `` We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one by one,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the candidate for second vice president in the May 7 election. The opposition, which international observers say won the election by a 3-1 margin, has been rallying support in this nation of 2.5 million to gain recognition of its claimed victory. The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week approved a resolution critical of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as head of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> holds real power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and called for `` a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.'' The Noriega-controlled government nullified the elections. The opposition has asked the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to help reverse that order, and the organization is sending a delegation to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday to investigate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition presidential candidate; and vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> were greeted enthusiastically today at each stop in one of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s largest industrial parks. Today was the third consecutive day the candidates rallied the opposition without interference from the government despite its ban on `` marches, meetings, public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles.'' The ban lasts until June 5, when the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation is due to report back to the organization's headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Sunday, the candidates received raucous applause from 1,000 worshipers at a church 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Saturday, the three made their first campaign-style appearances since they were assaulted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s paramilitary forces on May 10, touring a series of marketplaces in and near the capital. That tour was the opposition's first attempt to rally against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since Wednesday, when a general strike fizzled. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, are due in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday to try to promote a resolution of the crisis. The candidates on Saturday met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa. <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, leader of a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that declared the election fraudulent and <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> the winner, was in town to visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and confer with officials <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> issued another in a series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and opposition signals to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces that a coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be welcome. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is not interested in punishing the PDF,'' <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON> said. `` He is interested in dealing with the PDF. The target of our dismay is the leader of the PDF.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February 1988 but has withstood all efforts by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to have him removed. He denies the charges and says they are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to renege on its treaty to turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Court Makes Some Lawsuit Deadlines More Flexible for Prisoners in
Michigan Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today made deadlines for the filing of civil rights lawsuits by some prison inmates more flexible. The court unanimously ruled in a case from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> that states may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal suits. The justices reinstated a suit by <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, who said his rights were violated when for six months in 1980 and 1981 he was placed in solitary confinement at <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Prison. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said he became aware in July 1984 that prison rules entitled him to an administrative hearing before he was placed in solitary. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, representing himself, filed a federal suit in 1986. But the judge threw out the case on the ground that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> requires such a suit be filed within three years of the alleged injury. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today the judge also should have applied a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law which suspends the deadline for prisoners. The law permits a suit to be filed within a year after the inmate is released. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in his opinion for the high court, said suspending the deadline for inmates may be intended to help prisoneers `` loathe to bring suit against adversaries to whose daily supervision and control they remain subject.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also said inmates, as long as they remain confined, may have great difficulty proving allegations that their rights were violated. A state's decision to suspend the deadline for filing suit in such cases is consistent with federal civil rights law aimed at protecting prisoners, he said. The case is <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Straub </PERSON>, 87-7023.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to shield the Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> from being sued by two former members who say they were duped into joining it. The court also turned down an appeal by mass murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys and young men. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that religious freedom protects the church against allegations of `` brainwashing'' and fraudulent recruiting. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> told similar stories in court papers of how they became `` Moonies'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and how `` deprogramming'' led them to quit. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> was 27 when he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school in 1978 and decided to visit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Soon after arriving there in 1979, he was approached by two men at a bus stop who told him they belonged to an international community of socially conscious people. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> went to dinner with them, and later joined a group that went to a farm outside the city. He said that in the ensuing days he and others at the retreat were kept to a tight schedule of lectures, group discussions and calisthenics. He said he had no time to himself and, at least at the outset, even was accompanied to the bathroom by a group member. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> said he asked group members several times whether the organization was a religious one and was told it was not. It was not until the 12th day _ after the group arrived at another retreat called `` Camp K'' _ that he was told the group was part of the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> said he was confused and angry but decided to stay on when members convinced him that deception had been necessary because of the church's negative reputation. Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> was a 19-year-old college student when a recruiter approached her at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bus station in 1979. She said she was not told the group was part of the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> until her 22nd day at the retreat. Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> remained church members for several months before they were abducted by `` deprogrammers'' who had been hired by their parents. They are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional distress they say they suffered. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> also is seeking the return of $ 6,000 he donated to the church. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, voting 6-1 last October, overruled two lower courts and reinstated the suits. It ordered jury trials. `` <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> ... contend that by the time the church disclosed its true identity, the church's agents had rendered them incapable of deciding not to join,'' the state court said. `` They contend, in other words, that the church deceived them into a setting in which they could be ` brainwashed'.'' The state court said the former members are entitled to their day in court to prove their charges, even though no physical force was involved in the alleged brainwashing. The state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right to practice its religion freely. `` At most, it potentially closes one questionable avenue for bringing new members into the church,'' the state court said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, other religious organizations and a group consisting primarily of college professors urged the justices to overrule the state court. They said the state court ruling `` has had, and will continue to have, a serious chilling effect on religious proselytizing and conversion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere.'' In the <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> case, the justices rejected arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' death penalty law wrongly gives county prosecutors `` complete and unguided discretion to determine whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s appeal also had contended that he was denied a fair trial because the presiding judge limited the testimony of an expert psychiatric witness for the defense. In other action, the court: _ Limited federal judges' power to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials, ruling against a young <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> man who lost his arm in a car wash accident. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s product-liability lawsuit was not denied a fair trial when lawyers representing the sued manufacturer were allowed to tell jurors about <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s criminal record _ Agreed to study a federal regulation aimed at saving the government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients. The court said it will study a ruling in a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> case that struck down the regulation. _ Refused to shield <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from being sued for monetary damages in state court for allegedly allowing excessive noise and air pollution at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that court allow such lawsuits. _ Rejected an appeal by a former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> councilman convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties. The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to use the case of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> to set guidelines on when some people may challenge their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those convictions. _ Ruled that a lawsuit stemming from the terrorist hijacking of the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in 1985 may be tried in a federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Voting 9-0, the justices rejected an appeal by the ship owners aimed at transferring the suit to a court in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. _ Made deadlines for the filing of civil rights lawsuits by some prison inmates more flexible. The court unanimously ruled in a case from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> that states may give prisoners extra leeway on when they file such federal suits. The <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> case is <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON>, 88-1600.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that a lawsuit stemming from the terrorist hijacking of the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> in 1985 may be tried in a federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

A number of American passengers, including <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, sued <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON> in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON> died in 1986 and the couple's daughters, <LOCATION> Ilsa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, settled privately with <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON>. But the claims by others in the suit still are pending. The Italian ship-owning company said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts lack authority over the suit because of a provision on the passenger tickets that said any such claims must be filed in an Italian court. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the lengthy and intricate instructions on the ticket, in small print, did not give the passengers reasonable notice they were barred from suing in this country. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said, whatever the merits of that issue, the lawsuit first must go to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, writing for the court, said if <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON> loses the suit it will have an opportunity then to appeal on grounds that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> courts lacked jurisdiction. <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON> does not have the right now to appeal on that issue, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The case is <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lines </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Chasser </PERSON>, 88-23.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, ending his tour of duty in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today, said he remains encouraged by the determination of the black majority to be free despite goverment suppression. `` I think that probably is the most encouraging because it tells me that it's pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be free,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> told an airport news conference as he concluded 2 -LCB- years as the first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 60, said the most disappointing events of his tenure were the continuation of the government's state of emergency to control anti-apartheid protests, the banning of 17 activist groups and the large numbers of people who are arrested and held without charge under the government's emergency powers. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was a strong critic of such developments during his tenure. Although the embassy repeatedly condemned restrictions on the press, <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> gave no on-the-record interviews during his tenure until last week, when he talked to two South African newspapers. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is moving through a transition to a different kind of country, to one where the majority population will have a decisive say in how they are governed, to a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in which the majority will participate in and benefit from the wealth of its economy.'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> has been appointed director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to allow a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> woman whose family died in a 1983 airplane crash to sue the federal government, her city and a utility company in one federal lawsuit. By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> must sue <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a separate state court case. At issue was whether federal courts have the power to include as defendants in Federal Tort Claims Act suits against the government those whose alleged wrongdoing raise no constitutional or federal law issue. The court's majority said no. Mrs. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>'s husband and two daughters were returning home to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in a private plane on Nov. 11, 1983. On his first approach to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, the pilot was unable to land because the approach and runway lights were not visible, and he was not authorized to attempt an instrument landing. On the second approach, the plane struck electric transmission lines owned and maintained by <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. No one survived the resulting crash. Mrs. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> first sued <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and the utility in state court. She contended that the city negligently had failed to maintain the runway approach lights and that the utility negligently had placed its lines too close to the runway and failed to provide warning beacons for them. When she later discovered that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for the runway lights, Mrs. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> sued the government in federal court under the <ORGANIZATION> FTCA </ORGANIZATION>. She then asked a federal trial judge to add <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and the utility company as defendants in the federal case. The trial judge granted the request, citing `` judicial economy and efficiency.'' But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last year reversed the trial judge, ruling that the city and utility could not be included as defendants in the federal case. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said in an opinion by Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> that the appeals court was right. But Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented. The decision apparently leaves Mrs. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> free to pursue her state court suit against the city and the utility while suing the federal government in federal court. The case is Finely vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1973.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> demonstrated its ballistic missile capability today by successfully test-firing its first medium-range, surface-to-surface missile into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, officials said. The missile was fired from the seaside launch site at <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION>, 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. The 7.5-ton missile has a range capability of about 1,500 miles, sufficient to hit targets as far away as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and islands near the equator to the south, western military officials said. It can also hit any target in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars in the past 42 years. Defense experts say the missile's one-ton payload capability is more than enough to carry a nuclear warhead. The test firing was <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s third attempt at launching the Agni missile, whose name means `` fire'' in the ancient Sanskrit language. `` Agni is not a weapons system,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said in a statement issued after the launch. `` However, the technologies proved in <LOCATION> Agni </LOCATION> are deeply significant for evolving national security options.'' He said the missile accurately followed the pre-determined flight path and `` fully met the objectives we had set for it.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> did not say how far the <PERSON> Agni </PERSON> traveled during its first test-firing, and defense officials declined to comment on the matter. The missile's first firing, scheduled for April 20, was postponed by last-minute problems with the ignition system. A second launch, set for May 1, was canceled after an error in one of the rocket's sub-systems. By successfully firing the missile, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in ballistic missile capability. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Roman Popadiuk criticized the test. `` On today's test we're very concerned,'' he said. `` And in the past we've made our position very clear to the Indian government, that further proliferation of ballistic missiles in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> would be regarded as a highly destabilizing development in the region.'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said he did not know if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had communicated with the Indians on this test. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said 11,000 people living in 13 villages near the launch site were evacuated from their homes Sunday evening as a security measure. The villagers have protested the test-firing for fear the government would force them to relocate permanently if more launches are held at <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s colonia ruler, first used the site in 1893 to test ammunition. The Indians turned it into a missile test range in 1986 because of an unusual feature _ it faced the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> and during low tide the sea recedes up to two miles, enabling faster and easier recovery of shells and other short-range projectiles. The bay also has light commercial and naval traffic. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it intends to use its nuclear capacity only for peaceful purposes. Western military experts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> questioned the stance from a military standpoint, however. `` You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a conventional warhead,'' said one Western analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But if you are using a nuclear warhead, the exact target does not matter,'' he said. `` I am not saying that the Indians are going to use a nuclear warhead, but the question is why not?'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago, and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nuclear experts believe that scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in one week. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> says its nuclear program is intended for non-military purposes, such as generating power. The test firing of the intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, was only `` a technology demonstration of the country's capabilities,'' according to the government. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> previously test-fired three surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles with ranges of about 20 miles to 150 miles.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is encouraging demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to `` stand up for what you believe'' and urging the communist authorities to exercise restraint, saying he hopes pro-democracy protests do not result in bloodshed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will discuss the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> situation Tuesday in a meeting with <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who is visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was meeting today with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who once headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> were scheduled to play tennis on Tuesday as well, but the recreational interlude was canceled as `` inappropriate'' given the current unrest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said today. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security advisers are keeping him abreast of the situation. `` I would urge the government to be as forthcoming as possible in order to see more democratization and to see a peaceful resolution of this matter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We do support freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and clearly we support democracy,'' the president said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. The two leaders received honorary degrees and delivered commencement remarks at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Afterward, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came as pro-democracy students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in violation of martial law for a third day. Despite repeated rumors of an imminent military crackdown, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army had not moved to evict the protesters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1974-1975, said, `` I think this perhaps is a time for caution because we aspire to see the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people have democracy.'' He said he did not want to `` exhort in a way that is going to stir up a military confrontation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would not be appropriate for the leader of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to tell the demonstrators `` exactly what their course of action should be.'' However, he said he hoped the students would follow a peaceful course and `` continue to fight for what you believe in, stand up for what you believe in _ but beyond that I can not go.'' Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts on Sunday endorsed the moderate course pursued by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Emphasizing hopes for avoiding bloodshed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We revere the model of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in this country for his peaceful protest and so I might suggest a familiarization with that for the people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' King, an apostle of nonviolence, led the civil rights movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1950s and 1960s. He was assassinated in 1968 in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> where he was lending support to a garbage workers' strike `` I do n't want to be gratuitous in giving advice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` but I would encourage restraint. I do not want to see bloodshed.'' He said it would be `` sound advice'' for students and workers to adopt `` peaceful means of effecting change.'' `` I think that the president is saying just about all that can be said,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` We do not want to incite to riot, partly because the consequences are unforeseeable in human terms, but also partly in terms of hardheaded <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign interest,'' said <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, stressing that anarchy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be bad for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` From a foreign policy point of view, we Americans ought to consider that if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> leaves the game for a while because of domestic turmoil, it increases Soviet freedom of maneuver to a remarkable extent,'' he said. Winston Lord, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials were `` appealing to the authorities for restraint, and ... they have made clear they are on the side of the students and political reforms.'' He spoke on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Meet the Press.'' During his news conference with <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also expressed optimism that a rift within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over short-range European missiles could be bridged before next week's summit of alliance leaders. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce short-range nuclear weapons in the European theater, a step the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has been working `` behind the scenes'' to reach a consensus, and added, `` I think we could well have this resolved before the summit.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> pleaded innocent today to charges of concealing from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 1 million in profits he allegedly pocketed by selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Nicaraguan Contras. Prosecutors and defense attorneys said at <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s arraignment before <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that they will discuss whether to combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment. A hearing on the question will be held May 31. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was released on his own recognizance. The latest indictment, nine counts unsealed May 11 after the conclusion of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s criminal trial, accuses <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of obstructing the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987, perjury and making a false statement. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said he might have to withdraw from the case because `` I was privy to and was a party to discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' in connection with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s 1987 congressional testimony. Therefore, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> might be called as a witness at the trial, he said. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he would `` under those circumstances'' withdraw from the case in favor of a partner in his law firm, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who stood next to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> as he was arraigned. Prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said that `` usually the entire firm is dismissed'' as the attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomes a witness in the case. <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said `` we must explore'' propriety of the firm of Sharp, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lankford </PERSON> representing <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> pleaded innocent last year to six other criminal charges in an indictment accusing him and three others of illegally diverting more than $ 14 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. Charged with the former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general in that 1988 indictment were business partner <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide North. Conspiracy and theft charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> relating to the diversion were dropped before his trial. The former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. North enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> in 1984 to run weapons secretly to the Contras during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel force. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> carried out their work for North and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration through a network of offshore companies and Swiss bank accounts dubbed the Enterprise. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is accused of lying when he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was n't taking profits from the Enterprise In fact, said the federal grand jury indictment, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> used a former <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lawyer `` on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to the defendant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>.'' He also was accused of lying when he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that: _ His only financial gain from the arms sales to the Contras and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was his $ 6,000-a-month salary _ Half a million dollars from the Enterprise funneled to one of his companies in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> was a loan _ He was unaware any money from the Enterprise benefited <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was convicted of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> In addition, the government alleges, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> arranged to set aside $ 200,000 as a death benefit for the education of North's children.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s response to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' latest health crisis belies her claims of a stable government and shows the nervousness with which she still views her ousted predecessor. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said today her government is not strong enough to risk the return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and that even his funeral could cause trouble. She refused on Friday to allow the ailing, 71-year-old deposed president to return from Hawaiian exile and die in his homeland. She also refused to allow him to be buried here. But her national security adviser and a senator closely identified with the administration indicated today the government might allow a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> burial if his followers guarantee there would be no bid to undermine the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s caution is well-founded, considering <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters led some of the six coup attempts wthat rocked her first two years in power. But since a bloody August 1987 attempt, the government has boasted continually of its stability, pointing to two years of economic growth rates above 5 percent and numerous surveys showing Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s popularity. Government and military spokesmen claim communist rebels are losing strength and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' following has been reduced to a few thousand fanatics. `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is no longer viewed by many Filipinos as a threat to the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government,'' wrote <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> critic <PERSON> Ninez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacho-Olivares </PERSON> in the Filipino publication BusinessWorld. `` Few believe that he or his wife is capable of making a political comeback.'' Few challenge Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision to prevent <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> coming back alive. But in a society that tends to forget its leaders' past indiscretions, preventing a former president from being buried in his homeland has struck many as short-sighted and vindictive. `` One would hate to think too that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would be so stubbornly uncharitable as to turn down a dying man's last request even if, as she probably believes, the man was the single biggest cause of her widowhood,'' said the newspaper <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, which strongly opposed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was slain at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport in 1983 moments after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. After a Cabinet meeting to discuss the affair today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she feared <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers would exploit the death of the man who ruled longer than any <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president much as her own supporters used her husband's murder for political gain. `` Let's say a person has been ill for 20 years and now, after three years, he is slowly recovering,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` Just because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to expose him to infection.'' Commentator <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard: `` It is a no-win situation for President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her government. If she keeps to her frequent statements that her government is stable and beyond the reach of coups d'etat, she has no choice but to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his family to come home.'' National Security Adviser <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ileto </PERSON> told reporters today there was a chance the government might reconsider a Marcos burial. `` I do n't think that issue of forever refusing him is valid,'' <PERSON> Ileto </PERSON> said. `` It could change.'' Sen. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> said the government might allow a burial in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Ilocos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> home province if the family pledged `` that they will not use his remains as political capital, like parading him around <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> evokes deep and often contradictory emotions in an Asian society that respects authority but harbors bitter memories of eight years of martial rule. On Friday, amid reports <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might die at any time, news organizations were flooded with calls from bankers, officials and ordinary Filipinos asking if he was dead. Government officials have said privately the administration could face the specter of counter-demonstrations by both anti-Marcos leftists and pro-Marcos rightists if his body were returned. That would encourage opposition from the left and right and discourage foreign investors. Already, questions have been raised about the stability of the Aquino administration in the wake of the April 21 assassination here of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> by communist rebels. As a sign of uncertainty, share prices dropped 18 points Friday because of the rumor <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> already had died. Business sources said banks were quietly buying up dollars for fear <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death would trigger unrest and depress the Philippine peso. Selling stocks and buying dollars was a `` normal response'' to a looming political crisis, one analyst said on condition of anonymity.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said minors are free to get abortions without an adult's consent, at least until next month. That is when the court will hear arguments challenging the constitutionality of a 1988 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law requiring single girls under 18 to get permission from parents, a guardian or judge before getting abortions. The case involving a 15-year-old girl had gone all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which refused to order enforcement of the law last week. The law had previously been struck down as unconstitutional by a state appeals court. The state Attorney General's office had asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to allow the law to be enforced until the justices take up the matter. But today the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused, without comment. However, the court agreed to speed up a hearing on the law, from September to June 27. With today's ruling, `` it is our opinion that the law is unenforceable statewide,'' said Assistant Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had refused without comment Thursday to reinstate <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s abortion consent law.

<TEXT>
 The environmental movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is booming as a steady tide of bad news about the environment, culminating with the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill, has brought a surge of support to the nation's leading conservation groups In the past year, officials of these groups say, contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> rose 50 percent, the rate of membership growth at the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> doubled and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> added 700,000 new members. `` We're in the ironic situation where possibly the nation's greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing this increased interest in environmental organizations,'' Audubon spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> SanGeorge </PERSON> said `` It's a paradox.'' Although the March 24 oil spill is the most dramatic of the recent events fueling the movement's growth, it is not the only one. Environmentalists also cite last summer's <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> beach pollution and reports suggesting that air pollution is changing the Earth's climate. The oil spill, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, `` has been an important event in a series of important events that have heightened public interest.'' Although the environmentalists insist they are n't gloating over <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s misfortune, they also ca n't hide a sense of vindication. `` This spill has just really presented an opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` You hate to say, ` We told you so,' but it's a way to make a point.'' It is also a way to raise money. Several groups were quick to take advantage of the spill by sending out direct mail appeals for contributions. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest environmental group with more than 5.8 million members, established an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Fund immediately after the disaster and asked members for contributions. So far, $ 400,000 has been collected, Ms. <PERSON> Reis </PERSON> said. She said the fund will pay for research on the effects of the spill and for lobbying against oil drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, among other things. A mailing sent out by the <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> was that organization's most successful ever, according to <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the group's development director. Defenders of Wildlife, which has 80,000 members, got $ 200,000 in response to the plea, Ms. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> said. One woman sent in an unsolicited donation of about $ 1,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock. `` I think that was just indicative of how angry people are over this devastation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> said. Another group, the 285,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, has n't sent out an appeal for contributions related to the oil spill but has received about $ 50,000 in unsolicited funds, according to <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wodder </PERSON>, vice president for membership and development Other groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said it was too early to assess the impact of the oil spill on membership or contributions. Audubon has n't yet gauged the response to a plea for funds that it recently sent to 320,000 households around the nation, <PERSON> SanGeorge </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> estimates that it has been adding members at a rate of 50,000 a month since autumn and now has 1.35 million members. The Environmental Defense Fund's membership has more than doubled in the last 18 months, and now stands at more than 100,000, according to <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> and some of his colleagues are wary of the apparent change in public attitude. `` The fundamental lesson of environmental politics is that the public's interest in gains does n't always translate into workable solutions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said. For instance, he said, last summer's beach pollution with sewage and medical waste prompted legislation that stiffened penalties for polluters, but did little to reduce the sources of pollution. `` The spotlight is now focused on environmental organizations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's both a great opportunity and also a challenge. As environmentalists, we need to make sure that this support translates into real gains and not just proclamations.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Americans Favor Broad Measures To Curb Pollution</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The vast majority of Americans would accept mandatory trash recycling, higher electric bills and other inconveniences to help clean up the environment, a national poll has found. Broad perceptions exist that pollution is on the rise. The Media General and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey also found backing for initiatives ranging from a ban on household aerosol products to strict emission controls at power plants. Three-quarters of the 1,084 respondents said laws against pollution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are too weak, and about as many faulted efforts by government, businesses and average Americans to keep the environment clean. Environmental concerns were heightened by the 10 million gallon <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in March in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But the poll, conducted by telephone from May 5-13, found concern and support for action beyond oil tanker safety. Among other steps: _ Majorities favored urgent government action, no matter what the cost, to clean up toxic waste and protect drinking water. _ Eighty-one percent said new safety rules and emergency cleanup teams should be in place at all major oil facilities, even if the expense would raise the price of oil and gasoline. _ Seventy-two percent favored strict smokestack controls at oil-and coal-burning power plants, even if that would hike the price of electricity. Most respondents also supported restrictions on their own behavior. Twenty percent said their communities now require them to separate and recycle household trash; of the rest, 87 percent said they would support such a requirement. Similarly, 75 percent said they would back a ban on household aerosol products, whose propellants can pollute the air; 60 percent supported a ban on charcoal lighter fluid; and 58 percent favored a ban on non-radial tires, which release more rubber into the air than do radials. Bans on aerosol cans, lighter fluid and non-radial tires are among the measures suggested for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by a regional air quality board in March. Other steps in that proposal won less support nationally: Respondents were split on parking restrictions in cities to discourage driving, and 59 percent opposed banning gasoline-fueled garden appliances. Overall, 72 percent said pollution appears to have increased in the past decade. Nearly a quarter said they stayed away from the beach last year because of beach pollution. Concerns about the environment crossed ideological and political lines. Residents of the nation's most densely populated areas were the most apt to see anti-pollution efforts as inadequate and to favor new steps. Respondents indicated there was plenty of blame to go around. Forty-two percent said businesses are doing a poor job of keeping the environment clean and 36 percent said `` only fair,'' for a negative rating of 78 percent. Similarly, 83 percent rated the federal government's environmental record as fair or poor, as opposed to good or excellent; 71 percent gave a negative rating to their state and local governments' environmental records; and 79 percent said most Americans are doing only a fair or poor job of keeping the environment clean The highest environmental priority was toxic waste disposal, in which 63 percent supported urgent government action regardless of the expense. Next was the related issue of pollution of the nation's drinking water, with 52 percent favoring urgent action, cost aside. For those and other environmental problems, the poll gave the choices of `` urgent government action no matter what the cost, prompt government action, limited government action or no government action.'' Urgent or prompt action were favored overwhelmingly, by 72 percent or more in every instance. Responses were split on one current issue, whether the federal government should issue new offshore oil drilling permits. Forty-five percent opposed new drilling off the coasts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while about 35 percent favored new drilling there and 20 percent were unsure. Opposition was greater to oil drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Sixty percent were opposed and only about a quarter were in favor, with the rest unsure. The poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points, was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 2,500 miners from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s last two coal pits demonstrated Monday against plans to close the mines ahead of schedule. The peaceful march contrasted sharply with last month's demonstration in the northeastern mining region of <LOCATION> Limburg </LOCATION>, when police had to fire shots in the air to keep the miners at bay Twenty-eight police were injured. The management of the coal mines wants the pits closed before the scheduled date of 1996, arguing that government subsidies to keep them open can be better used to create reconversion industries. The regional government of <LOCATION> Flanders </LOCATION> is to discuss the issue Friday. Miners want to keep production going as long as possible. An early closure also would endanger their benefits. Two years ago, management closed three mines and cut the workforce of 18,000 in half.

 Doctors in the Angolan capital of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> are reporting more than 100 new cases of cholera daily in an epidemic that has claimed dozens of lives, a newspaper reported Monday. Angolan health officials have not released a death toll for the epidemic but foreign doctors in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> are reporting between 100 and 150 new cases every day, according to the state-owned Portuguese daily <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>. The paper said dozens have died in the past two weeks from the disease, an acute intestinal infection. Angolan health authorities have launched a media campaign advising <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million people to boil water before drinking, wash their hands before preparing food and avoid eating seafood, raw fruit and vegetables, the paper said. Officials said the cholera that often surges in May's hot and humid rainy season was spreading rapidly due to poor water supplies, drainage and general pollution in the city.

 Cruising for democracy has come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The one-month old movement for more personal freedom and clean government has involved hundreds of thousands of students, workers and journalists. Now they've been joined by bikers. A pack of motorcycle riders has been roaring up and down central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main streets the past week in support of students fasting in central Tiananmen Square for democracy. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> branch of the `` Wild Bunch'' kicked into gear with about 75 motorcyclists and grew to nearly 400 by Saturday, when students in the square were expecting the army would try to force them out. Many of the people who brought gauze and surgical masks Saturday night as a precaution against tear gas wound up covering up for protection from the plumes of exhaust from the cycles. Several cyclists rode with their fashionably dressed girlfriends perched on the back. They waved Chinese national flags and banners with anti-corruption slogans as they sped by. At least one swilled beer as he careened around the square. The cyclists seemed to have the most fun late at night, roaring down the avenue in front of <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>, the compound where the country's leaders work and live, honking horns and revving motors to make sure their presence was known.

 Students protesting for democracy have shown a fondness for bureaucracy and the trappings of power, two things they supposedly are fighting. For much of the past week, one could barely walk through the student-occupied Tiananmen Square for more than a minute without being told the territory that lay ahead was out of bounds. `` You ca n't go in there,'' was a familiar refrain from countless students armed with nothing more than an air of self-importance. Student leaders issued passes to some reporters that supposedly allowed access around the square. But even they were met with the response: `` I'm sorry, but those passes are temporarily ineffective.'' Meanwhile, other students waved flags, blew whistles, displayed impressive hand signals and constantly barked orders in trying to direct the chaotic traffic in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> created by the Tiananmen protest. Despite their best efforts, however, traffic remained impossible.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers deployed in the outskirts have spent much of the past few days meeting the citizens of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, who have swarmed around the military convoys to prevent them from taking action against protesting students. The people and the military generally appear to get along. The people have offered the soldiers popsicles and squash to eat, newspapers to read and lectures on democracy to mull over. The troops, in return, have chatted with the masses and entertained them with an occassional song. One revolutionary blast from the past sung by troops to hearty applause was `` Learn from Comrade Lei Feng.'' The song is a tribute to a perhaps mythical soldier offered for emulation years ago as a keen student of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s works. Comrade Lei, so the story goes, died when he was beaned by a falling telephone pole.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party leader of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> has acknowledged he was too rash in firing a popular, daring newspaper editor whose dismissal angered journalists nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> `` welcomed everyone's criticism,'' but also denied reports that he was criticized by the national party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> did not say if he was willing to reinstate <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>, editor in chief of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Women's News carried <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s comments in its Friday edition, which was not delivered until Monday. Mass protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> against the government's hard-line attitude toward student demonstrators have disrupted delivery of mail and newspapers. Some newspapers also have missed editions since Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared martial law Saturday. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> authorities fired <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> after he refused to alter the paper's April 24 edition and accused him of repeated `` violations of discipline.'' The edition contained calls for a reassessment of party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, whose death April 15 triggered student protests that led to the mass marches. Hu was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier student protests. After dismissing <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> authorities set up a special committee to `` rectify'' and supervise the paper. However, its lower-level editors and reporters have continued to express defiance and try to publish controversial articles, and officials have halted and revised two editions since. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>'s dismissal prompted journalists in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to join the student protests. More than 1,000 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> reporters signed a petition demanding a dialogue on censorship, and thousands marched last week in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. It is the first time journalists for the tightly controlled official media, many of whom are party members, have rebelled openly and in such large numbers. They said they were embarrassed that many Chinese had to get news on events in their own country from foreign short-wave radio broadcasts such as the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Datong </PERSON>, an editor at the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> who organized the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> reporters' petition, said he thought it was possible <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> could be reinstated if enough people kept pressuring <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials. Chinese sources said last week that <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> offered to reinstate <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> if he wrote a self-criticism of his actions and the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to attack <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> or the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> city government.

<HEAD>Expulsion of Workers May Cause Problems for Families, Employers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to expel thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> workers could cause financial hardship for their families in the occupied lands and harm the businesses that employed them. About 50,000 workers from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were ordered home last week. Many hold low-paying jobs in construction, textiles, restaurants, street cleaning and garbage collection. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say workers from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> will be allowed to return only with special permits and the system probably will be applied later to the 60,000 workers from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Government officials said the purpose was to punish Palestinians for the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Criiticism came from within the government and from liberal legislators. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, finance minister and deputy prime minister, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> expelling workers would cause economic problems for Palestinians that would inflame the uprising. `` We are pushing them into a corner from which there will be more bitterness and resistance,'' he said. Worried businessmen say their industries will suffer unless replacements are found quickly and have appealed for permission to hire workers abroad. Palestinians expressed concern that delays in issuing the new permits might cost them their jobs. <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitteh </PERSON>, an economist from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, described the action as `` the ugliest means of collective punishment.'' Annual per capita income in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> is equivalent to less than $ 750 and people have little in savings, he said. `` They depend on daily work,'' the economist said. `` They can not finance themselves if they do n't work.'' The 110,000 Palestinians who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are breadwinners for many of the 1.7 million who live in the territories, bringing home an estimated $ 700 million a year. They will find few jobs at home because little industrial development has taken place during 22 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. A study in 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of `` a deliberate and consistent policy aimed at keeping the territories as a dumping ground for Israeli industrial products and as a pool of cheap labor.'' Those who run industries dependent on unskilled <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> workers say they will have trouble finding replacements because Israelis do not want the jobs. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Polgat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textiles </ORGANIZATION>, said his company had employed about 130 Gazans and was hard-pressed to find substitutes. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapir </PERSON>, director of the construction industry's <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, described the loss of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers as `` catastrophic'' and said `` the immediate solution is to bring foreign workers'' to replace them So far, the government has opposed importing workers because 112,000 Israelis are unemployed. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> made clear the new policies are intended to punish the Palestinians. `` We started two or three months ago to look for measures that will make it clear to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, later on in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, that the right to leave the territories is a privilege,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said there must be `` a certain balance between their freedom to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and their participation in violence and terror.'' He has the support of many Israelis angered by the government's inability to crush the uprising. One place feelings are especially strong is <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, a coastal city north of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The body of a soldier the government said was killed by Palestinians was found near <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>. A missing soldier believed kidnapped by Palestinians, is from the city. `` We should n't let them work here anymore. Thy kill our children,'' said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Attias </PERSON>, 57, who has overseen Palestinian sanitation crews in <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> for two decades. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a parliament member from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, described the government action as `` stupid, unjust, ineffective and immoral.'' He accused <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of playing into the hands of radical Israelis who want to expel all Palestinians. `` By sending back the inhabitants of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in a way which reminds me of South African methods, I believe he gives legitimacy to all the transferists everywhere,'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews May 5-13 with 1,084 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon.

<HEAD>Pravda Accuses Baltic Fronts of Going Overboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Popular movements in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republics </ORGANIZATION> are going too far in demanding greater independence and backing programs that amount to complete secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Grassroots groups in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> are issuing demands that are extremist and even nationalist, the newspaper said. Referring to resolutions passed at a mid-May assembly of Baltic popular movements in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, Pravda said: `` In total, although no one talks about this directly, they make sense only if their authors have in mind the complete secession of the three republics from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The Baltic assembly stopped short of endorsing secession, but many members of the Estonian and <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fronts </ORGANIZATION> and the Lithuanian movement Sajudis openly espouse complete secession. The Pravda article came three days before the opening of a new national parliament at which at least one Baltic delegation, the Lithuanians, have threatened to walk out if their desires are ignored. `` We think Uzbeks or Russians do n't understand our problems,'' said <PERSON> Alfredas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smailys </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> delegate to the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies from <LOCATION> Kaunas </LOCATION>. `` We demand the right of veto. If, however, our protest is not taken into account, we're prepared to leave the hall.'' A deputy from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vooglaid </PERSON>, would not specify what tactics the Estonians will use, but he said the delegation `` will not retreat'' from the platform worked out at the Baltic assembly. Baltic nationalists issued a call May 14 for `` economic independence'' from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by next year. Sixty-one deputies who belong to the popular movements also hammered out a joint platform asserting the right of the country's 15 republics to set their own policies. Last week, the Baltic popular movements saw some of their economic proposals approved by the Estonian and Lithuanian parliaments. They passed measures taking virtually all control over local industry away from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as of 1990. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s economic law includes provision for printing its own money, and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s would allow limited private property. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Thurday also duplicated <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s `` declaration of sovereignty'' and claimed veto power over Soviet laws on its territory. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> proclaimed <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s sovereignty law was invalid last fall, but <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> still considers it in force and neither side has forced a showdown.

 The movement for political change grew from a tiny student poster campaign to a mass call for the removal of top Chinese leaders in five weeks of unprecedented high drama. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership could hardly have seen the trouble awaiting them when former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a relatively liberal leader who was ousted in a crackdown on a previous round of student demonstrations, died of a heart attack April 15. Within hours of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death, posters sprang up at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> University praising him and indirectly criticing the leaders who forced him to resign two years earlier. The students held several demonstrations during the following week to press demands for democratic reform, a free press and clean government. Events surrounding <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s April 22 funeral set the tone for the following month of protest, with students fearlessly defying security forces. Up to 100,000 people gathered in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square April 21 to mourn <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> and stayed overnight, refusing to follow police orders to disperse. Top officials going to a memorial for Hu the following day at the adjacent Great Hall of the People peered across a protective wall of thousands of soldiers to view fist-waving citizens demanding an end to what they called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dictatorship. The broad support the student movement was winning from workers and others became obvious a week later, when tens of thousands of people lined the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to cheer about 150,000 students marching for democracy. Along the route, enthusiastic onlookers gave the marchers money, food and water. Enthusiastic crowds again appeared the following week, when students marched to mark the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement for democracy. But the campaign seemed to falter after the march ended, as leaders argued over what tactics to take to press their demands. While students at most colleges in the capital ended a two-week class boycott, <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students kept up the heat, refusing to return to their classrooms and demanding more action. About 3,500 students, many from the nation's most prestigious schools, decided to press their demands by staging a hunger strike at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> beginning May 13, two days before the arrival of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to normalize ties after 30 years of icy relations. The government urged the students to end the strike before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival so as not to spoil the nation's image. Students hotly debated what to do in the pre-dawn hours of May 15 before deciding to continue their fast, forcing several changes in the Soviet leader's schedule that embarrassed the government. As the fasting students' health began to deteriorate, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents grew increasingly miffed at the government's failure to meet the hunger strikers' demands of dialogue with officials and a retraction of an editorial that called the movement a `` disturbance.'' In the largest protest of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history, well over 1 million people poured into downtown <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Wednesday in support of the hunger strikers. Many called for the resignation of Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, viewed as a conservative, and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. Demonstrations were reported in at least two dozen other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. Another mass protest the next day was answered by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> with a hard-line speech and the declaration of martial law in much of the capital. Throngs of workers rushing to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> to protect the students yelled, `` <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, step down!'' and said his retirement was the only way the demonstrations would end. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a relative liberal sympathetic with many grievances raised by demonstrators, reportedly has offered to resign, although there has been no official announcement. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s future also seems uncertain, as he faces virtually universal condemnation from the people of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has not appeared publicly or been quoted by official media since he met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on May 16.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> reviewed the military situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> today without broaching any requests for new weapons deals, defense officials said. The officials, who asked not to be named, said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> met privately and with other officials for more than an hour at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> offering the newly installed <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> a progress report on the overall situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> did not discuss `` in any detail'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest regional peace initiative, the sources said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are expected to delve more deeply into that issue during White House talks on Tuesday. The Pentagon, in a prepared statement, described today's talks as `` upbeat -LRB- and -RRB- friendly.'' `` Most of the time was spent talking about the current status of the military situation in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> identified the most significant recent development in the region as the end of the Iran-Iraq war.'' The defense sources said <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> had declined to predict for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> what the current cease-fire in that war would mean to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Basically, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he did n't know what the cease-fire would mean or whether it would hold,'' said one official. `` He told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> the war had dominated the region for the past decade. He also said despite the cease-fire, the arms race in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> goes on.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, after more than eight years of fighting, agreed to a cease-fire last August. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in its statement that <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> `` expressed the hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to support <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> indicated that we will do our best within the constraints of the budget to continue our current level of support to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The Israeli defense chief, however, `` did not get specific about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support and did not press for any new arms deals or discuss specific weapons,'' added one source. `` This meet was very low key,'' the official said. `` Neither side asked the other for anything.'' The meeting ended with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> extending an invitation to <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The secretary accepted the invitation without committing to a specific date, the sources said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said today <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> would meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s controversial proposal for Palestinian elections. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he supports the idea of elections as a way to get the peace process underway. The plan calls for voting to chose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to negotiate self-rule for the 1.5 million residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Negotiations on a permanent solution would start after three years. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan, and other <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> critics say it fails to deal with Palestinian aspirations for an independent state.

<HEAD>Court Limits Scope of `Discreditation' Decree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that citizens may not be thrown in jail for expressing truthful criticism of officials, limiting the scope of a new decree widely criticized by reformers and dissidents alike. The court reviewed a decree passed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on April 8 because citizens already have been arrested under differing interpretations of the law, according to a report distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Critics charged that a provision of the decree banning discrediting officials and government bodies was written in such a way that a person could be prosecuted for telling the unpleasant truth. <PERSON> Alvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Juozaidis </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s grassroots Sajudis organization, called the decree `` pure Stalinism.'' Among its other critics were human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. Some opponents have called for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the new parliament that meets for the first time Thursday, to overturn the law The court said, `` Well-founded, argumentative criticism of the action and decisions of these organs and officials by citizens, acting publicly in the framework of socialist law, can not be viewed as a criminally punishable act.'' The court's action, taken as President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seeks to strengthen the role of law in Soviet society, constituted one of the rare times the court has acted to ensure a controversial measure is applied consistently. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> instructed lower courts the decree touched only `` intentional public distribution of slanderous inventions'' that undermines faith in officials. It said that the decree did not include `` dispatches in the press and any other form of information reflecting insufficiencies in the activity of these organs, social organizations and officials.'' The court said its declaration was a balance between protecting officials from insults and slander, and protecting the rights of individuals to express their views. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say how many criminal cases have been filed on the basis of the new law nor did it address any of them in detail. But it said that in the month and a half since the decree was published, differences in interpretation already had come to light. Soviet officials have said that the new decree is more specific and less subject to abuse than Articles 70 and 190 of the criminal code that for years have banned `` anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'' and `` anti-Soviet slander.'' Politically controled courts used those laws for years to imprison dissidents. Last year the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it intended to radically alter those laws. It stopped arresting people under them, and in the past two years has released hundreds of people arrested under them. But dissidents and reformers alike reacted angrily to the decree, claiming the provision against discrediting officials actually was worse than the previous law. The law also bans public calls to overthrow the government, and `` premeditated'' acts aimed at inciting national or racial animosity. In other action that also expressed its desire to right the legal abuses of the past, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> continued its rehabiliation who were unlawfully convicted of anti-Soviet activity in the 1930s through the 1960s. Those rehabiliated Monday included former midlevel officials who were accused under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> of being German spies or taking part in a conspiracy to kill the popular <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirov </PERSON> in 1934. A Latvian poet, K.E. <PERSON> Skueniek </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1962 of anti-Soviet agitation, also was cleared.

 Bribery charges were filed against two leading politicians in the Recruit influence-buying case Monday, but critics said prosecutors had not dug deeply enough into the scandal, which has shaken politics and business. Those charged were <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former cabinet minister and member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, former secretary-general of the opposition Komeito -LRB- Clean Government -RRB- Party. If convicted, they could be imprisoned for up to seven years. <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, 56, and <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, 52, were not taken into custody. Japanese law protects members from being jailed while <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is in session unless the legislative body grants permission. They are widely expected to be the only politicians charged, although 17 legislators or aides are known to have received bargain unlested shares of stock from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Thirteen are from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, including 11 members of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> said he `` received the news of the charges solemnly'' and wished to apologize to the Japanese people. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> received donations and heavily discounted stock shares from Recruit in exchange for using political influence to help the information conglomerate's magazine publishing business. All 14 others arrested or charged in the Recruit scandal were bureaucrats or businessmen. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON>, a former journalist and four-term member of the lower house, said the charges were `` a fabrication of reality'' and he would prove his innocence in court. He announced last week he would resign from both <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the Buddhist-affiliated <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ichikawa </PERSON>, current secretary-general of the party, said it was `` extremely regrettable'' that charges had been filed against a member, but added that prosecutors should carry the investigation further. Actions taken to date `` are n't enough to clarify and get to the core of the scandal,'' he said. `` If the investigation ends now, it will have failed to reach the people who were most responsible.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said last month he would resign to take responsibility for the scandal, which has eroded public trust in politics. The governing party's search for a successor has been complicated by the scandal's links to most of its senior members. <PERSON> Ichikawa </PERSON> and other opposition party leaders said they would continue pressing for a full investigation. <PERSON> Eiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations, said Monday all members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who received Recruit shares should resign, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, the chief government spokesman in <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s Cabinet and an eight-term member of the lower house, was considered a rising star in the party. He submitted his resignation to the party Monday but said he would retain his parliament seat. He has acknowledged that an aide bought 12,000 shares of stock in a Recruit subsidiary at a discounted price in 1986, then made a profit of about 30 million yen -LRB- $ 215,000 -RRB- when the stock went on public sale. News reports say <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> used some of the profit to buy a house in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The former labor minister also is said to have received about 90 million yen -LRB- $ 640,000 -RRB- in political donations from Recruit. <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> has admitted his brother bought 5,000 shares of stock in the Recruit subsidiary and made a profit of about 10 million yen -LRB- $ 71,000 -RRB-. Reports also say <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> received 14 million yen -LRB- $ 100,000 -RRB- in donations from Recruit. Both politicians have denied personal involvement in the stock transactions, but some of the profits allegedly were deposited in their bank accounts. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON> used political influence to persuade officials to continue a `` gentlemen's agreement'' among government agencies and private companies on a uniform date for hiring of graduating college students. Recruit considered the agreement critical to the sales of its employment magazines. With the filing of charges against <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, prosecutors said their bribery investigation was complete and they would focus on illegal donations made by the conglomerate, news reports said. Japanese law restricts a company of Recruit's size to 15 million yen -LRB- $ 107,000 -RRB- a year in political donations. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> alone has acknowledged receiving more than 130 million yen -LRB- about $ 1 million -RRB- from Recruit in 1985-87.

<HEAD>Party Supports Gorbachev for President, Sakharov Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Monday endorsed <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to be chosen again for the post of Soviet president when the new parliament convenes for the first time later this week. At a separate meeting of deputies to the congress, human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> also endorsed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but with reservations. `` My position is that we have no leader except for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But he is not immaculate, not immaculate in terms of a very large number of actions,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said in a speech. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met to discuss the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which will meet Thursday. Among the duties of the new <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> are to elect the president and a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet legislature. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Central Committee recommended election of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as Soviet president. He was elected president Oct. 1 by the old <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which is being replaced by the congress and the new Supreme Soviet it will elect. The 251-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's policy-making body, had been expected to meet prior to the congress to set its approach to the stronger legislative branch being formed as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attempts to strengthen the Soviet government. Many questions of the congress' exact functions have not been clarified yet, just days before it meets. The vast majority of deputies are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but there is a large block of reformers who are impatient with progress so far implementing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Many of them, especially radicals from the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, can not be counted on to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s dictates. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> firebrand <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and others told a rally that they had formed their own program of radical changes that includes urgent action to heal the economy and multicandidate elections for the presidency. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the rally that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies had drafted an agenda that demands `` radical decisions on the economy, social justice and glasnost.'' The deputies are demanding laws on pensions, children's rights and property, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was among 34 speakers Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, but it provided no details of his remarks. One deputy, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoukhov </PERSON>, told the Sunday gathering that <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> should be elected president. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has denied in the past that he is interested in challenging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and no clear opposition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has formed. On Monday, scores of deputies signed a letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, backing a draft agenda by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies. The agenda calls on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make a report to the congress on the state of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before the election for president is held. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, speaking at the deputies' meeting, said: `` I think we have no other real candidate than <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' `` Compared to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the candidacy of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> would be unsatisfactory,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s mistakes must be `` corrected by the people's will,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. In the past, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has criticized policy on ethnic relations and government decisions that he sees as limiting its commitment to free expression. The congress consists of 2,250 members, 1,500 chosen on the basis of geographical representation and 750 chosen from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliates, social, professional and trade union organizations. The party itself has 100 seats, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was elected a deputy of the congress from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T's Largest Union Authorizes Strike; Saturday is Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's largest union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached by midnight Saturday, the union said Monday as negotiations entered a critical stage. The <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which reprsents about 130,000 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T workers, did not release a breakdown of its nationwide strike-authorization vote. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which is negotiating jointly with <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and represents an additional 40,000 employees, is conducting a separate vote. Strike authorization is expected. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts with the two unions expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. A company spokesman said he was hopeful a new, three-year agreement would be reached this week and there were indications the unions might not immediately call a strike even if the two sides remained far apart at the deadline. `` It is routine for the rank-and-file union members to give the leadership such authorization,'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. `` It does n't mean there will be a strike. We look forward to a hard week, a challenging week of bargaining and are still optimistic that a settlement can be reached with the unions without a work stoppage.'' A <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> statement stressed that a strike `` is only one of several tactics to achieve a fair contract.'' Among those tactics is a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance service, a move the unions say will cost the company upwards of $ 10 million a month The boycott plan calls for the nation's unions and related organizations, which predominately are <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T customers, to temporarily switch their long-distance calls to non-union <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. The unions and the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> also have said they will urge their major suppliers to boycott <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T as well. If <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and its unions appear close to an agreement, the unions likely would agree to negotiate for a day or two past the contract's expiration. If, on the other hand, the two sides remain far apart, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> have the power to decide whether to strike immediately or to implement the boycott plan in hopes of pressuring <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T into concessions. Although negotiators have been meeting since March, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has yet to present a formal offer. That should come early this week. Union officials have said the two sides remain far apart on three major issues: employee contributions to health insurance, pay and job security. `` At this stage, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has yet to seriously address issues of concern to our members, particularly the issue of employment security,'' <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said. `` Management is pushing a package of sweeping, unacceptable medical cuts and other proposals which attack seniority.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> issued a statement promising unity among the unions, which were bitter rivals at this stage of contract talks three years ago. `` Together our members are determined to win jobs with justice and a contract worthy of the skills and productivity of our members,'' he said. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> struck <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for 26 days but the company was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants open because the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> agreed to work provided its members were given any added benefits <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> won through its strike.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general facing new charges in the Iran-Contra affair, pleaded innocent Monday to charges of covering up his alleged profits from selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was released on his own recognizance after being arraigned before <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. Prosecutors and defense attorneys said they will discuss whether to combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. They will report back to the court May 31. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, meanwhile, that he expects the trials of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, once presidential national security adviser, to begin simultaneously. The judge said it would be impossible for him to handle both Iran-Contra cases, which probably will be tried this fall. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is handling pre-trial proceedings in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>; <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>; <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> were charged in 1988 with illegally diverting more than $ 14 million in Iranian arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. Prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has `` every intention'' of prosecuting <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> after <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s trail. The latest indictment against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> accuses him of obstructing the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987, perjury and making false statements. The nine counts were unsealed May 11 after <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial ended. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he might have to withdraw from the case because `` I was privy to and was a party to discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' in connection with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s 1987 congressional testimony. Therefore, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said, he might be called as a witness at the trial. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he would, `` under those circumstances,'' withdraw from the case in favor of a partner in his law firm, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who stood next to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> as he was arraigned. <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said that `` usually the entire firm is dismissed'' as the attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomes a witness in the case. <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said `` we must explore'' whether anyone in the firm of Sharp, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lankford </PERSON> should represent <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is accused of lying when he told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was n't taking profits from his network of foreign corporations and Swiss bank accounts, part of an operation that became known as the Enterprise In fact, said the federal grand jury indictment, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> used a former <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lawyer `` on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to the defendant, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>.'' He also was accused of lying when he testified that his only financial gain from the arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Contras was his $ 6,000-a-month salary; that $ 500,000 from the Enterprise funneled to one of his companies was a loan, and that he was unaware any money from the Enterprise benefited North. North was convicted earlier this month of three criminal charges in the Iran-Contra affair, including illegally accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. In addition, the government alleges, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> arranged to set aside $ 200,000 as a death benefit for the education of North's children. North called on <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to secretly run weapons to the Contras during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel force and to assist in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said today a study of 19 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campuses found that two out of every 1,000 students tested was infected with the AIDS virus, a rate below the national average but a figure one official said `` should cause real concern.'' Officials said the study points up the need for more aggressive efforts to prevent the spread of the deadly virus on college campuses. The study _ the nation's first survey attempting to determine the prevalence of AIDS among college students _ tested the blood of 16,861 students who sought medical attention in their campus health centers. Of those, 30 tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which amounts to an overall infection rate of 0.2 percent, said the association, which conducted the study with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No student tested positive at 10 of the schools, while five of the schools had rates of 0.4 percent or higher. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON>, director of student health services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> and president of the college health association, said the survey results `` establish beyond any doubt that HIV infection is a current problem on college campuses.'' He said `` the fact that HIV infection appears on campuses across the country should cause real concern.'' By comparison, studies have indicated that the infection rate among prisoners is four out of 1,000, or 0.4 percent. Nationwide, researchers believe 1 million to 1.5 million people are infected, a rate of 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said the overall 0.2 percent rate is `` somewhat higher than we hypothesized at the outset,'' but he added that `` these numbers are meant to be indicators, rather than statements of specific levels of infection.'' <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> who worked on the survey, said the prevalence of infection appears to be about the same for college students as for other groups where they would not expect to see an extremely high rate. She said, for example, studies have shown a rate of infection among military recruits of 0.14 percent. At a news conference, <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said that of the 30 students who tested positive 28 were male and two were female. He said he had no breakdown of the number of men and women whose blood was tested as part of a study. They also had no breakdown on the age of students in the study. He said the highest campus rate was 0.9 percent but the study did not identify rates for individual campuses. <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said his advice to college students is that `` uninformed, unprotected, unsober sexual activity is highly risky.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious, fatal isease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. The 19 campuses, comprising 18 public and private institutions, were selected to represent a cross section of higher education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the association said. However, the association picked only large universities because they tend to attract students from their geographic areas. Also, the survey was restricted to students who had routine blood tests done at their student health centers. The testing was done anonymously, and results were not broken out for the individual schools. The association said it will continue the study during the next academic year and wants include several more schools, including historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> institutions and some with predominantly Hispanic students. The schools included in the survey were: Central Missouri State University-Warrensburg; <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Starkville </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Carbondale </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Boulder </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut-Storrs </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Athens </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas-Lawrence </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts-Amherst </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire-Durham </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas-Austin </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington-Seattle </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s best regional museums that was destroyed by German bombers and paved over as a parking lot will be the focus of an unusual archaeological dig this year. The city of <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> opened the site of the old <ORGANIZATION> Hull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> to the public Monday, turning it into a kind of retrospective of the 1940s, with extracts from war broadcasts and popular songs piped into the dig, said project coordinator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. The six-month dig was organized by civic officials, assisted by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> museum, to save what is left of a once-fine historical collection. The neoclassical museum collapsed in an inferno of German incendiary bombs in 1943 and was left in ruins for several years until, for safety reasons, it was flattened and turned into a parking lot, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` For all the world it looked like any other car park,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, the principal keeper of museums in the coastal city on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` But when we put in a ditch in 1988, we realized a high proportion of the collection had survived intact although it was very badly damaged.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said in an interview it was hoped the dig would not only save the treasures, but reveal how some objects, especially those made from modern materials, decay in soil. The collections ranged from fossils and Roman coins to the largest prehistoric boat found in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and objects made from nylon and rayon, which were new materials at the time, he said. `` It is bizarre,'' he said. `` We're not talking about a normal archaeological site. We're trying to piece together a moment in time: June 23, 1943.'' The site `` was related to people alive here. There's a great emotional relationship in <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> to this dig,'' he said. Financial support for the $ 192,000 project has also come from the state-funded National Heritage Memorial Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Heafitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, he said. City officials had n't excavated in the post-war years because <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> had been bombed heavily. `` There was a lot of rebuilding to do,'' he said. `` It was just something put to the back of people's minds. Some of the treasures were lost before the rubble was cleared. `` We do n't really like to call it looting. ... It was hard to know the mentality at the time, and it looked to be totally abandoned,'' he said, adding that the extent of the losses was unknown and most museum records were destroyed. After the dig, any treasures salvaged will be housed at one of the city's other museums, said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>.

<HEAD>NATO Leaders Seek to Mend Dispute Over Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One week before the big <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit begins, officials are still scrambling to mend a rift between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many of its European allies over short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The disagreement may not be completely settled by the time President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other alliance leaders gather May 29-30 in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But reassuring words by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> suggest the issue wo n't be allowed to disrupt the summit _ at least on the surface. It's a much bigger issue in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where feelings on European-based nuclear weapons run sharp and deep, than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Even in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, however, one diplomat, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said, `` There will be something to paper over the differences so we can emerge reasonably united from the summit.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieldhouse </PERSON>, a research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, said the issue has become `` too steamed up,'' making it difficult to find a solution. `` There's a bit too much enmity. ... There's a lot of political maneuvering and a lot of bad blood politically,'' he said. But <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Binnendijk </PERSON>, director of studies for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, predicted a way would be found to narrow the split in time for the anniversary gathering. `` It is clear that -LRB- <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do n't want to see this thing blow up at the summit,'' he said. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the dispute was a `` vexing question'' with differing opinions by `` strong-willed people from strong countries.'' However, he also said `` I think great progress has been made'' and `` I think that we could well have this resolved before the summit.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said, `` On this problem, like on other problems, at the outset people have diverging views, differing opinions. But the important thing is to come to a meeting of the minds and to achieve a common answer. And this has always been the case in the alliance.'' The dispute stems from a push by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to replace the aging Lance surface-to-surface nuclear missile with a new, more powerful weapon. The arms campaign has become increasingly unpopular in many <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, upbeat about the friendlier moves by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and reluctant to do anything to cool the warmer East-West climate. `` Continental Europeans are really not interested in another round of nuclear modernization,'' said <PERSON> Fieldhouse </PERSON>. Politicians, he said, will have `` a hard time trying to convince the public it's necessary.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had hoped for a strong signal of support from the allies for the Lance modernization program. But that now appears highly unlikely. German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, worried about the survival of his center-right government, wants to delay a decision on production of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after important elections next year in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Moreover, his government unexpectedly demanded that the alliance enter into early negotiations with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to reduce short-range, or theater nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have strongly opposed that, arguing the emphasis should be on East-West bargaining to slash conventional, or non-nuclear, arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials worry that opening discussions on reducing short-range nuclear weapons would inevitably lead to removal of all those forces from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> contends it maintains a nuclear stockpile as a deterrent to balance the enormous superiority the East has built up in conventional arms. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has gained support for its position _ although with varying degrees of enthusiasm _ from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has tried to add more pressure on the Western allies. He recently promised to unilaterally withdraw 500 short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this year. According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has 1,450 short-range nuclear missile launchers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has 88 Lance launchers, most based in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In their meetings, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials have been trying to find acceptable language on the weapons issue to write into the Comprehensive Concept, a blueprint for alliance strategy in arms control and force planning. The roadmap, which will be presented to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other leaders at the summit, lacks only a section on the allies' stand on short-range nuclear forces. A number of possibilities are still on the table but no compromise solution has yet emerged, officials say. The European diplomat suggested the officials may signal their willingness to enter into negotiations with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact on reducing theater nuclear weapons _ but not now. Discussions would hinge on progress in newly opened East-West talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on slashing conventional forces _ a position <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has publicly embraced. The officials, though, could put off a decision altogether, perhaps bumping the issue to a commission, which would report its findings to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials by a certain later. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to go ahead with research and development for a replacement to the Lance missile. Military analysts say it will be obsolete by 1995. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members are: <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, ended his tour of duty Monday with a salute to the country's blacks. `` It's pretty difficult to stifle the desire of people to be free,'' he said. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> gave his first news conference in 2 -LCB- years in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> just before boarding a plane to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is expected to become director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The most encouraging -LRB- thing -RRB- has been to see the reaction of the black majority to the efforts of the government to stifle overt unhappiness with the status quo,'' he said. `` While the government has been fairly successful in many cases with the state of emergency, I think the black majority seem even more determined, even stronger in making a difference.'' The 60-year-old <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> native said he was most disappointed by `` the continued existence of the state of emergency, the banning of 17 organizations a couple of years ago and the inclination to arrest a lot of people and detain them without charge.'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> consistently has criticized such practices. He also attended political trials and protest services and traveled extensively, visiting some of the poorest and most militant black communities. However, he made only a handful of public speeches and until last week gave no news interviews. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be, and intends to remain, engaged in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said. `` We must steadfastly manifest what we believe in as a nation so that our message is heard and understood all over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in every village and in every township. `` We do not wish to impose an ideology, but we do want to express our belief in human rights, the rule of law, equal justice under law, and equal participation in government under a constitution which has been decided by representatives of a majority of South Africans.'' His departure comes as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government prepares for a visit from <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, designated the next president of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and just after a meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and clergymen who favor more economic sanctions to pressure <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to end apartheid. Sanctions have been a major issue during <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' ambassadorship, which started a month after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed trade embargoes in 1986 Since then an argument has raged in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about whether such sanctions hurt the black majority by weakening the economy or help them by forcing reforms. `` The purpose of that act was to ensure that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader -RRB- <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was freed, that political organizations were unbanned and that free political dialogue happened in the country, among others,'' said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, who refused to give his personal view on the issue. `` Mandela has not been released, and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is still banned and on top of that several other organizations have been banned. If you look at it in those terms, it's easy to say sanctions have not been effective,'' he said. However, he said Americans who push for sanctions `` look upon them as a tool which will remind the people in political power that -LRB- they have -RRB- to make some changes before they are looked upon as responsible members of the Western world of nations.'' He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is changing `` to a different kind of country, to one where the majority population will have a decisive say in how they are governed.'' `` I am encouraged,'' he said, `` but I would say, as an outside observer, the road is still a pretty long one to travel.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called on Arabs and Israelis today to show a more conciliatory attitude towards each other's interests as a means of beginning a `` serious negotiating process.'' `` Let the Arab world take concrete steps toward accommodation with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ not in place of the peace process, but as a catalyst for it,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group that lobbies for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> issued an appeal to conservative elements in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, calling on them to `` lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that Israeli interests in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> can be accommodated in a settlement based on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions spelling out framework for a peace settlement.

He asked Israelis to `` reach out to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as neighbors who deserve political rights.'' In a similar vein, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to `` reach out to Israelis and convince them of your peaceful intentions. `` You have the most to gain from doing so, and no one else can or will do it for you,'' he said. `` And no one is going to ` deliver' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for you.''

 In most statehouses, if a legislator's vote was cast while he was away or a bill was mysteriously transferred from one committee to another it would be discussed heatedly for months It's all in a day's work in the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 41-9, was torn apart in a power struggle at the beginning of the year, there have been sharp conflicts between Majority Leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>. Fourteen of <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s 16 top bills were killed by committees controlled by the <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> side, and <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s supporters have defeated a few of the opposition's bills on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The Republicans helped <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>'s group strip <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> of most of his traditional power in a series of 26-24 votes at the beginning of the year. Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> won the right to unilaterally summon bills out of committee and onto the floor for votes. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators have emerged as power brokers and peacemakers, siding with <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> to defeat some questionable bills sponsored by the <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> group. Similar upheavals occurred this year in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where bipartisan coalitions ousted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speakers. An attempt in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> failed when the Democratic speaker formed an alliance of his own with Republicans. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, the parties agreed to elect co-speakers who would alternate control of the chamber. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with no clear-cut winner, the feuding has continued intermittently. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> normally adjourns in late May or early June, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is several weeks behind last year's pace and the big test of the year _ budget negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Republican Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> _ has not yet started. <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> met May 16 to try to hammer out a unified <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> position, their first face-to-face meeting in months aside from brief encounters on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. They said later that agreement would take some time but would not be impossible, in part because the state's tight financial picture means little money will be left over for lawmakers' pet projects. The meeting followed a tense week marked by what <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> labeled two `` absolutely incredible'' incidents. The first was when state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Ambra </PERSON>, a Democrat who supports <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>, was recorded as voting with the <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> faction on a hotly contested bill while he was in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the day. <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said someone must have accidentally pressed <PERSON> D'Ambra </PERSON>'s voting button <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> D'Ambra </PERSON> said that was impossible. A day later, the <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> faction noticed that a bill assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> has a majority, had somehow been transferred to <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, presiding over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, ruled the bill was improperly reported out and he was upheld on a 24-24 vote. The Republicans helped <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> on that vote. They also have helped defeat bills sponsored by the <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> group that would have allowed deer hunters to trespass on private property and short-circuited the normal chartering procedure for a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> man who wants to open a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> bank. <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> has begun looking ahead, to the 1990 elections. In a recent interview, he said the <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> group's successful fight to defeat a Carlin-backed bill banning assault weapons would be used against <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>'s supporters in the election. `` It's a motherhood and apple pie issue, and they voted against motherhood and apple pie,'' <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> said. But the feud is not universal. <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, has helped several <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> supporters, such as state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donelan </PERSON>, to publicize their bills. `` That person, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, is here for all the senators,'' said <PERSON> Donelan </PERSON>. `` She has done a good job for me ... I think a lot of the staff has tried to remain neutral.''

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> failed Monday in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> attempt to kill a lawsuit by two former members who say they were `` brainwashed'' into joining the church. Church officials had said the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom should nullify the lawsuit. But the justices dismissed the appeal without comment, refusing to shield the church from the suit seeking damages. In other action, the court: _ Rejected an appeal by mass murderer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> man convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33 boys and young men No one in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history has been convicted of killing more people. _ Ruled unanimously that a lawsuit against the owners of the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>, target of a terrorist hijacking in 1985, may be tried in a federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rather than in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> _ Agreed to use a case from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to study a federal regulation aimed at saving the government time and money when it mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients _ Let stand a ruling that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> may be sued for monetary damages in state court by people contending officials allowed excessive noise and air pollution at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> _ Rejected an appeal by former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties The court refused to use the case to set guidelines on when some people may challenge their fraud convictions after completing prison terms for those convictions. _ Limited, by a 6-3 vote, federal judges' power to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials The court allowed a jury to be told about the criminal record of a young <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> man who sued over the loss of his arm in a car wash accident. In the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> case, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> said in lawsuits that they were duped into becoming `` Moonies'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> saud he was a 27-year-old law school graduate in 1979 when recruited by church members in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said two men approached him at a bus stop and told him they belonged to an international community of socially conscious people. He went to dinner with them and thereafter to a retreat outside the city where he and others were kept to a tight schedule of lectures, group discussions and calisthenics, he said. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> said the group members repeatedly denied their organization was a religious one. Only on the 12th day was he told the group belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> said he was confused and angry but stayed on when members persuaded him that deception had been necessary because of the church's negative reputation. Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> told a similar story in court papers. She said she was a 19-year-old college student when a recruiter approached her at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bus station in 1979. She said she was not told the group was part of the <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> until her 22nd day at the retreat. Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> remained church members for several months before they were abducted by `` deprogrammers'' who had been hired by their parents. They are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotional distress they say they suffered. <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> also is seeking the return of $ 6,000 he donated to the church. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, voting 6-1 last October, overruled two lower courts and reinstated the suits. It ordered jury trials. The state court said the <PERSON> Molko </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> are entitled to trials to present evidence they were `` brainwashed'' and `` the church's agents rendered them incapable of deciding not to join.'' The state court rejected arguments that forcing the church to defend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its right to practice religion freely. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, other religious organizations and a group consisting primarily of college professors had urged the justices to overrule the state court. The groups had said the state court ruling `` has had, and will continue to have, a serious chilling effect on religious proselytizing and conversion in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere.''

 Radical students burned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags and clashed with riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> on Monday as they began a week of protests to demand the expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Students organized demonstrations on at least 23 campuses nationwide. Most were peaceful and small in scale, with just a few hundred students taking part, police reports said. But in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, about 170 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, an estimated 1,000 students hurled rocks and sticks at riot police in a violent demonstration, officials said. Students demanded that 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty be withdrawn immediately. They burned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and put up posters denouncing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, police arrested 18 students armed with iron bars and firebombs who briefly occupied an office at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. Students smashed windows and threw anti-government and anti-American leaflets outside, they said. `` Disband the torture and murder machine,'' students chanted before being overpowered by police. Security was stepped up at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and military facilities, with riot police standing guard. Nine busloads of riot police guarded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Past Glorious, Future Uncertain For Cape Hatteras Lighthouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION> has symbolized the rugged beauty of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Outer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banks </LOCATION> islands for generations, and now the tower that warned ships of dangerous shoals is itself threatened by the sea. For years, debate has raged about what should be done to preserve the nation's oldest and tallest brick lighthouse. When it was built in 1870 _ replacing one that had fallen into the sea _ the 208-foot lighthouse was 1,500 feet from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The shoreline has advanced about 11 feet per year since then and waves now crash less than 200 feet from its base. The future of the landmark was left uncertain again last week when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said it was putting off a decision on how to preserve the tower. Instead, the park service said it plans to issue a special document listing options for protecting the lighthouse in about three weeks. Then the agency will accept public comment for 30 to 90 days before making a final decision. `` We're trying to determine whether the comment cries out for hearings or meetings,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a park service spokesman. Over the years, a number of efforts _ including steel groins and artificial seaweed to hold sand _ have done little to slow the sea's natural advance. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> was set to build a 23-foot-high revetment and seawall around the spire at a cost of $ 5.6 million. But a group calling itself the Move the <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> persuaded the park service to reconsider, saying the ocean would eventually surround the lighthouse, making it an island. Last year, a panel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> recommended the 2,600-ton lighthouse be moved inland. The panel of 10 experts estimated that moving the lighthouse 500 feet on rails would cost $ 4.6 million and take a year. `` If you want to save the lighthouse there is absolutely no alternative,'' said <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilkey </PERSON>, a professor of geology at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Move the <ORGANIZATION> Lighthouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But many residents of <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> fear the monument will collapse if it is moved. Instead, they favor efforts to replenish the beaches, using sand fences and more artificial seaweed or groins. The <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> committee acknowledged some detrimental effects of relocating the lighthouse. As many as eight acres of ancient maritime forest in adjacent <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> could be lost in clearing a new site, they said. `` If they move it we're going to lose something whether it falls or not because it wo n't be on the same site it was built on,'' said <PERSON> Rany </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennette </PERSON>, whose father was the last civilian keeper of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Light </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennette </PERSON>, who was born in the adjacent lighthouse keeper's quarters in 1921, comes up from his home in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, every summer to work as a seasonal ranger and tour guide `` I would go up to the top any time my father would let me,'' he said. `` One thing I really enjoyed was using the old heavy spyglasses to watch the ships go by.''

 Red velvet ropes on Monday blocked the entrances to <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON>'s Atlantis Casino Hotel, the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> casino closed by gaming regulators for financial reasons. The state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered the Atlantis to close its multilevel casino floors after it ran up debts of $ 150 million. Regulators are considering a bid by developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy the Atlantis for $ 63 million and convert it into a luxury non-casino hotel. Shortly before the normal start of gambling at 10 a.m., a small group of customers waited at the bottom of the stalled escalators. A security guard arrived and told them the casino was closed for good. `` There are apparently some people who do n't read newspapers or watch television,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Budniak </PERSON>, the Atlantis security shift supervisor. `` But these are a bunch of people who were attached to this place. It's sad.'' `` We'll have to go look for another place to gamble,'' said <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I feel so bad. I feel like crying.'' Two other customers said they gambled until the bitter end at 4 a.m., when casino attendants stopped handing out change for the slot machines, the last roulette wheel stopped spinning and dealers laid their last cards on the green felt. `` We came to say good-bye,'' said <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> <PERSON> Miozzi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We love this place. We've been coming here for all eight years it's been open.'' About 600 hotel and restaurant workers remain on the payroll out of 2,000 employees. Casino workers were required to turn in their gaming licenses, but were told officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would visit the Atlantis on Tuesday to offer them part-time positions as dealers or cashiers. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns two other casinos and is building a third, the legal limit for an individual owner.

 A Soviet air force pilot who was wounded while fleeing his country has been moved to an <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> hospital from <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where he landed his MiG-29 fighter, state radio reported Monday. The radio did not identify the hospital and officials would not reveal the pilot's whereabouts. Officials said they doubted the government would grant the Soviet request for extradition. Newspapers said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts had examined the MiG-29, the most modern jet in the Soviet air force. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> landed Saturday in <LOCATION> Trabzon </LOCATION>, with a bleeding arm wound, and asked for asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Monday a doctor in charge at the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hospital, said: `` Police came, took him away and we do n't know where.'' `` The pilot is under the protection of Turkish officials responsible for his safety,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belger </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> allowed the plane to be flown back to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Sunday. It was stripped of rockets and weapons, which were returned on a separate plane. Newspapers reported Monday the MiG-29 was examined by <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts. Turkish officials and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused comment. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shonia </PERSON> of the Soviet Embassy told reporters <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> was a terrorist and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s refusal to extradite him would amount to support for terrorism. A Turkish official said privately, however: `` The Russians know that in many decades we have not sent back home any military person, from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> or </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, who asked for asylum.'' In 1983, a Soviet general in uniform walked across the border to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and was flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His name was not revealed in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> but newspaper reports claimed he was a high-level security officer. Three jets have been flown from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since 1970 and the government returned only those Soviets who wanted to go home. Pravda, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reported Monday that <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> was working as a duty dispatcher at the Tskhakaya airfield north of <LOCATION> Batumi </LOCATION> and therefore was armed on the day of his flight. It said he shot and wounded a sentry, who fired back and wounded <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON>. Two other Soviet fighters started chasing the MiG-29 but could not intercept <PERSON> Zuyev </PERSON> because the border was so near, Pravda said.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell Monday in reaction to political developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as concern continued in the British colony over its future when it reverts to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in eight years. Brokers say the activity had been expected because of the tense situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over student demonstrations for democratic reforms and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's declaration of martial law Saturday to end the protests. Stock exchange executives urged investors to stay calm, but brokers expect developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to continue to govern the market's activities. Some said it might take a week for the market to stabilize. The Hang Seng Index of blue chips plunged 339.06 points to close at 2,806.57 with all key shares suffering losses. The index lost 288.27 points in 15 minutes when the market opened but recovered slightly to end the session at 2,887.89. On Friday, the last day of trading before the weekend holiday, the index fell 132.03 points in panic selling in the worst single-day plunge since the worldwide market collapse in October 1987. Turnover totaled $ 384.4 million Monday, compared with $ 316 million on Friday. There are fears the failure of the student movement could affect <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future and how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will govern the territory in 1997 when it comes under Chinese sovereignty. Under a Sino-British agreement signed in 1984, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will become a Special Administrative Region of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under a `` one country, two systems'' formula. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised to preserve <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s freewheeling social and economic system that has made it an international financial center for 50 years beyond 1997 and allow <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people to govern the territory. But many of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 5.7 million residents remain skeptical of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> promises and the viability of the concept that would allow a capitalistic enclave to exist under communism. An estimated two-thirds of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s population are refugees from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or their descendants who fled the Chinese mainland. On Sunday, a crowd of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese estimated at between 400,000 and 1 million rallied in support of the pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in what was described as the largest protest march in the British colony's history. The marchers, who included staffers from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and other leftist organizations, demanded the resignation of Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, not noted for its political activism, has found a rallying point which has stirred its collective consciousness to an extent that has surprised everyone,'' said an editorial in the English-language South China Morning Post.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused Monday to allow enforcement of a new state law requiring minors to get parental or judicial consent for abortions, but moved up a hearing on the law's validity. The decison means that single women under 18 throughout <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will be able to get abortions without consent of parents or judges, at least until the high court rules following oral arguments June 27, a lawyer for the state said. The justices last week had decided to hear a case involving a 15-year-old girl in September, but agreed Monday to expedite the case at the request of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>'s office The state repeated a request to allow enforcement of the law until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules on its validity, but the justices denied that motion for a second time. `` With the denial of the stay, it is our opinion that the law is unenforceable statewide,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>. The state's <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, ruling in the case involving the 15-year-old, struck down the abortion consent law as unconstitutional. The case last week went from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> high court, which denied a stay of the 5th District ruling sought by a lawyer representing the rights of the girl's fetus, to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which also declined without comment to order enforcement of the law. Lawyers had disagreed whether the ruling by the 5th District in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> would apply to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s other four appeal court districts as well, but <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision erased all doubt. He said that under the decision, the 15-year-old girl can legally go ahead with her abortion, if she has not already done so. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, has repeatedly refused to comment on whether the girl has had or plans to have the abortion, citing her client's right to privacy. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> did not return telephone calls Monday. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, an abortion opponent, said he was disappointed by the justices' decision. `` I would rather have -LRB- the law -RRB- implemented and carried out as I have supported it in the past,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. The girl is identifed in court records only as `` T.W., A Minor.'' The justices ordered the case file sealed to ensure that her identity remain a secret. The case began when T.W. sought consent from a judge to have an abortion, telling him she feared physical and emotional abuse from her parents if she sought permission from them. The judge said he was unable to deal with the law as written, and the consent requirement subsequently was found unconstitutionally vague by the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, under fire for allegedly using his position for personal gain, climbed out of debt last year, according to a financial disclosure statement released today. The forms showed that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat paid off debts of between $ 105,000 and $ 200,000 and now has no liabilities, but his assets also declined. He listed 1988 assets of $ 31,005 to $ 100,000 _ compared with between $ 155,000 and $ 435,000 the year before. Those figures do not fully reflect holdings placed in a blind trust established by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1987. House members and senators must annually report their outside income, including speaking fees _ known as honoraria _ gifts, assets and liabilities.

 While students at century-old <ORGANIZATION> Slippery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> treasure their school's funny name, university officials say it can be a mixed blessing. Some students and faculty came to this state university, which celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, because the quirky name attracted their attention. `` It's a bizarre name,'' said <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancia </PERSON>, a freshman from <LOCATION> Acton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who said the name caught her eye on a computer printout of schools with strong education programs. `` But if it was n't called this, I would n't be here.'' Slippery Rock does n't always conjure up images of lofty scholarship, however. `` We're kind of like the advertising jingle where nine out of 10 people recognize the trade name but they ca n't tie it to the product,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouse </PERSON>, provost and vice president for academic affairs. The university is battling an image as a party school after a recent <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> labeled it that way. Sure, there are parties at <LOCATION> Slippery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but they're no more frequent than at other universities, a student said. `` It's just because of the name,'' said <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, 21, a senior from <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>. The town's creek was named Slippery Rock after a colonial soldier plunged into it when his horse slipped on a rock in 1779. Later, when the existence of two neighboring towns called <LOCATION> Centerville </LOCATION> caused a mix-up in postal deliveries, one was renamed Slippery Rock. The town has a population of 2,000 today. The name later was passed on to the school. The name is what drew actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> to take a detour off Interstate 79 last month to buy a few Slippery Rock T-shirts. Slippery Rock does a brisk business in T-shirts, according to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, manager of the university's book store. `` I do n't understand it,'' <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said. `` It's a common -LRB- name -RRB- to us. But it's a fascination, a loyal following out there. ... There is n't a state in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where we have n't shipped these things.

She said <PERSON> Meghann </PERSON> played with her gifts for most of the day Sunday. <PERSON> Meghann </PERSON> was born with biliary atresia, a a fatal liver defect, and complications necessitated the series of transplants in November and December 1986.

<HEAD>Farmers' Income Prospects Brightening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Higher-than-expected prices for crops and livestock have boosted farmers' cash income prospects for 1989 by at least $ 2 billion from the forecast of just a month ago, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist said Monday. In revising the earlier prediction, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said figures for the fourth quarter of 1988 showed that cash receipts for sales of major commodities produced on the nation's farms `` were stronger than forecast'' initially and that the momentum continued into the first quarter of 1989. `` Our crop receipts are projected to set an all-time record in 1989,'' <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There has been price strength in both crops and livestock.'' The latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock at around $ 81 billion, with sales of crops at $ 76 billion. But expenses are rising, too, as farmers put more cropland back into production, and direct federal payments to farmers decline. Nationally, including all farm-related cash receipts, the gross cash income of farmers could be in the range of $ 168 billion to $ 173 billion, compared with about $ 170 billion in 1988. Expenses are forecast at $ 115 billion to $ 119 billion, compared with $ 113 billion last year. As a result, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said, farmers this year could see net cash income in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion. That would be down from the 1988 record of $ 57.7 billion. Just a month ago, the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at $ 48 billion to $ 52 billion. Net cash income is the annual difference between gross cash income and cash operating expenses. As defined by the agency, it is the amount of money farmers have available to pay debts, make purchases and pay for family living expenses. As used by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, net cash income during a calendar year can include proceeds from sales of crops produced in earlier years. For example, one reason that 1988 net cash income reached a high level _ besides rising commodity prices _ was that many farmers raised cash by selling off grain held from past harvests. In addition, many livestock producers culled herds because they lacked the feed and needed the money. In another method of bookkeeping, the agency computes net farm income, which is a calendar year measure of the net value of agricultural production, whether sold or stored on the farm. Under this method, changes in inventory values are taken into consideration, along with values assigned to `` non-money'' income such as an allowance for a farm family's dwelling and other factors. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s latest projections for 1989, net farm income could rebound to record level of $ 47 billion to $ 52 billion. Last year, when inventories were drawn down sharply, net farm income was about $ 41 billion, down from $ 46.3 billion in 1987. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s comments followed an outlook report Friday in which analysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are `` not much changed'' from earlier forecasts, except that the weather has shifted the distributions. `` Wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with large carry-in stocks -LRB- inventories -RRB- will have higher incomes because prices are up,'' the report said. `` But wheat producers who were hit by the dry weather this winter and spring, and who lack stocks or crop insurance, will sustain losses.''

 Iranian drug addicts who do n't kick the habit by July 23 will be rounded up and thrown into labor camps for at least one year, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> TV reported Monday. The broadcast quoted the governor general of southeastern <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> province as telling a news conference that special segregated camps for men and women have been built to rehabilitate addicts. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> als reported that 15 convicted drug traffickers were hanged Monday. That raised the number of smugglers executed in the last 10 days to 94. Iranian authorities have executed more than 650 drug smugglers and traffickers since a crackdown was launched in December. State-run TV did not identify the <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> official, but he was quoted as saying rehabilated addicts will be quarantined with their families until they could be allowed back into society. He said reformed addicts would undergo regular medical examinations to ensure they were drug-free, said the TV report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Anyone who turned to drugs again would be returned to the camps, the official said. The law mandates the death penalty for anyone possessing even small quantities of drugs. More than 2,500 addicts have been reported picked up since January. Unofficial reports estimate that 2 million of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people are involved in drug abuse.

<TEXT>
 The world produces more food than it needs but neglect, complacency and incompetence have left at least half a billion people hungry, participants in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference on hunger were told Monday. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that deals with the political aspects of food supplies, opened its 15th annual conference with conflicting but generally grim assessments on the state of hunger in the world. Council Chairman <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesqueira </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said `` peace is a basic prerequisite'' to ending worldwide starvation. `` Wars in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> make their scarce resources go to arms rather than food programs. Detente is important for developed and developing countries,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, in a statement read at the opening of the conference, said hunger still can be eliminated. `` Five years ago, the council noted that hunger ... was largely a man-made phenomenon: human error or neglect created it, human complacency perpetuated it and human resolve could eradicate it,'' the statement said. `` That is equally true today.'' <PERSON> Pesqueira </PERSON> said comprehensive figures on world hunger are difficult to determine. The conference heard widely divergent figures. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, cited statistics that said 512 million people in the world suffer from hunger, and that the figure is increasing annually by 10 million people. But <PERSON> Ide </PERSON> <PERSON> Oumarou </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that 800 million people are either temporarily or permanently hungry. He said the world produces 10 percent more food than it needs, meaning the cause of hunger is `` a question of distribution and imbalances created by international trade, not of shortage.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reports, most malnourished people live in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Among seriously troubled countries, it cited <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Young children, pregnant and nursing women and the elderly are the most vulnerable to hunger, the council says. It says malnutrition coupled with diarrhea and infectious diseases kill an estimated 14 million children under age five every year, and 83 percent of the malnourished people under five live in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and about 12 percent in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> urges help for poor countries to start projects to become self-sufficient in food rather than depending totally on deliveries of surplus food from richer countries. The 36-member council is to meet for four days, during which delegates will tour projects north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> where large sections of desert are being reclaimed for agriculture.

 A top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official with links to two controversial criminal investigators has been cleared of bribery charges and released from custody, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON>, former second-ranking party official in the Moldavian republic, was charged Jan. 11 with taking bribes. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said at the time that <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> had been popular in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> where he was sent in 1984 because of his activity in an investigation that broke up a chain of corruption in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. That investigation was led by <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, two investigators who tracked a chain of bribery and corruption that led to <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, the son-in-law of former leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` Today, the case against <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> was dropped due to the absence of facts of the crime, and he was released from custody,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said prosecutors `` apologized to <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> for the serious violations of socialist legality with regard to him on the part of officials from the prosecutor's office.'' It did not identify the officials responsible for arresting him. Gdlyan and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> gained wide popularity in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of their investigation, and both won seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament that meets for the first time Thursday. But <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> has been sharply attacked by the Kremlin for saying in a televised election debate May 12 that the name of Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has come up in his corruption investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ordered an investigation of Gdlyan because of the jailing of a famous Estonian scientist who died in prison and later was cleared of charges. A commission of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, on Friday reported systematic violations of laws and ethics by <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, and turned their findings over to the Soviet Procurator General's Office. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and demanded that results of an investigation be made public. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a statement of his about the corruption investigation was read at Monday's meeting of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It did not provide details. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News on Jan. 22 said <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> was one of four delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in June 1988 that <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, identified in a speech as having been implicated in taking bribes. If true, that would mean that <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> was implicated by <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, who wrote the article published by <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>'s magazine alleging four unidentified delegates to the conference had taken bribes. But <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> itself later published the names of four Uzbek officials that it said had been fired from party jobs or were being prosecuted as a result of an investigation started after <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>'s speech at the party conference <PERSON> Smirnov </PERSON> resigned his job in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said fuller information about his case would be published later.

The dump, if <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> is deemed a suitable site, would open in 2003. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> pledged that <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> would be given a full opportunity to do its own studies of the site, about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also promised `` some additional funding'' for the state studies, although exact amounts were not discussed, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' office had no comment on the meeting. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had given his `` personal assurance that <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> was not a done deal,'' and that the department would make a full and objective study of the site before deciding whether it would be suitable for holding the waste. The dump is intended to entomb 70,000 tons of highly radioactive waste from commercial reactors and from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons plants Numerous sites had been under consideration early in the decade, but in 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decreed that the search would be limited to <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> earlier this month said that while he was legally obligated to pursuing the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> program, he sympathized with the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> government's misgivings. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he and the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> congressonal delegation were sending a letter to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expressing support for a bill that would make it illegal to build a permanent nuclear waste dump in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The bill passed the state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year and has not yet been acted on by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ordered the British to reduce their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> employees by nearly half Monday in the latest expulsion exchange. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s actions showed that little had changed despite <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the total number of employees permitted at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and companies would be reduced from 375 to 205, the number of Soviets permitted to work in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Soviet embassies abroad do not have non-Soviet employees. The latest diplomatic flap began Friday when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists out of the country on grounds they were engaged in activities incompatible with their status, a diplomatic phrase for spying. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> called the accusation `` groundless'' and retaliated by ordering the same number of British diplomats and journalists to leave. It is the largest British-Soviet expulsion exchange in four years. In 1985, a total of 31 diplomats, journalists and other representatives were sent home and, in 1971, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled 105 Soviets. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said he did not know whether the reduction of 170 people could be accomplished by dismissing Soviet employees or whether some accredited diplomats, journalists and businessmen would have to be sent home. An embassy spokesman said about 150 accredited Britons work in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including 68 diplomats. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> Monday: `` We gave them the chance and they have not taken it, and they have revealed their true nature.'' `` We had hoped that, with a new era dawning in relations, that with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> taking a different view on many things, that they might have accepted -LRB- the expulsions -RRB- and not retaliated the way they did. `` Were they going to show that things were different, or were they going to prove by what they did that things really have not changed much at all? They chose the latter.'' Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the foreign secretary, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would continue working for improved relations, but `` we shall not turn a blind eye to unacceptable activity which threatens our national security and so the safety of our citizens.'' `` It is because of the continuance of this kind of conduct that it is necessary for us to remain vigilant in all respects toward the conduct of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In October 1986, a similar action during an espionage dispute stripped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of 260 Soviet employees. American diplomats had to shovel snow, do their own cooking and otherwise fend for themselves until the support employees could be replaced by Westerners. The British spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know how many Soviet citizens the embassy employed. He said they handle such non-diplomatic jobs as driving and translating. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> made his announcement at a news conference, where British correspondents challenged accusations that three of their number were spies. He set the tone of the meeting by saying: `` The Soviet side has certain information that some <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> employees in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fulfill the orders of secret services.'' <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, correspondent of the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> whether he dared repeat the accusation directly to the three correspondents. `` Are you prepared to accuse our colleagues of spying, here in front of all their peers?'' he demanded. The ministry spokesman said only that the expulsion order was prepared without his knowledge. In response to another question, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said he agreed the cutback could affect attempts to attract Western investment if it includes employees of British-Soviet joint ventures. `` I will redirect that question to the people who have drawn up this text,'' he said. British companies have formed at least 19 joint ventures with Soviet enterprises, offering badly needed foreign currency, management expertise and technology. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> did not say how long the reductions would take, who would be affected or whether the cuts would be achieved through attrition, expulsions or withdrawals of employees by government order. The British spokesman said the embassy would have no comment until those matters were clarified. The disagreement comes at a time of improved relations. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have a good personal relationship and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received a warm greeting when he visited <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> early this month.

<HEAD>S&amp;Ls' Securities Regulations Tightened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators on Monday announced new regulations requiring savings institutions to meet more stringent standards in documenting their securities activities, the latest in a series of steps to tighten supervision of the troubled industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issued amended regulations requiring S & amp; Ls to report their securities transactions according to generally accepted accounting principles and to clearly distinguish between those securities held for sale, for trading and as investments. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls would be able to conduct the same securities transactions as in the past, `` but they've got to account for -LRB- them -RRB- in a more realistic sense.'' `` They've been lumping them all together, which makes it very hard for auditors or for our own exam staff to get a handle on the exact financial picture,'' <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> said. `` This is just one more step of a series that we've taken to tighten up the supervision of savings institutions.'' A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposal to restructure the industry and rescue depositors with money in insolvent S & amp; Ls is working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of regulatory affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said the bank board's new rules `` establish a much more stringent standard'' as to when S & amp; Ls can value securities at their higher, historical costs versus market value, which could be lower. S & amp; Ls would have to hold securities `` through thick or thin'' to maturity in order to value them for accounting purposes at the higher level, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The bank board's action requires an S & amp; L's board of directors to adopt an investment policy on securities and to monitor the institution's compliance with that strategy. Management, meanwhile, will be responsible for carrying out securities transactions that comply with the investment policies. <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> said the rules would help federal regulators assess the financial status of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LS and help thrift managers `` have a better handle on their own situation.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the new rules could reduce S & amp; Ls' flexibility in deciding whether to sell off or hold on to securities. If securities were classified as a long-term investment, institutions would n't be able to switch course and `` just get rid of it if they do n't like it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawyers Push for Pardon for Woman Who Made New Life After Escape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH GROAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A convicted robber who escaped and created a new life for herself during 10 years of freedom should be granted a pardon because of her extraordinary success rehabilitating herself, her attorney contends. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will hear the case for pardoning <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, on Tuesday. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was recaptured because of a tip from her ex-husband, would be the first inmate to be pardoned since at least the 1940s for any reason other than terminal illness. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, pardons can be granted only by a special board, and before it will consider a hearing, five of the seven members must vote to approve an investigation. `` It is very rare that inmates request pardon hearings,'' board spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. In 1975, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, then known as <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on five counts of armed robbery and sentenced to 12 years in prison. She walked away from a work release program in 1978 and hitchhiked to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. During the next decade, she earned her high school diploma, overcame drug and alcohol abuse, married <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, raised a foster child and two sons, and became a successful real estate agent. `` Her story is the most extraordinary story any of us has ever heard about someone who has ever rehabilitated herself,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpootlian </PERSON>, her attorney in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` Someone who was convicted of several armed robberies and a drug problem, on the run took herself and pulled herself up by her bootstraps to become a productive member of society.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s happy life ended in May 1988 when her previous husband, convicted of murder in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, tipped authorities to her whereabouts. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to finish her original prison sentence and one additional year for escape. Under an interstate agreement, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was transferred last fall to the Women's Correctional Institution in <LOCATION> Jessup </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, so she could be closer to home. `` There's no reason for her being in there other than just punishment,'' her husband said in a telephone interview from his home in Severn, Md. `` She's made changes in her life, and it has n't cost anyone anything except her. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, said he and the couple's two teen-age sons from Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s previous marriage would be at the hearing in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was unlikely to be allowed to attend because the board did not request her presence, said her attorney in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON>. Despite the lack of precedent, <PERSON> Hassett </PERSON> said he was optimistic. `` I spoke to her on Friday, and she and her family are also extremely optimistic,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpootlian </PERSON> and I both believe we've put her case in the best possible posture for consideration.'' Should the pardon request be refused, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in April.

 Hundreds of workers cheered opposition leaders who defied a government ban on demonstrations and appeared Monday at factories to seek support for their claim to the presidency. The opposition's three top candidates, seeking recognition of their victory in the May 7 general election, shook hands and passed out leaflets welcoming a delegation from the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> due Tuesday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> will not solve all our problems, but it will create the environment. They have come to investigate,'' said presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. Workers greeted him at factories in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with chants of `` Endara is my president!'' and `` Justice! Justice!'' International observers say the opposition won the elections by a 3-1 margin. The government and its de facto ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, nullified the vote after it was apparent their candidates were losing. Monday was the third straight day that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice presidential candidates, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, defied the ban on demonstrations that will last until the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation files its report June 5. The delegation is made up of the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. A pro-government party Monday criticized the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> for adopting a resolution condemning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and said its delegation could not mediate among Panamanians. `` We call on the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to adopt a virile attitude toward aggression against our people by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest pro-government group. After touring factories Monday, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said, `` We want a transfer of power from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to a civilian government.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> holds power because he commands the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. He has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but says the charges are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, due to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sent to augment security at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> canal installations continued exercises Monday, including special jungle training and live firing. On Monday the opposition candidates, pursued by a caravan of journalists, left party headquarters without revealing their exact destination. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the opposition is not calling for large, announced demonstrations in order to avoid `` butchery.'' `` We're going to visit all 2 million of our supporters, one by one,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said after sharing a cup of coffee with a few workers. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has a population of about 2.5 million. On May 10, paramilitary <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters attacked opposition candidates, leaving a bodyguard dead and <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> bloodied. Crowds were small but enthusiastic Monday. At a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Beer brewery, workers came running from the far ends of the plant. At one stop the candidates put on work gloves and gathered around a grinding machine that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, an enthusiastic campaigner, adjusted without being entirely certain of the results. By the end of the trip to a dozen factories, including such U.S.-associated plants as Coca-Cola, General <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s collar was covered with lipstick. Only a few police officers were visible as the caravan wound through a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> industrial park. Most officers were directing traffic. Since the May 10 attack the government has sharply reduced police presence, emboldening opponents despite a general strike that fizzled last week. At a Kraft cheese plant, one worker snatched a leaflet from another and said, `` That's not for toads to read.'' Members of the government's extensive network of informers are called `` toads.'' The man who had been called a toad retreated.

 Question: What's 3 -LCB- feet long, weighs 35 pounds and lives on 5 pounds of smelt a day, plus nearly $ 5,000 worth of assorted exotic saltwater fish? Answer: The grouper that ate <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s pet store aquarium. `` Day after day he got progressively larger and our inventory of fish got progressively lower,'' said <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s Aquarium & amp; Pet Center The spotted jewfish, a type of grouper, was purchased for $ 150 and arrived at a petite one foot long and 3 pounds just 18 months ago. It was caught off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> put it in the store's 1,100-gallon saltwater show tank, which once contained about 75 fish. Groupers are known to prey on smaller fish, but <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> thought he could control what it ate by hand feeding it. That did n't work. `` He's eaten everything in the aquarium,'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said Monday from his store in this southern <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` That's about $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 worth of fish.'' It's also the last straw for <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, who said he plans to ship the fish back to its native environment, where it can swim for its own supper. The fish is fed 5 pounds of smelt a day, but the list of its a la carte snacks from among its tank-mates is impressive. In the last six months, the grouper ate a clown trigger fish worth $ 600, two imperator angels worth about $ 250 each, two queen angels worth $ 150 each, one blue racer worth $ 50, and 50 yellow tangs worth $ 20 each. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said he gave little thought to placing the expensive clown trigger in the tank because groupers have not been known to include them in their diet. But it did n't stop the grouper, which experts say can grow to as much as 8 feet. `` It's in there for a day and turns into food,'' he said. Thinking a swift fish would be safe from the lumbering grouper's jaws, <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> placed a 12-inch blue racer in the tank `` The racer was in there about a month,'' he said. `` The grouper just lay there and waited. It raced too slow one day and he was gone.'' In fact, the grouper has devoured everything except a couple of 6-foot moray eels and a nurse shark. But not for lack of trying. `` We came in one morning and it had the shark in its mouth about halfway down,'' he said. `` We beat him with a broom handle and he spit him out.'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> bought the fish from <ORGANIZATION> Noyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, an aquarium supplier in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> and plans to return it to the sea off that city on July 5. The fish will be flown to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and released by divers, he said, adding that he does n't know yet how much that will cost. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> offered the grouper to zoos and the Shedd Aquarium in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but they said there was no room. The owners of a nearby restaurant had another idea. `` They'd put their hands up to the tank and measure him and smile,'' he said. `` They were really eying him up, but I ca n't imagine anybody having our fish for dinner.

 God's Little one-sixty-ninth of an Acre is now available to sun-loving city-slickers for $ 38,682. The catch: it's a slab of rooftop `` The idea developed out of my own observation of the marketplace and the general high demand for outside space that most apartment buyers prefer,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Jacob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a development company. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> decided to divide the roof of a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> building into 14 patio spaces and sell them to people who first buy a one-to four-room apartment in the building for $ 130,000 to $ 212,000. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, unlike most cities, has few park spaces or open areas. And apartments are smaller, which makes New Yorkers desire a little more freedom,'' he said Monday. Escape to this roof to view the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the west, <LOCATION> midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to the north and <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> to the south. This building is a story or two taller than its neighbors and zoning restrictions have kept skyscrapers at bay. On the roof, $ 12,894 plus a monthly maintenance of $ 42.84 gets you 235 square feet of tar beach with lights and running water, enclosed by a 6-foot-high fence. Big spenders can pay $ 38,682 for 625 square feet, or just over 1-69th of an acre, with a maintenance charge of $ 128.52 _ 60 percent tax deductible. A 10-foot-wide common area will be decorated with plants. `` We wanted to give it a feeling of graciousness, so that people were n't being corralled,'' said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. Security will be provided so that no one steals lawn chairs or exercise bicycles. `` One guy may have dinner there, another may have a garden and one may fly a kite,'' said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. `` On the issue of barbecuing, we'd rather not discuss it. Technically, it's primarily for sunbathing.'' The management company has just started advertising the apartments. The 300 people who called last weekend were told about the added incentive of a rooftop co-op, and some of them seemed interested, said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. In a city where parking spaces and yacht slips already are sold for hefty prices, is there any limit to the type of property that can turn co-op? `` I'm a real estate man _ that's a broad question,'' said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, who once dreamed that co-op car ownership would be `` the way to go.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip, supplemented his salary by giving speeches and collecting rent on property in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, his financial disclosure forms showed Monday. The lawmaker's income ranged from $ 123,525 to $ 136,025 in 1988. His base salary was $ 89,500, boosted by rents of $ 5,000 to $ 15,000, honoraria after charitable donations of $ 26,525 and interest from a federal credit union of $ 2,500 to $ 5,000. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, whose personal finances have recently drawn public attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986 financial disclosure form, put most of his assets in a qualified blind trust in June 1988. At the time, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat's holdings were worth $ 65,000 to $ 150,000, with the largest investment _ a rental duplex in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, _ valued at $ 50,000 to $ 150,000. The assets that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> kept out of the blind trust include another rental property in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, valued at $ 50,000 to $ 100,000, and savings accounts, money market accounts and individual retirements accounts worth $ 25,000 to $ 80,000. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> listed no purchases or sale of property, stocks or bonds in 1988, but he did refinance his principal residence in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs. That arrangement allowed him in October to pay off loans of $ 80,000 to $ 200,000, the forms show. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> satisfied a commercial loan of $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 line of credit from <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the same line of credit from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also sent his trustee, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehler </PERSON>, a check for $ 60,000 for inclusion in his blind trust last November, according to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure. He did not say where the money came from; his aides said they would ask. Excluding his blind trust, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was left with one liability, a 50,000 to $ 100,000 mortgage on his Merced rental house from the Tracy Savings and Loan institution. Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, lawmakers are not required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their principal residence. Another exemption is details of a spouse's income. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, works as an assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ind </LOCATION> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a top fund-raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was an active speaker on the lecture circuit last year, collecting honoraria of $ 90,100. He gave $ 63,575 to charity, keeping $ 26,525, a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed. Among those who gave <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> $ 2,000 for speaking was <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to fly from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> had not listed on his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy $ 100,000 in high-yield <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> junk bonds. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> blamed the omission of an oversight by his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> accountant. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committee, accepted speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential business before the panel. They included the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertilizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Connell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> did a fair amount of traveling at other people's expense to give speeches in 1988 Sometimes, the destinations were resorts. But the only overseas trip was five days he spent in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a trip paid for by Project Interchange. The congressman and his wife spent two nights at <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, paid for by <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>; he visited <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, two times at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and spent three days in <ORGANIZATION> Yosemite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> on a fact-finding trip paid for by the Yosemite Park and <ORGANIZATION> Curry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who suffers from epilepsy, traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> once and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> three times for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epilesy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> He also visited <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> ` Yes I Can' Disability Foundation.''

<HEAD>White House Makes Rare Statement Seeking Lower-Value Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House tried to talk down the value of the dollar Monday, coupling a rare public statement on the subject with apparent <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> action in an effort to head off further foreign trade problems. There was no indication of much quick impact, analysts said. The White House statement, read by deputy press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, said, `` If the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies is sustained for a prolonged period, or extended, it could undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.'' The statement, marking the first time the White House has commented directly on the dollar since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office, was accompanied by a new <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> selloff of dollars in international currency markets, traders and analysts said. And it followed hectic trading in European markets, with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies reportedly selling millions of dollars in an attempt to break the currency's surge. A high value for the dollar makes imported goods less expensive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more expensive abroad, aggravating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The recent rebound of the dollar's value abroad could undo recent improvements in the nation's trade accounts, economists suggested. Despite massive intervention by central banks, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the value of the dollar abroad has continued to surge in recent weeks. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank, began selling off dollars `` about the time of the -LRB- White House -RRB- statement. It was calculated to have a combined impact. Unfortunately, the market is shrugging it off.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> does not comment publicly on its buying and selling activities in financial markets. The White House statement said the climbing dollar `` is a matter of concern'' that `` has also prompted questioning of the administration's commitment to the process of economic policy coordination'' among the Group of Seven major industrial democracies. `` This administration remains fully committed to this process,'' the statement continued. It referred to a pact among <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, to take steps to coordinate their economic policies _ including interest rate changes and direct intervention in exchange markets _ to keep major currencies stable. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> declined to elaborate on the statement, saying it spoke for itself. `` The president and the secretary of the treasury remain the administration's sole spokesmen on the dollar and exchange rate policy,'' he said. The White House statement said, `` We will continue our efforts to strengthen underlying policies that promote the adjustment of external imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as agreed in the April 7 <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> communique.'' The statement, couched in the language of international finance, amounted to a public assertion that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supported additional intervention by central banks to break the dollar's rise. Since the White House usually does not make such comments, the statement appeared designed largely for its psychological impact on traders, analysts suggested. `` The dollar is getting out of hand, so they had to do something. But they're going to have to back it up with action, to spend billions to move dollars around,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based consulting firm. Even an increase in a key interest rate last month by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank _ a move that would usually help weaken the dollar _ failed to have much impact on the dollar's rise. Higher interest rates abroad and lower interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should also help to drive down the dollar. Monday's statement thus re-inforces previous administration efforts to prod the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> into lowering interest rates. The dollar steadied at higher levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday, but dealers said that heavy, repeated central bank intervention had had little impact. The dollar pushed through the two-West German mark level early in the European day, for the first time since December 1986. International finance sources have said that level and one of 140 yen to the dollar are the upper thresholds in exchange-rate ranges agreed to privately by the seven industrial democracies The rise in the dollar above that threshold apparently helped to trigger Monday's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> statement.

<HEAD>Campus Survey Finds Higher Rate of AIDS Infection than Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 College students are testing positive for the AIDS virus more frequently than expected, but at a lower rate than the population as a whole, researchers said Monday. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> showed that 30 of the 16,861 students who sought medical attention in their campus health centers tested positive for the AIDS virus, for a rate of 0.2 percent. Nationwide, researchers believe 1 million to 1.5 million people are infected, a rate of 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent. The study is the nation's first survey attempting to determine the prevalence of AIDS among college students. The testing was done anonymously, and results were not broken out for the 19 campuses selected to represent a cross section of higher education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Of the 30 students who tested HIV positive, all but two were male. Officials did not release the gender breakdown of those tested. No student tested positive at 10 of the schools, while five of the schools had rates of 0.4 percent or higher. The highest campus rate was 0.9 percent. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON>, director of student health services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the 0.2 percent rate is higher than health officials had projected. They had expected it would have been closer to the rate for military recruits. <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said his advice to college students is that `` uninformed, unprotected, unsober sexual activity is highly risky.'' His message to the campuses is that they must be more aggressive about AIDS education, working with students in small groups and asking sensitive questions like: `` What do you say to him when he says he wo n't wear a condom?'' He said college health services must start offering more HIV services, including testing and care for those who test positive, including close medical surveillance of their immune systems. A majority of college health services do not provide testing for HIV infection and only a small number offer anonymous testing, he said. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious, fatal disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. Spread through contact with blood and semen of infected people, its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. A small percentage of cases have been caused by transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. The survey was restricted to students who had routine blood tests done at their student health centers, and <PERSON> Keeling </PERSON> said it was not clear to researchers whether the sample may be overestimating or underestimating the prevalence of the disease on the campuses. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> who worked on the survey, said it is intended to give an indication of the magnitude of the AIDS problem on college campuses and is not an exact figure. The association said it will continue the study during the next academic year and wants include several more schools, including historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> institutions and some with predominantly Hispanic students. The schools included in the survey were: Central Missouri State University-Warrensburg; <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Starkville </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Carbondale </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Boulder </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut-Storrs </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Athens </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas-Lawrence </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts-Amherst </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire-Durham </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas-Austin </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington-Seattle </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Research Says New Approach May Eliminate Mastectomy for Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By shrinking tumors with medicine before surgery, doctors may be able to eliminate most mastectomies as the standard treatment for breast cancer, a leading cancer researcher said Monday. Dr. <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said his study showed that the new approach could eliminate the need for mastectomies in 87 percent of women who otherwise would have had this mutilating surgery. In recent years, doctors have slowly switched to removing just the lump, not the whole breast, when the tumor is small. However, this conservative surgery is not usually considered possible when tumors are large. The latest strategy involves shrinking big tumors first with chemotherapy so they are small enough to be taken out with a breast-saving operation called a lumpectomy, which generally leaves about three-quarters of the breast intact. The chemotherapy is the same as that commonly used after surgery. The procedure was outlined by <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON> at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON> predicted that by 1994, the 100th anniversary of the radical mastectomy, this common operation `` will be very, very rare.'' Surgeons frequently recommend against trying to spare breasts containing larger tumors because too little healthy tissue is left to save and because they fear the cancer will be more likely to spread to other parts of the body. So far, <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON> and colleagues in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have used the new procedure on 97 patients beginning in January 1988. Although none of their cancers have returned, other experts caution that much longer follow-up will be necessary to know whether this approach is as good as mastectomies at saving lives. Despite recent studies showing that for small tumors, at least, breast-sparing surgery appears to be safe, some physicians remain skeptical. `` I think there is still a lot of place for mastectomy,'' because the chances of cure may be better, commented Dr. <PERSON> Hendre </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. While cautious, some other physicians said they found <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON>'s findings intriguing. `` This challenges the conventional treatment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrov </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It may provide a revolutionary change in the treatment of breast cancer.'' Added Dr. <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of Rush Cancer in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>: `` I think it's interesting and exciting and will give rise to a great deal of clinical investigation. Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer of women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The disease strikes one in 10 women at some time during their lives and caused 42,000 deaths last year. In <PERSON> Bonadonna </PERSON>'s study, chemotherapy was given to women whose breast tumors were bigger than three centimeters, or just over one inch. The drugs could bring them down below three centimeters in 87 percent of the women. The largest tumor was over four inches across and was shrunken small enough so doctors could perform a lumpectomy. The average size of the tumors before treatment was two inches. After the operations, the doctors treated the women with radiation therapy and additional chemotherapy.

 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> are trying to find ways to teach grizzly bears to avoid humans and plan to see if a Russian breed of dog used by bear hunters will do the trick.

But recently <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials received permission to see if Russian bear dogs, a breed rare in this country, can be used to scare off bears.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> launched on Monday a rocket named <PERSON> Agni </PERSON>, the Sanskrit word for fire, and became only the seventh nation to develop a ballistic missile of its own. The missile has a range of more than 1,500 miles, enough to reach targets as far away as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the west, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in the east, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the north and islands around the equator to the south, Western military officials said. It can also hit any target in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, with whom <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has fought three wars since they became independent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. Military officials reached by telephone said the missile was launched Monday at <LOCATION> Chandipur </LOCATION>, 750 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. By successfully firing the missile, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in developing its own such weapon. Monday's test was for a range up to about 620 miles, the military officials said on condition of anonymity. One said the guiding system, not the range, was the most implortant factor in the test. `` Agni is not a weapons system,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said in a statement. `` However, the technologies proved in <LOCATION> Agni </LOCATION> are deeply significant for evolving national security options.'' He said the missile accurately followed a predetermined flight path and `` fully met the objectives we had set for it.'' He did not say how far the rocket traveled. It was the third attempt to launch the Agni missile. The first launch date, April 20, was set back by problems with the ignition system. A second date, May 1, was scrubbed because of an error in a subsystem. Western military experts said the 1-ton payload capability means the 7.5-ton Agni could carry a nuclear warhead, but <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> denied the possibility was being considered. `` What <PERSON> Agni </PERSON> does is to afford us the option of developing the ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons with high precision at long ranges,'' he said. `` This provides us with a viable non-nuclear option of the greatest relevance to contemporary strategic doctrines.'' Defense experts say a sophisticated guiding system would not be needed for the missile to deliver a nuclear charge. `` You need accuracy or a point target if you are using a conventional warhead,'' a Western analyst said privately, `` but if you are using a nuclear warhead the exact target does not matter. I am not saying that the Indians are going to use a nuclear warhead, but the question is why not?'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nuclear experts believe its scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in a week. The government says its nuclear program is for such nonmilitary purposes as power generation, and firing the missile was only a `` demonstration of the country's capabilities.'' <PERSON> Agni </PERSON> is the fourth missile <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has developed since 1983. Three surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles with ranges of 20 to about 150 miles also have been test-fired.

<TEXT>
 World tea production last year climbed to a record 2.42 million metric tons, up 3 percent from 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The bumper harvest resulted from favorable growing conditions and new plantings coming into production in several countries, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a report. Larger crops were reported for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Tea output in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> remained at low levels, `` reflecting unstable political and economic conditions,'' the report said. Further, tea production in some areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continue to be affected by the 1986 a <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant accident, the report said. Consequently, the Soviets have had to increase imports to meet domestic requirements. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tea imports in 1988 increased 16 percent to 90,144 tons valued at $ 129 million. Even so, last year's increase to replenish inventories left 1988 total tea imports slightly below the 1986 level of 90,549 tons valued at $ 133.6 million, the report said. `` Preliminary data indicate that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail food store tea sales continued to fall in 1988 as consumers showed their preference for soft drinks, fruit juices and alcoholic beverages,'' the report said. `` However, sales of herbal teas were higher after showing signs of topping-out over the past several years.''

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> announced his candidacy Monday for a fourth term as <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> mayor in typical fashion for the maverick Democrat _ saying he'd seek the nomination of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who twice before has been defeated in Democratic mayoral primaries, said it did n't matter how he got re-elected. `` If it goes like last time, fine,'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said. `` The people, they make the decision, not the parties.'' In 1985, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> lost in the Democratic primary, then switched affiliations and won re-election to a third term on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and Conservative tickets. In 1977, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> lost the Democratic primary and won on the Conservative ticket. State Assemblyman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> is the endorsed candidate for mayor of the Democratic and Liberal parties. He could have as many as four challengers in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary _ <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, state Sen. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Masiello </PERSON>, former Chief City Judge <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> and City Comptroller <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 59, is expected to receive the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sometime this week. The Conservative Party, which supported him in his three previous campaigns, is expected to endorse him Tuesday. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said Monday that when he became mayor in 1977 <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> was `` on the verge of bankruptcy.'' He said its downtown was a disaster, unemployment rampant and its housing decayed. `` Today the city has been brought back to life,'' he said, noting numerous development projects, such as a new transit system, minor league baseball stadium and waterfront projects. The mayor said 23,000 jobs had been `` saved or created'' and that unemployment has fallen to 5 percent from 15 percent.

<TEXT>
 Federal parks along <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s seashores are facing environmental threats ranging from oil spills to the increasing use of all-terrain recreational vehicles, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a report on 31 coastal parks. The conservation group noted the devastation of federal park beaches from the oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but said other coastal parks also `` are fending off a distressing variety of threats that eventually may overwhelm them.'' Among the problems facing these parklands are: _ Tons of garbage and other ocean debris washing ashore on federal searshores and parks each year, including medical wastes and unmarked chemical drums _ Pressure for offshore oil development near the federal land _ Wastewater pollution from nearby agriculture or urban development _ The increasing use by park visitors of all-terrain vehicles that damages dunes and wildlife habitat _ Developers who aggressively are buying private parcels of land within some of the parks, while the government is unable to compete for the parcels because of budget constraints The report by the conservation group said there are no signs the problems facing the coastal parks will ease. `` Tomorrow the problems facing our coastal parks will be more serious than they are today'' unless additional measures are taken to better protect these stretches of federal seashore, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> report said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign minister on Monday said <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and `` fellow martyrs'' who led the failed 1956 revolt against Stalinism were victims of show trials. Another senior communist urged the political and legal rehabilitation of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his associates, captured and executed in 1958 after Soviet tanks and troops violently crushed the short-lived 1956 revolt. The statements reflected growing demands for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s rehabilitation before June 16, the 31st anniversary of his execution, and public questioning of the role of former leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> in <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s demise The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> as saying Monday that it can `` be unequivocally stated that former premier <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his fellow martyrs became the victims of politically inspired show trials.'' His statement before about 400 communists and non-party members at a meeting in the northeastern city of <PERSON> Eger </PERSON> followed a weekend demand from 400 communist reformers for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> to be rehabilitated politically. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> was quoted Monday in the communist party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> as saying `` we definitely have to come to terms with the meaning of 1956 and the role of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'' and his associates. `` There is a need for their political and legal rehabilitation, as well as for the reinstatement of their human dignity,'' <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> was quoted as saying on Italian television Saturday night. A government commission is investigating the trial of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and other revolt leaders, who may be legally rehabilitated when the probe is completed. Political rehabilitation would require the Hungarian Socialist Workers' -LRB- communist -RRB- Party to revise its official version of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s history. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 76, has come under increasing fire since losing the party leadership a year ago Monday. This month, the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> stripped him of his last political posts and said serious mistakes had been committed in his 32-year rule. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> came to power at the end of the revolt, when <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and leading associates were captured and imprisoned. They were executed after summary trials in June 1958 on charges of counterrevolution. Previously buried in unmarked graves in a remote corner of a <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> cemetery, they are to be reburied at a June 16 ceremony expected to draw tens of thousands of sympathizers and to be broadcast live on Hungarian state television.

 A Palestinian was killed Monday by a rock Israelis flung at his car, and gunmen attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and soldiers who were hitchhiking in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. The Palestinian's death was the first reported since residents of southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> began stoning Arab-owned cars after a soldier was found killed in the area two weeks ago. Police blame Palestinians for the soldier's death. At least 497 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising that began more than 17 months ago in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty-two Israelis also have been slain. Concern grew over Palestinian threats to increase the level of violence and start using guns in the uprising, coupled with the army's discovery of an arms cache in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Palestinian farmers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said soldiers bulldozed about 20 acres of Arab orchards and seized the land to build what appears to be a military road along the territory's eastern border with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawa </PERSON>, head of the local <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he complained to military authorities and requested compensation for eight families. Army spokesman said they were checking the report. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops wounded seven Palestinians with gunfire and shot seven others with rubber-coated steel pellets in clashes with stone throwers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Among those injured by the pellets were six women aged from 12 to 55, they said. The stoning victim was identified only as a 42-year-old man from <LOCATION> Dura </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. He was hit by a rock apparently thrown from a passing car near the coastal city of <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Elimelech </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Barzilai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION>, said the man was dead of a head wound when he arrived. An army spokesman said no one was injured in Monday's shooting attacks on Israeli police in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> and soldiers in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraket </PERSON> said unidentified gunmen fired three pistol shots at police near <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. One shot hit the policmen's vehicle, he said, but no one was injured and police arrested four suspects. In <LOCATION> Navatim </LOCATION>, five miles south of <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION>, an assailant driving a truck with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> license plates fired with an automatic weapon at three soldiers waiting at a hitchhiking spot, Israeli radio reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the soldiers ran into a field and the gunman fled. The soldiers were quoted as saying they thought the attacker was an Arab. Police sealed the area, searched with a helicopter and surveillance plane, and arrested dozens of Arab suspects, the radio said. It said all were released after questioning. The arms cache, discovered during a six-day curfew in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, included 18 weapons, pistols, U.S.-made and Soviet automatic rifles, Israeli submachine guns and Swedish <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> rifles, an army announcement said. It was found during the roundup last week of of 250 activists of the Moslem fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB-. `` We are trying to detain as many <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> activists as possible,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said in an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television interview from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> `` is more than anything else responsible for crimes against the Palestinians and the Israelis.'' <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION>, the Israeli news agency, quoted military officials as saying a senior <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> leader in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarar </PERSON>, was detained several days ago in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, urging <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations to `` open their borders to all those who want to fight against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman, said Palestinians had increased the use of firearms and noted that leaflets being distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> threaten to kill an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> for every Palestinian who dies in the uprising. `` We are seeing more use of firearms generally. We see it as a grave development,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said in an interview. He added, however, that it was too early to tell whether underground leaders of the rebellion were changing their policy against the use of firearms. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> paratrooper force raided the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Batir </LOCATION> on Monday and arrested about 20 Palestinian suspects. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television showed blindfolded and handcuffed Arabs sitting in a schoolroom.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that it will crackdown on the testing and detention of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the new policy will take effect as soon as the revised testing procedures are ready in about six weeks. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said that on April 14 the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> `` confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> caused by meat or poultry.'' The case involved a nationwide recall of turkey franks made by <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We have responded by intensifying our sampling and compliance policy to ensure that ready-to-eat products contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes do not reach consumers,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Under the Listeria monitoring program, the agency will increase the number of samples tested each year. Other procedures are being put into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reach consumers until the problem has been protected, he said. Listeria is difficult to control because it can grow slowly on foods under refrigeration, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. The bacteria have the potential to cause serious illness, particularly among those with weakened immune systems such as infants, pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill. However, he said, healthy people are `` essentially at little risk'' from the disease, which can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, headaches and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wo n't consider improving relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> unless it makes democratic reforms and frees political prisoners. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to reject the Soviet military presence, hold a national plebiscite, free all political prisoners, allow free emigration and grant unrestricted access to international human rights monitoring groups. `` I am unalterably committed to a free, united and democratic <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and I will never falter in that support,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks before a group brought to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to recognize the Cuban holiday celebrating independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. He accused <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of squelching basic rights, such as freedom of religion, assembly and speech. `` In response, our demand is plain and simple. Democracy and respect for human rights, not sometimes, not someday, but now.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> should `` free all political prisoners and to conform to accepted international standards regarding human rights. I challenge him to allow unrestricted access to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations monitoring their compliance, and a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tone contrasted with the restraint he has used in talking about the pro-democracy demonstrations rocking <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mentioned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in passing, saying `` It is important that the people of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> know the truth, and we will see that the people of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> do know the truth about their dicator and about the world ...'' `` And totalitarian systems everywhere are feeling new pressures from the people. You see it today on the televisions sets coming out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. We've seen the those beginnings of it in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and many, many other countries around the world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was challenging <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> `` to take concrete and specific steps leading to free and fair elections and full democracy. A useful first step would be to accept a proposed plebiscite in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> has not responded to international calls for a plebiscite in which the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people could vote for or against the communist government that was installed when the Castro-led revolution came to power in 1959. `` This I pledge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Unless <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is willing to change his policies and behavior, we will maintain our present policy toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to speculation that the change in administrations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year might be an opening for a more relaxed attitude toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after the long chill in relations. `` Knock off this wild speculation as just that _ some suggesting that our administration is going to unitlaterally shift things with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. I am not going to do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s re-entry into the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AMerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> would continue unless <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> changed his policies. And he vowed to continue beaming radio broadcasts into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> via the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION>. `` In short, what we want to do is to advance that day when <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> independence day achieves a new and a richer meaning, freedom from the evil of tyranny and oppression, freedom from the economic misery wrought by the communist rule,'' he said. In February, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team that visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> last September reported on allegations of human rights abuses, which the government denied. The investigating team said it received more than 1,600 human rights complaints from Cuban prisoners, including 137 of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

<TEXT>
 British Ambassador <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> appealed on television Monday for the release of 75-year-old Briton <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a World War II pilot believed kidnapped in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> 10 days ago. `` My government does not make deals with hostage-holders,'' <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> said, speaking in Arabic over the Christian-run <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> network. `` There must be something wrong with the mentality of those who kidnap an old gentleman of 75 years of age to accomplish certain objectives,'' he said. `` There's no way any gains would be won from such an abduction.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> disappeared May 13 and a group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Cells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> later claimed it had kidnapped an unidentified Briton. <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> indicated he believed the Briton held was <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who has lived in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with his wife Sunny for more than 40 years. The Cells of Armed Struggle demanded release of unidentified prisoners it claims are held in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in connection with the 1987 murder of leftist <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cartoonist <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said no one was detained or charged with the slaying. <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and all other foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> should be freed unconditionally. Besides <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 17 others are missing _ nine Americans, three other Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian. The longest held hostage is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

The pope said the violence wracking <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was `` linked to the intervention of armed forces of neighboring countries,'' and `` was the responsibility of the entire international society.'' He did not mention specific countries, but among heads of state receiving the letter were leaders of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, who have had forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> arrived Monday and received a warm embrace from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II that ended the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-year ostracism of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The 22-member league holds a special summit starting Tuesday, and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> hinted that he dropped his plans to boycott the meeting despite his opposition to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s presence. His statement came after he met with other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> on Monday. As a 21-gun salute boomed, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, wearing a traditional white djellaba cloak and red fez, hugged <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, who wore a Western business suit. Although differences remain over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and other issues, Moroccan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdellatif </PERSON> <PERSON> Filali </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s readmission `` an important historic event ... that will boost Arab solidarity. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s membership was suspended in 1979 after the late President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> signed the Camp David peace accords with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> reached agreement with the leaders of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to oppose `` any concession at the Arab summit and to boycott it if there was any hint of recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Zine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abidine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> _ flew to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> early Monday to persuade <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to change his mind about skipping the meeting Later Monday, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> flew to the western Algerian city of <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION>, where he was to meet again Tuesday with the three presidents, Libyan television reported. It was not clear whether the summit would be delayed by <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s meetings Tuesday. The Lebanese chair may stay vacant because of the dispute between <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Moslem acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. Their governments have been competing for legitimacy since September, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. A ministerial subcommittee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> met Sunday and Monday but failed to resolve the bitter quarrel. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, initially insisted only <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> attend. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s only outspoken <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> backer, threatened to walk out if only <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> were invited, a conference source said. The source said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` reluctantly agreed'' the summit should ask both men to express their views, but neither would be considered the official representative of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A second ministerial subcommittee met to consider rival working papers on the Palestinian issue submitted by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organisation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> paper complained <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states have failed to pay promised donations of a one-time lump sum of $ 128 million followed by $ 43 million a month to support the uprising in Israeli-occupied territory. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said only <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have paid a total of $ 52 million. He said a possible cause was <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism The preparatory committee agreed to a compromise between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and Syrian positions drafted by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. It was the first substantive Egyptian contribution to the Arab League since 1979.

 Ending the dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over short-range nuclear weapons depends on the timing of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the devices, officials said Monday. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear warheads are deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been insisting on prompt superpower talks on the weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken the stand that such talks can not begin until the Soviets make substantial reductions in conventional weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said both sides `` have a along way to go'' in resolving the conflict before a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit opens May 29. `` Progress has already been made because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is no longer rejecting outright the notion of the talks,'' one source said. `` We still have to work out the timing of when talks should begin.'' He said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seeks a compromise with language making it clear that the talks would begin `` within the foreseeable future and not next century.'' That is in line with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s position that progress in conventional-arms negotiations with the Soviets in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> should lead quickly to talks on the short-range nuclear devices. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said Monday discussions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are centered on conditions for the beginning of such talks. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compromise accepting the talks in principle is coupled with a demand that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> drop its insistence on `` prompt'' talks. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was asked about that and he said the word `` prompt'' `` can have a broad interpretation.'' He declined to elaborate. He said Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> sent a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday outlining the West German position on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s compromise proposal, but he declined to give details of the letter's contents He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would telephone <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday for further consultations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say that as part of a compromise <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would agree in principle to short-range weapons negotiations at some point linked to progress in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks.

<TEXT>
 About 6,000 people gathered at a memorial in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital to observe an annual `` Day of Hate'' marking the mass killings of the former <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government, the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The ceremony took place Saturday at the 129-foot-high <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> shrine in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cheung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> executed 20,000 people, the report said. The report was dated Sunday and seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> Monday. It said hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, Cambodians living overseas and foreign diplomats attended the ceremony. Vice Premier <PERSON> Chea </PERSON> <PERSON> Soth </PERSON> said in a speech that any settlement of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict must guarantee the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> do not return to power. The report said people laid wreaths at <ORGANIZATION> Toul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sleng </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genocide </ORGANIZATION>, an old school building the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> used as a torture chamber. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> overthrew the U.S.-backed government of <LOCATION> Lon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nol </LOCATION> in April 1975. The fanatical communists then tried to fashion a primitive agrarian society by moving people into slave labor camps. More than a million died. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978, drove the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to the Thai border and installed another communist government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the strongest of three guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnamese, whose announced total pullout by Sept. 30 triggered fears of a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return. Disagreement over the future role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> has stalled talks between Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the main non-communist guerrilla leader, and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> account monitored Monday, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told the president of the non-aligned movement, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, in a message last week that he would let the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> run in a general election only as a political party, with no military force

 Conservatives opposed to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s choice of a deputy attorney general are trying to scuttle the nomination before it is sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> has distributed press packets containing material critical of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as part of an effort to persuade <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to nominate the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney for the No. 2 job at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, a moderate Republican who once chaired the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening panel, is accused by conservatives of trying to thwart many of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointees to the federal bench. Representatives of various conservative organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, have privately urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials not to send the nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't see how conservatives can do anything but be in opposition to him becoming deputy attorney general,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The conservative interest groups have enlisted support from Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who has expressed misgivings about <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to question <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s party loyalty, citing the $ 1,000 that <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> donated to a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully last year for senator from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who released copies of his letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wrote that the $ 1,000 donation to the campaign of Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> showed that `` <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> is not truly committed to the goals of a Republican administration.'' The donation `` raises profound questions about Mr. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s commitment to the Republican platform and your own judicial philosophy,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said In his letter, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said his concerns were shared by `` other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> said he has had numerous conversations with officials at the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressing conservative opposition to <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. `` There can be no doubt in the minds of the White house and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> as to where its normal allies stand on the <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> nomination,'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, the attorney general's press secretary, said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s donation to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s campaign was based on personal friendship, not politics. `` This guy is a personal friend, he served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> the same time <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Ethiopian police stopped students from demonstrating in the streets and sealed off both campuses of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ababa </ORGANIZATION>, residents and diplomatic sources reported. The attempted demonstration came three days after President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>'s government crushed a coup led by senior generals, including the armed forces chief of staff and commander of the air force. A diplomat in the Ethiopian capital said by telephone: `` The students gathered inside the campus, but when they tried to go into the streets armed police pushed them back. All the workers were ordered off the campuses and police remained at the gates.'' He said there were conflicting reports about the purpose of the demonstration. `` The students were singing. Some people say they had demands to present to the government. Others say they were supporting last week's coup attempt. I am not sure which. I do n't speak Amharic,'' <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s official language. A Western diplomat, also speaking on condtiion of anonymity, said details of the demonstration by a few hundred students were sketchy, but that some carried banners critical of <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>. He said there were reports that police beat students with truncheons and some injured ones were taken to the hospital. An <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> resident told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> both campuses were quiet in the afternoon, and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s official media had not mentioned the confrontation by 7 p.m.. Last week's coup attempt began Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> left for a visit to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> It was crushed Friday with the surrender of the 150,000-man 2nd Army in <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, capital of northern <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. The government has not mentioned casualties and has announced only the deaths of three generals: <PERSON> Merid </PERSON> <PERSON> Negussie </PERSON>, chief of staff; <PERSON> Amha </PERSON> <PERSON> Desta </PERSON>, air force commander, and <PERSON> Denissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulto </PERSON>, 2nd Army commander. Initially, the government said they were killed by soldiers loyal to the government. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>, who hurried home Wednesday night, told a weekend rally in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> they committed suicide rather than surrender. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> also indicated the generals were unhappy with the government's conduct of the wars with rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province, and with his Marxist rule. `` There were often cases when our forces were whistled back when they appeared to be on the brink of victory,'' he declared. Unitersity students demonstrated frequently against Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> before <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> and fellow officers seized power in 1974.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members boosted their income last year with speaking fees, investments and money from such other sources as jewelry making and TV residuals, disclosure forms showed Monday. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid off at least $ 105,000 in debt but may have had to dig into personal assets to do it. The most common addition to congressional pay was in fat fees from interest groups in exchange for giving speeches. Almost all House members have outside investments, some substantial. Some earn money from previous careers _ including pensions. Some moonlight. For example, Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, D-Colo., a Northern Cheyenne Indian, earned $ 5,000 last year for his jewelry designs Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> player, received deferred income totaling $ 45,000 from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Bullets and <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> He also reported $ 10,000 in income for renting space and equipment to his re-election campaign. The disclosure forms filed annually by all 535 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provide a look at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' outside income and the wealth _ or lack thereof _ of each member. Each form lists a member's money received, his assets and liabilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reports were released last Friday. House members are limited to earning an additional 30 percent _ or $ 26,850 _ in honoraria for appearances. Most lawmakers donate anything over that to charity. The forms do not provide precise data on congressional income, listing only ranges. For example, properties worth $ 52,000 and $ 98,000, respectively, both would be listed in the $ 50,001-to - $ 100,000 range An asset worth millions could be listed simply as more than $ 250,000 unless a member chose to spell it out. This often shrouds the true wealth of an individual member but does provide a guide to where that lawmaker derives investment and other income. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has been under investigation for allegations that he used his leadership position for financial gain, got out of debt in 1988, according to his disclosure statement. His debt: Somewhere between $ 105,000 and $ 200,000 was paid off, leaving <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with no financial liabilities. His assets: Somewhere between $ 31,005 to $ 100,000, compared with a range of $ 155,000 to $ 435,000 in 1987. But the current accounting does not include holdings in the blind trust he established in 1987. House members' homes also need n't be listed. The financial disclosure statements show that honoraria _ generally fees for outside speeches _ were an important part of the incomes of many of the 435 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, supplementing a federal salary which in most cases comes to $ 89,500. House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the third-ranking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrat, doubled his salary last year with $ 90,100 from 53 paid speeches To get under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ceiling in honoraria, he gave $ 63,575 to charity in 177 separate donations. House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> reported income of $ 165,865 to $ 180,864 and assets of $ 165,000 to $ 400,000. He earned twice the $ 30,000 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned in speaking fees, giving $ 30,900 out of the total $ 60,500 to charity. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> listed some of the side benefits of taking part in charity golf tournaments: $ 966 worth of golf clothing and paraphernalia from the Bob Hope Desert Classic, the Kemper Open, the Jerry Ford Invitational and others. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., reported income of $ 134,250 to $ 138,250 Most of the excess over his $ 99,500 leadership salary came from fees for speeches. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was among many House members who accepted trips. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> picked up the air fare and hotel tab for travel to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to attend a conference. House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who said his assets are no more than $ 45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988 from his book, `` Window of Opportunity.'' A complaint is pending before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee in connection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote the book. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches to various groups. <ORGANIZATION> GOPAC </ORGANIZATION>, a political action committee chaired by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on 14 trips by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and three by his wife. Here is how some lawmakers _ including two former actors and a major league pitcher _ added to their congressional incomes in 1988: _ <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, reported $ 20,021 in residual income from the `` The Love Boat,'' the long-running series in which he played Gopher. _ Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, D-Ga., reported $ 11,212 in residuals <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> appeared on the `` Dukes of Hazzard.'' _ Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunning </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ky </LOCATION>., a former pitcher, got a $ 350 royalty check from the <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., was reimbursed by a variety of groups last year for two sweeps across <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and trips to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> Expenses also were paid for seven trips inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While 1988 was a story of income enhanced for many <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, some did less well. Rep. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, D-Tenn., lost nearly $ 68,000 when his investment in a trust fell from 118,355 to $ 50,461 `` A partnership trust that he was in went bankrupt,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Wadsworth </PERSON>. The disclosure forms call for listing gifts valued at $ 100 or more. Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, D-Ind., listed as gifts `` zero things and zero money. Among <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' assets: A Great Dane, `` Friend,'' housebroken and listed as priceless and a cocker spaniel, `` Annie,'' not completely housebroken and listed as a current liability.

<HEAD>Parliament Debates Bill On Letting Blacks Join Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislators opened debate Monday on a bill to let blacks serve in the Cabinet while remaining excluded from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The government says the aim is to bring a black into the Cabinet for the first time, possibly as minister or deputy minister in charge of black education. The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supports the bill but parties to its left and right oppose it. The measure would allow the president to appoint people to the Cabinet even if they were not members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Parliament includes a chamber for Asians, a chamber for people of mixed-race, and the dominant white chamber. The black majority has no formal role in national affairs. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber, said during Monday's debate that he knew of no prominent black leaders who supported the bill and described the government move as `` tokenism.''

<HEAD>Thailand Complains Burmese Troops Enter Thailand Pursuing Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> complained to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Monday about a large-scale incursion of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops who were attacking <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels, the government spokesman said. Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops trying to attack the rebels from the rear intruded into northern <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> province Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai border police found the bodies of six <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> soldiers after pushing the intruders back with artillery fire, officials said Monday. Government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmanee </PERSON> said Director General <PERSON> Thep </PERSON> <PERSON> Devakul </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political department summoned Burmese Ambassador <PERSON> Nyunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Swe </PERSON> and lodged a protest. He said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> demanded compensation. `` So long as they stay inside their borders we consider that a Burmese affair. Once they come into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, it is our policy to drive anybody back, Karens or Burmese,'' <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> said. The military government in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last year killed hundreds of Burmese in crushing a popular uprising for democracy and vowed to destroy the Karens, an ethnic rebel group that has fought for 40 years for greater autonomy. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said Burmese soldiers over the weekend intruded into <LOCATION> Ban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wangkaew </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, about 235 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, and attacked the rebel camp of <LOCATION> Kaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ra </LOCATION>, which is separated from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Thai officers said the soldiers were driven back before dawn Sunday. They said six bodies were found. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> sources claimed 60 to 65 Burmese soldiers were killed in fighting Saturday and many wounded. Five rebels were killed and 11 wounded, they claimed. One Burmese student fighting alongside the rebels was killed and another wounded, they said. Government forces began their attack on Ko Moo Ra on Thursday, after overrunning the major rebel stronghold of Wangkha two days earlier. Rebel officials say the loss of five key border crossings since the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> intensified their offensive last October has severely disrupted the black market trade that has sustained their insurgency.

 Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial disclosure statement, released on the eve of a crucial hearing into his alleged rules violations, touches only lightly if at all on money deals that led the ethics committee to charge the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker. <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON>, the investment partnership that sparked many of the 69 ethics charges against the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democat, is mentioned but once _ in the liabilities section with the notation that a loan was `` satisfied during 1988.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made no mention of royalties from his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The ethics committee has accused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of a `` scheme to evade'' outside income limits by selling the book previously. There is one brief mention of <ORGANIZATION> Jewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, a company that went under after disastrous nursing home investments, causing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other investors a substantial loss. The speaker listed stock in the bankrupt company as an asset worth less than $ 5,000.'' The ethics committee was scheduled to hold an unusual televised hearing on Tuesday on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s longshot motion to dismiss the most serious charges against him, as the speaker sought a badly needed victory to counter a losing public relations battle. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a hard-nosed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lawyer brought in this month to bolster <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s legal defense, will take the lead role in the hearing and spent Monday preparing his case. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> is expected to argue that the ethics committee stretched House rules beyond their intended meaning when it charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 violations. The panel's special outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, will defend the committee's interpretation of the rules. A ruling on the motion to dismiss charges was expected later this week. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has often owed substantial amounts, used 1988 to work his way out of debt _ listing no liabilities at yearend, according to the statement released Monday along with those of other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. His income was between $ 188,183 and $ 203,579 and his assets ranged from $ 31,005 - $ 100,000 These figures, however, do not include holdings in a blind trust established by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1987. Those figures were not available. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid off debts totaling between $ 105,000 and $ 220,000, including money he owed to <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> and a bank. The special counsel to the ethics committee said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> satisfied these notes with money he made from his share of an oil and gas investment that is still under investigation by the panel. The speaker earned $ 170,000 as his share of the deal, his most profitable financial transaction. Mallightco bought and later sold its interest in the prospective <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> oil and gas well along the Texas-Louisiana line. The well turned up dry. There was no trace of the deal on the disclosure form. <PERSON> Mallightco </PERSON> was owned by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, their partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s wife _ until the speaker pulled out of the partnership last year. The ethics committee said there was `` reason to believe'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received gifts from <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> who, according to the panel, had a direct interest in legislation. The disclosure showed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received between $ 5,001 and $ 15,000 in oil and gas royalties from Southeastern Resources in 1988. As in previous years, he held 57 acres of land in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, valued at $ 5,001 - $ 15,000, and real estate in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, worth between $ 15,001 and $ 50,000 <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> profits to satisfy his debts left him with fewer assets than a decade ago. The speaker's 1978 disclosure form showed holdings of between $ 72,000 and $ 170,000. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defense against the ethics charges will be that the rules were changed in <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyers are expected to argue Tuesday that the two most serious sets of charges should be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moral climate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent. But his lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied, and they give the speaker less than an even chance of winning a preemptive dismissal of the charges.

 About 50 villagers from <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> have gone on a hunger strike in front of the federal Parliament in the capital to protest harassment by police and communist authorities, an activist said Monday. Also Monday, 80 workers at a food-processing company in <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> said they were fasting, and about 2,000 others protested to demand back the jobs and pay they lost because of a huge financial scandal, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <LOCATION> Bosnia </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. The group from the Bosnian village of <LOCATION> Mosevac </LOCATION> began their hunger strike Saturday demanding the release of local youth activist <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Delic </PERSON>, who was arrested May 13, said activist <PERSON> Dzevad </PERSON> <PERSON> Galijasevic </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Dalton Phases Out Competitive Preschool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents who were crestfallen when their bright toddlers were rejected by a prestigious private preschool can take heart: The <ORGANIZATION> Dalton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> now admits it was never really able to pick the best brains. School officials, sensitive to the feelings of those distraught parents and frustrated by their inability to judge the academic competence and character of toddlers, have decided to close the preschool. `` It's difficult enough to select good students when they're 17 and 18. It's almost impossible to make distinctions _ except on the edges, if they're extraordinarily brilliant or retarded _ when they are 2 -LCB-,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickenden </PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>'s admissions and scholarship committee and a former dean of admissions at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. New Yorkers hunting for the fast lane to the right track for their children will now have to wait for kindergarten to begin their frantic push to get their youngsters into <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>. The board of trustees voted last month to phase out the nursery school over the next two years as the 34 children who enter in September at age 3 proceed to kindergarten. School spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnabuci </PERSON> said the process had become something of `` a rat race.'' The competitive admission to <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> was lampooned in the movie `` Baby Boom,'' when a mother tried to cope with her daughter's rejection `` I do n't understand,'' she said. `` Her resume was perfect, her references impeccable.'' For parents, their offspring's failure to get into an elite nursery is `` their wonderful little child's first rejection,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, who provides advice on how to get into the city's elite private schools `` It wo n't be as heartbreaking when they do n't get into <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>.'' Admissions director <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said there were almost six times as many toddlers trying to get into the preschool as there were openings and no reliable means for judging the little applicants. Ms. <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said the decision was based on watching a child play for 45 minutes with three other toddlers and talking with the parents. Often, family affiliation and space limitations were the deciding factors, she said. <PERSON> Wickenden </PERSON> said school administrators decided it would be better to admit students when they are older, when test scores and other information are available to help make better decisions. Kindergarten applicants are judged by their scores on the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> test, a standardized admission test, as well as their records from nursery schools and interviews, Ms. <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wickenden </PERSON> said a greater percentage of students who entered at age 2 -LCB- had to be asked to leave the school in later grades because of poor performance than did youngsters who were admitted at the ripe old age of 5 or 6. `` The hope would be by delaying the admission process by 1 -LCB- years, it would be fairer and the school could strengthen the academic excellence of those admitted,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Sirgay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, did n't buy those arguments. `` If you have a headache, you do n't cut off the head,'' he said. Instead of abolishing the program, the school should improve its selection process, especially since preschool programs are in such demand by working parents, <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said. Children can be judged at an early age if they are studied carefully over an extended period, not in a 45-minute interview, he said. `` They can have off days and on days and you need to see them at different times.'' For parents who had their heart set on sending their preschoolers to <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, there should be some comfort in the knowledge that <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> has about 115 private nursery schools, with about 4,500 slots for 3 - and 4-year-olds, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, an association of private schools and parents `` In September there will be no 3-year-olds sitting out on the street with nowhere to go to school,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, who is of mixed race, married his white girlfriend, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, in a ceremony conducted by an Anglican minister at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison on May 10. They decided not to publicize the marriage at the time and did not want the bride's maiden name disclosed, said the reporter who wrote the story The couple reportedly met almost daily over the past two years, communicating through a glass window at the prison. At his trial, <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said he carried out the bombing on his own and feared punishment by the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> for violating its directives against hitting civilian targets. The blast killed two whites and an Indian. Most of the injured were white. No execution date has been set. <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>'s wife was quoted as saying she hoped the sentence would be commuted. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that two black trade unionists on Death Row were reprieved by <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who commuted their sentences to 20-year prison terms. Seven other prisoners are scheduled to be executed this week, according to an organization of human rights lawyers.

<TEXT>
 A man charged with conspiring to ship explosives to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1981 to help depose then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was framed, his lawyer argued Monday. Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> made the allegation during opening arguments in the long-awaited trial of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>. The case has generated protests from current leaders in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> is considered a hero. More than 100 Philippine lawmakers have urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to block the prosecution, and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> interceded personally to get <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> freed on $ 200,000 bail. The president's brother-in-law, Sen. <PERSON> Agapito </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, has said he will seek removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> is convicted <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>, 57, a Greek-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, has denied any role in bomb-making and has said he is being prosecuted because of a vendetta against him by the local <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and federal prosecutors. He declined to make any statement Monday. Prosecutors said pieces of explosive detonator cord, bomb-making materials and shipping documents were found in a search of garbage at <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' home in December 1981. But <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> told jurors <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> was framed. `` It was planted there, and the question is by whom?'' He said <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> `` never purchased, never sent, never transported and never received detonating cord in interstate commerce without a permit.'' In a news conference outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> had become the target of threats by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> agents and supporters. `` He was told somebody was going to get him, and he was told that repeatedly,'' he said. <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON> drew heated objections from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> when he tried to detail events in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the'70s and'80s, said that <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' co-defendant, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, is now a mayor in a Philippine city, and described <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' efforts to persuade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> agents were committing crimes here. <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> has remained in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> said the prosecution will play two wire-tapped telephone conversations between <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> doctor active in the anti-Marcos movement. In the calls, he said the men used the code terms of `` 50s and 60s and 30s'' to refer to explosive detonator cord and its size. Shipments of explosive cord from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were picked up at a bus station by a friend of <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>, he said, then delivered to someone in the <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> said investigators searching the <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> home found a letter addressed `` Dearest Buddy,'' discussed `` BCs'' or blasting caps, `` stripping the rope,'' a process used to get the explosive material from the detonator cord, and a shortage of `` powdered sugar.'' He said the letter, typed on <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' typewriter, was signed `` Steve.'' <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Presentacion </PERSON>, comes from a prominent Philippine family allegedly robbed of its riches by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The couple moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1973. After <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> went into exile three years ago, <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> a hero. <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> was indicted secretly in December 1986 and arrested the following July on arrival at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. If convicted of conspiracy and aiding and abetting in the shipment of explosives from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> faces up to 15 years in prison and $ 20,000 in fines.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Guinness Book of Records on Monday announced it is scrapping its gluttony section because eating a whole ox in less than 42 days could make you sick and because the world is more health-conscious. `` If you have witnessed one of these competitions, they are simply gross,'' said editor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlan </PERSON>. `` We now regard these records as unhealthy and outmoded, in the light of growing concern about health issues worldwide.'' <PERSON> McFarlan </PERSON> decided to drop 43 gluttony records from the book's 1990 edition, due out in autumn They include records for consuming beer, prunes, eels, eggs, gherkins, ice cream, pancakes, spaghetti, sushi and snails. The book, the world's best-selling after the Bible, has carried a health warning for several years pointing out that attempts to break gluttony records `` must be regarded as extremely inadvisable.'' No one has ever died while attempting to break a gluttony record, as far as the publisher knows. <PERSON> McFarlan </PERSON> hopes people will try to break more socially acceptable records, so new categories are planned for the 1990 edition, including the most cars converted to lead-free gasoline on a single site. Only one gluttony entry, greatest omnivore, will remain `` for its historical and nostalgic value,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The record holder is Frenchman <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotito </PERSON>, whose diet since 1966 has included 10 bicycles, a supermarket cart, seven television sets, six chandeliers, a coffin, and a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> light aircraft. As for ox-eating, <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketzler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> set the meat-eating record when he ate a roasted one in 42 days in 1880.

<HEAD>Dynamite Couldn't Bring Tower Down Despite Being Deemed Structurally

<TEXT>
 Neighbors of a high-rise apartment building were kept away Monday while demolition experts worked out plans to bring down the building that would n't fall. `` We told you so,'' said a grass-roots neighborhood organization which had argued the building and two others were solid enough to be renovated for low-income housing. More than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36-year-old building down Sunday, although a second round of explosives knocked out the first two floors, leaving the main part of the building and a wing leaning against each other. Two businesses in the area remained closed and four homes evacuated. Police posted a 14-man detail around the building, and traffic was rerouted. The neighborhood organization, Project BASIC, had tried unsuccessfully in federal court to stop the demolition of the 10-story <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> building, claiming it was structurally sound. Group officials said they hoped the failure of two blasts to bring down the building would help their case when they try to stop the demolition of two other 90-unit buildings in the project. `` It makes our position better,'' said group spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hempfer </PERSON>. `` We will be submitting this as evidence.'' `` Some people might find this amusing,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, head of the city's housing authority. `` To me it's a nightmare.'' `` Why did n't it fall? That's an open question,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the explosives expert who coordinated the blasts. `` I knocked out the two floors I wanted to knock out and, by all indications, the building should have fallen.'' `` It's the way it's built,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` It's built like a honeycomb.'' Earlier this month, an 87-year-old grain silo in <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, came down only after repeated blasts with more than 700 pounds of dynamite. The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> decided to switch from explosives to a wrecking crane, which will begin work Tuesday, said <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, who said the process could take up to two weeks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettine </PERSON> had allowed the housing authority to continue with its plans to raze the building after engineers testified the 2,300 holes drilled in the building to hold the dynamite had made it structurally unsafe. During a hearing earlier this month, a housing authority engineer testified that the building probably would not withstand a 40-mph wind, said Project BASIC. Project BASIC had argued that the low-rise units slated to replace the building would not provide enough affordable housing to compensate for the lost units. The failed attempt to bring the building down `` clearly demonstates the structural integrity of the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> highrises,'' the group said in a statement. `` We told you so.'' `` Given the strength of these buildings, they can and should be rehabilitated and occupied by families and individuals in need of safe, decent and affordable housing,'' it said. <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, however, said the structural safety of the building was not at issue. `` They were coming down for sociological reasons, to lower the density of the site,'' he said. A hearing on Project BASIC's attempt to stop the demolition of two other <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> buildings was scheduled for June 6.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should consider passing legislation to restrict the power of states to limit corporate takeovers. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said the state and federal partnership governing securities laws is undergoing a severe test because of a growing tendency by states to pass restrictive laws asserting state control over outside takeover attempts of local companies. In remarks prepared for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> conference on corporate financing, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has stated previously the agency's belief that anti-takeover statutes passed by state legislatures in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> were unconstitutional He said he believes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could eventually be forced to address this question by limiting the power of states to restrict takeover attempts. `` Limitations on the free transferability of securities of corporations that are owned by shareholders nationwide diminish the efficiency, depth and liquidity of the nation's securities markets,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said. `` Federal law should control in this area by pre-empting state statutes that unduly interfere'' with the buying and selling of securities, he said. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who announced last week that he was stepping down as <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman to return to teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s law school, said that unless state legislatures on their own stop passing antitakeover legislation, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should enact restrictions.

<HEAD>Armed Men Attack Relief Train, Rob Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 100 armed men boarded a train carrying 1,500 tons of emergency food supplies to the war-ravaged south and robbed three relief workers, a government statement said Monday. It said three Western relief officials were robbed of their `` personal belongings'' but were not harmed, and the gunmen left without touching the food supplies. It did not give the names or nationalities of the officials working with the U.N.-sponsored relief project. It reported the robbers boarded the train Sunday about nine miles north of <LOCATION> Malwal </LOCATION> and said they were searching for foreigners. After holding the three officials briefly as hostages the gunmen left and told the train crew to continue the trip to <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, according to the statement. It gave no other details. The train started the journey Saturday after a delay of more than a month, caused in part by crewmen who feared making the trip through the embattled area without an armed escort. It left <LOCATION> Muglad </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, a town 180 miles farther south that is controlled by government troops. The train, with 48 freight cars, is scheduled to drop off the loads from 32 cars in <LOCATION> Malwal </LOCATION> and Maput, two rebel-held towns between <LOCATION> Muglad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>. It had been schedluled to depart April 15. A further delay was caused by government objections to the plan to deliver food to areas held by the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Organizing the shipment is Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, which is part of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort to help some 100,000 people threatened with starvation. The $ 132 million project was planned to stockpile 100,000 tons of food in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> by the end of this month, but less than half of that amount has been delivered. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the operation is a race against time. Seasonal rains that begin in May turn roads and airfields into quagmires. The southern rebels, mainly Christians and animists, have been battling for more than six years for greater autonomy and more economic development from the central government in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The government and northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are predominantly Moslem.

But <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese legislature, also told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that restoring order in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be the first priority and no progress can be made toward promised reforms during the current upheaval. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> met with the vice president and later with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> during an 11-day visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He refused to comment on the situation despite persistent questioning by reporters, and was described as `` very careful'' in his talk with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He was careful to position himself on either no side or every side of this thing,'' in that meeting, said the administration official, who said also that <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> was careful to point out that most of the tension in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the imposition of martial law has occurred since he left the country for his trip. However, <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> did say that before he left the country several days ago, `` They agreed not to use violence,'' against the demonstrators, said the source. His visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> came as more than 100 top military leaders vowed Monday to refrain from entering <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to suppress the demonstrators who have seized control of the capital. Also Monday, members of <PERSON> Wan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began gathering signatures needed to open a special session on the legality of martial law, sources said, indicating a further erosion of Wan's support Early Tuesday, witnesses said soldiers clashed with crowds at one intersection. Witnesses said soldiers hit people with sticks and belts, but did not open fire. The incident appeared isolated. One report said 15 residents were injured. The administration declined immediate comment on the violence, in part because it was unclear whether the incident was ordered as part of a strategy or was just an isolated occurrence, said one official. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, asked about the matter, told reporters during a photo session with Wan that he hoped for a nonviolent solution to the Chinese strife. `` We support the advancement of democracy, freedom and human rights around the world,'' he said. `` We certainly hope that the public demonstrations that have gone on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and continue will be successfully concluded without any violence.'' During his meeting with Wan, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> underscored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` interest in human rights and democratization worldwide, and the hope that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would continue its political development and economic reforms,'' the vice president's press office said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday to stop settling Jews on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and to give up any aspirations of annexing territories captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day war. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in a speech to an American Jewish group, said, `` Now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' He also called on Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government to reopen schools on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> closed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities attempting to cope with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising. `` Reach out to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as neighbors who deserve political rights,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in the speech to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a private research and lobbying group holding a convention here. At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> to abandon `` the illusion of control over all of Palestine'' _ meaning <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> apart from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. He also urged the Arab world to end its economic boycott of the Jewish state and to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` as a neighbor and partner in trade and human contact.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s speech, which he gave before meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, represented a hardened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stance toward <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> while also appealing for concessions from radical Arabs. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not `` dictate an outcome'' to the negotiations <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> hopes will spring from a proposal by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections among Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we do have an idea about the reasonable middle ground to which a settlement should be directed.'' He then proceeded to stake out a position on many controversial issues, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s control of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. He said Palestinian self-government in the territories would provide `` ample protection'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not explicitly rule out retention by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of some of the territory, as <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and several other leading Israelis say is essential to deter another Arab attack. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stressed that Israelis ought to get used to the idea of a negotiated settlement that `` will in all probability involve territorial withdrawal and the emergence of a new political reality.'' In terse terms, he told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>: `` Forswear annexation. Stop settlement activity. Allow schools to reopen.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not support creation of an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, talking to reporters after a 70-minute meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said schools in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> were open with 200,000 students in attendance. But on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official said, `` we learned that once schools are opened the confrontation between kids and the military forces of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> increase the number of casualties among youngsters.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he had not read <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s speech, which was delivered about an hour before their meeting. But he said the key question at the moment was whether <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would engage <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in negotiations as proposed by <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` We learned that once a peace process starts it has its own momentum,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. The Israeli official said he and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> concentrated on how to get elections going and `` how to remove the threat of terror'' that keeps Palestinians from participating in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said many Palestinians `` realize that what <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered is a unique opportunity'' but they were holding back out of fear of assassination. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s two-step plan involves electing Palestinian leaders to negotiate temporary self-rule and then holding negotiations among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on an overall settlement.

<TEXT>
 Tiananmen Square has become a garbage-strewn encampment for students demanding more freedom and a symbolic field of battle in the political struggle within <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership. A citizen said late Monday night, while manning a roadblock to keep soldiers out of the the city: `` Every four years you have elections in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and change your government. Every 10 years we have riots and change ours.'' The main political combatants are Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who is cool to political reform and appears to have support from <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 84-year-old leader; and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, known as a relative liberal. Both have tried to manipulate the students. Under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s orders, according to reports, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has equated the movement with `` turmoil'' and tried to give the impression of strong leadership by crushing it. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has tried to use the discontent as a springboard back into the favor of both people and party. Neither has succeeded. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> ordered martial law Saturday, but the soldiers surrounding <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have yet to enter the city. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> won points with the people by visiting hunger-striking students last week, tears in his eyes, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources say he has lost support in the party. Those apparent failures introduced two new elements: the military and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, seven leading generals expressed opposition to martial law and said the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> should not enter <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongzhen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangqian </PERSON>, the nation's last living marshals, said Sunday night the army would not suppress the students. Their announcement in all official media clearly limited <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s order, which gave the military the right to taken any steps necessary to restore stability. The military appears to be saying it is not willing to be used as a pawn and wants the political squabble to stop. Also Monday, sources said representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, were collecting signatures on a petition for a special meeting to consider the legality of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s martial-law order. The Science and <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that 24 deputies sent a letter saying the disturbances should be ended `` by democratic and legal methods.'' Students and intellectuals have been part of other political power struggles in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history, such as the 1956 Hundred Flowers campaign and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution by the radical left. A brief student campaign for democracy in the winter of 1986-87 led to the downfall of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a relative liberal whose death April 15 inspired the current movement. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is a sea of rumor and innuendo, with no free press to help sort it out. Within one week, various sources have reported that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and three others had seized power, that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had resigned, that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had stepped down and that President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> was preparing a coup. To that confusion can be added the contradictory tone of the official press. On Monday, the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> carried both an editorial favoring the crackdown and a story criticizing martial law. The student movement is largely a product of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s opening to the West and his economic reforms. Students know of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> uprising that ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> three years ago and about student protest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It would be difficult to close <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> again. Lacking a victory by one of the three top leaders, a vacuum at the top could result. Right now, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> appears weakest because he declared martial law but could not enforce it. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s position has not been strong for months. He has been blamed for record-high inflation and an overheated economy, associated with his policy of introducing elements of a market economy in the state-run system. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has been is shaken because 11 years of popular economic liberalization were not accompanied by political reform. `` Right now the stage is empty,'' a government source said. `` All the people in the audience are on their feet clapping for a new leader, but no one is coming out. I think this is a tragic moment in our history.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Monday it is studying a response from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to a proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compromise on the issue of short-range missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said the response, received Monday afternoon, had been discussed with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said he had `` no details or characterization'' of the latest proposal to cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` It is being studied,'' he said. However, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the issue was `` still unsettled.'' The official said the reply had neither advanced nor lessened prospects for a settlement. `` We're not home yet,'' the official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday voiced optimism that the U.S.-West German dispute which has split <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would be resolved before the alliance's 40th-anniversary meeting begins next Monday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> The flap centers on whether to negotiate with the Soviets on reducing the size of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arsenal in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The West German government, responding to heavy political pressure for disarmament, has supported such talks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has generally held that <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on the weapons should begin until the East's superiority in conventional arms is erased. Last Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side gave West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> a compromise offer that West German officials privately said opened the door to eventual U.S.-Soviet negotiations. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who spent the weekend in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the president's oceanside retreat, said Saturday the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> stance was `` too vague'' for a deal. The Germans thus far have insisted on leaving open the option of eliminating all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact short-range missiles in any negotiations. Under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, meanwhile, negotiations would be held only after <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations agreed on cuts in conventional forces that would reduce the East's superiority. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> called the issue a `` NATO-wide issue, and it's one that affects all members, and all members have a view on it, and of course, all views are welcome.'' `` The issue will be worked and hopefully will be resolved before the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit so that we can have a successful <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit,'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Striking Doctors Set Up Clinics Outside Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Striking government doctors treated patients at makeshift clinics outside major hospitals and distributed free medicine Monday as negotiations continued to end the week-long walkout for more pay. Dr. <PERSON> Rohit </PERSON> <PERSON> Parasher </PERSON>, a strike leader, said the clinics were established `` as an expression of our deep anguish and concern for our patients.'' About 5,000 doctors went on strike last Tuesday, and government hospitals began turning away many patients because of the lack of staff. <PERSON> Parasher </PERSON> said more than 4,000 people have received treatment at the clinics set up in tents outside nine of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s 11 hospitals. Medicine will be provided free, and the clinics will be operated until the strike ends, he said. A Health Ministry official said negotiations are under way, but he declined to give details. Earlier wage negotiations ended in deadlock May 15, and the next day more than 3,500 doctors in <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> left their jobs. About 1,400 doctors at government hospitals in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pondicherry </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Banaras </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Aligarh </LOCATION> joined the strike. The strikers are seeking pay raises, higher allowances for not being allowed to have private practices and firm schedules for promotions. Most are junior staffers and nearly all are resident physicians. Emergency cases are been handled by senior doctors. The strikers want a montly increase of $ 53. They now receive between $ 200 and $ 269 per month. They also seek an increase in the monthly allowance for not having a private practice from $ 16 to $ 40. Government doctors are barred by law from having their own practice.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators on Monday rejected a bid by one of the nation's most profitable savings and loans to switch its insurance coverage from the fund that backs thrifts to the more healthy one that insures bank deposits. The application by <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which rejected the institution's claim that it was exempt from a temporary ban on defections from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Great Western, the nation's second-largest FSLIC-insured institution, had filed an application claiming it was eligible to convert from coverage by <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> to insurance with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The application was seen as a test case on whether regulators would allow widescale defections from the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, although several smaller S & amp; Ls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts' insurance fund The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is considered the more attractive insurance fund because it retains big assets while the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has been largely depleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry. Legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leaving <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> until Aug. 10, 1988, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has since extended the moratorium until Aug. 10, 1989. Thrifts that had already converted to <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> or announced their intention prior to March 31, 1987, to covert by merging with an FDIC-insured bank were exempted. Under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 157 billion proposal to restructure and rescue the thrift industry, institutions would be barred from leaving the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> for another five years. The provision is designed to help the fund recuperate and to ease the costs of the bailout. Regulators and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had been concerned that widescale defections from <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> could cut the fund's intake of insurance premiums and make the S & amp; L rescue even more expensive. Great Western applied to leave <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> based on its October 1988 application to merge with the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, an FDIC-insured institution. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrift also cited its March 1987 memorandum of intent to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> and Loan in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The bank board rejected Great Western's application to merge with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> thrift and said the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> memorandum was not valid because no further steps to combine with the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> thrift had been taken since the agreement was signed. Great Western, which had assets of $ 30.8 billion as of Dec. 31, issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the bank board's ruling `` We are confident that under existing law and regulation, Great Western's program for <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> membership meets every test and we intend to vigorously pursue all options available to us,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive. The company did not elaborate on what its options might be.

 Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip, supplemented his salary by giving speeches and collecting rent on property in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, his financial disclosure forms showed Monday. The lawmaker's income ranged from $ 123,525 to $ 136,025 in 1988. His base salary was $ 89,500, boosted by rents of $ 5,000 to $ 15,000, honoraria after charitable donations of $ 26,525 and interest from a federal credit union of $ 2,500 to $ 5,000. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, whose personal finances have recently drawn public attention because of what he said was an error in his 1986 financial disclosure form, put most of his assets in a qualified blind trust in June 1988. At the time, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat's holdings were worth $ 65,000 to $ 150,000, with the largest investment _ a rental duplex in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, _ valued at $ 50,000 to $ 150,000. The assets that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> kept out of the blind trust include another rental property in <LOCATION> Merced </LOCATION>, valued at $ 50,000 to $ 100,000, and savings accounts, money market accounts and individual retirements accounts worth $ 25,000 to $ 80,000. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> listed no purchases or sale of property, stocks or bonds in 1988, but he did refinance his principal residence in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs. That arrangement allowed him in October to pay off loans of $ 80,000 to $ 200,000, the forms show. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> satisfied a commercial loan of $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 line of credit from <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the same line of credit from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also sent his trustee, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehler </PERSON>, a check for $ 60,000 for inclusion in his blind trust last November, according to an amendment filed to his 1987 financial disclosure. He did not say where the money came from; his aides said they would ask. Excluding his blind trust, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was left with one liability, a 50,000 to $ 100,000 mortgage on his Merced rental house from the Tracy Savings and Loan institution. Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, lawmakers are not required to reveal any details of transactions dealing with their principal residence. Another exemption is details of a spouse's income. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, works as an assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ind </LOCATION> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a top fund-raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was an active speaker on the lecture circuit last year, collecting honoraria of $ 90,100. He gave $ 63,575 to charity, keeping $ 26,525, a few hundred dollars short of the maximum allowed. Among those who gave <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> $ 2,000 for speaking was <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage house that also picked up the tab for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to fly from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> had not listed on his 1986 disclosure forms a loan he obtained to buy $ 100,000 in high-yield <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> junk bonds. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> blamed the omission of an oversight by his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> accountant. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committee, accepted speaking fees from a number of groups that could have potential business before the panel. They included the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertilizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Connell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> did a fair amount of traveling at other people's expense to give speeches in 1988 Sometimes, the destinations were resorts. But the only overseas trip was five days he spent in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a trip paid for by Project Interchange. The congressman and his wife spent two nights at <LOCATION> Marco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, paid for by <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>; he visited <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, two times at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, and spent three days in <ORGANIZATION> Yosemite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> on a fact-finding trip paid for by the Yosemite Park and <ORGANIZATION> Curry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who suffers from epilepsy, traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> once and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> three times for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epilesy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> He also visited <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the `` <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> ` Yes I Can' Disability Foundation.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday suggested both <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact be disbanded. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> states propose disbanding both military alliances at the same time, starting with disbanding of their military forces,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the full appeal to members of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would be published in Soviet newspapers Tuesday. It is not the first time East European officials have broached the idea, but Monday's statement comes one week before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting that finds the 16-nation Western alliance divided over the depth of changes in the Soviet threat. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> advocates talks on the elimination of short-range nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say no such talks are possible while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies have overwhelming superiority. A compromise reportedly is in the offing on the question of nuclear arms talks, but fundamental differences remain within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is more concerned with eliminating the possibility of a destructive East-West conflict on its territory, since even a war that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wins would likely be disastrous for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has offered the possibility of an undivided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> free of nuclear threat. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Monday the East European alliance was suggesting expanding arms negotiations to all weapons systems, including navies. He said the appeal was being made because times have changed since the post-war era when the two alliances were formed. East European officials have offered the hypothetical possibility of dissolving the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> once <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is disbanded, and <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> mentioned simultaneous dissolution years ago. The topic has arisen recently in talks by Hungarian officials contemplating neutrality.

<TEXT>
 A jury was seated Monday for the trial of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, who is accused of having sex with an underage girl. Prosecutors and defense attorneys spent seven hours selecting the jurors, who will hear evidence on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor. Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON> challenged defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> in court to explain his decision to excuse the only black potential juror. The girl who made the allegations against <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is black. <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> said he excused the woman because her husband works for the state; there were other jurors who he believed would be more appropriate from the defense's point of view; and because the potential juror appeared to be `` living in a vacuum.'' <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> was referring to her statement that she had absolutely no knowledge of the case despite widespread media coverage. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, a 58-year-old conservative Republican, was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, and previously served from 1967-71. In between, he ran unsuccessfully for governor and served in the state Legislature. A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, indicted Feb. 23, had offered to plead guilty to the charge, but the prosecution would not agree to his condition that references to any sexual contact with the girl be removed from court documents. Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> said he would consider requests by Ms. <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON> that only limited testimony be allowed from the girl regarding two other cases in which she is involved as a witness and that her juvenile record not be introduced. The defense maintains the evidence is needed to establish or question the girl's credibility. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who has repeatedly has denied the allegations and accused the girl's mother of setting him up for extortion, did not comment to reporters Monday. Columbus television station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1 broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that showed <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> apparently offering a government job to the girl's mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, after she asked him why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter. In the tape, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> told Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> he did not know her daughter was a teen-ager. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine.

 Prosecution briefs unsealed Monday for the perjury trial of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> show the government hopes to show that he plotted how he would lie publicly about a shady loan deal. In one brief unsealed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the eve of juror questioning, the prosecution argues that public statements <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> made after his allegedly false grand jury testimony are relevant to the case because they point to `` a continuation of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attempts to limit his own potential criminal exposure. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, is accused of lying under oath in 1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, an associate and now-admitted money launderer, and `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>,'' actually <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, a federal agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison. The indictment contends he lied in concealing from the grand jury his discussions on how the movement of money would be concealed to protect him. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs, lost his seat last November to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> An attempt at a speedy trial before election day collapsed after jurors received <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> campaign material proclaiming his innocence in the mail. In the brief, the prosecution says it wants to enter as evidence statements <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> made in later interviews and news conferences which are `` clearly false,'' as shown by a tape-recorded phone conversation between the congressman and the agent. At one point in that conversation, the agent, posing as a broker funneling <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> money through <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> as middleman, asked the congressman what he would say if anyone started asking questions. `` What's wrong if I say I sold the note to someone <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> introduced me to and I do n't know what his name is and I really did n't care,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> replied. `` There's no question in this transaction that I am basically using <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> as my buffer,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said in another conversation related in the prosecution brief. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorney wants to prevent any use of post-grand jury statements by the congressman, on the grounds that they are not relevant to the issue of whether he lied to the panel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> unsealed several motions and trial briefs after objections from news organizations. But two other government briefs must remain secret because they contain `` highly sensitive'' information not previously reported in the media, he said. Since potential jurors might read or hear new news reports, there is a substantial chance that reporting on the sensitive information might taint the jury, <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> ruled. The judge set aside Monday for 75 potential jurors to fill out questionnaires and for lawyers on both sides to study them. Courtroom questioning of the potential jurors is expected to begin Tuesday. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> has said he wants to see if an impartial jury can be seated before ruling on <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s request to move the trial out of town because of prejudicial publicity.

<TEXT>
 Two men accused of helping stage the state's biggest bank robbery go on trial Tuesday in a case in which authorities say one witness was murdered, another died of unknown causes and jailed suspects plotted to kill other witnesses and flee to the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. `` I've been wracking my brain, trying to find a way to summarize it for the jury,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. `` These people are just too zany,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said of the defendants. `` They've been watching too much television.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, 43, of <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>'s Branch, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 27, of Lovely, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, go on trial Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy to commit bank robbery and intimidating witnesses. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> also faces a murder charge in the shooting death of <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who was part of the robbery gang. The <ORGANIZATION> Matewan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kermit </LOCATION> was robbed of more than $ 286,000 on Jan. 3, 1987. Authorities say <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> masterminded the heist, in which he was joined by <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> `` Boonie'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, shortly after the robbery and agreed to become a government witness A few days later, authorities say, <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> took him to the top of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mountain and shot him in the head. `` He was a threat to us,'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said Friday in pleading guilty to the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> killing and to a charge of conspiracy to commit robbery. `` There was no reasoning with him. We took him to a hill and shot him.'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> buried <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in a shallow grave on <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky </LOCATION>. The body was not discovered until last February. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> were indicted by a federal grand jury in March in the robbery, and a murder charge later was added against <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was not charged in the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> killing. <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, who had been scheduled to stand trial with <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, could be sentenced to life in prison on the murder count and five years for the robbery charge, plus $ 500,000 in fines. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, 30, of Beauty, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a friend of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> who appeared before the grand jury, was found dead in his car. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkle </PERSON> said Monday the cause of death still has not been determined but said foul play is not suspected. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> and four others _ including <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s son _ were charged May 6 in an alleged plot to break <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> and another man out of jail, kill five witnesses and help the prisoners flee to the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the six asked an imprisoned burglar to kill the trial witnesses and then help them break out in return for $ 20,000 in cash and $ 100,000 in counterfeit money.

<HEAD>EPA Understates Smog Problem, Environmentalist Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> routinely understates the severity of the smog problem in urban areas because it relies on too few monitoring devices, a private environmental group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said that in many large <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities unhealthy levels of smog are twice as frequent during the hot summer months as <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates would indicate. Last March the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> released 1988 air pollution figures that showed ozone pollution, which is a chief component of urban smog, as being the worst in a decade and `` clearly the most pervasive air pollution problem'' the country faces. The agency indicated nearly 100 areas of the country have unhealthy levels of ozone pollution during at least some periods of the summer. Nevertheless, according to the environmental group, those <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> statistics reflect only a fraction of the ozone pollution problem, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>. The environmental group said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates of days in which there are unhealthy levels of smog in an area are often based on smog readings from a single monitor. `` This approach seriously underestimates the extent of the smog problem in most large urban areas,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, an attorney for the environmental group and a former assistant administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>'s assertions. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said that an analysis conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> showed that unhealthy levels of smog occurred about twice as often in many American cities than the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> statistics suggest. In urban areas in most parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and across some areas of the Southeast and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> smog levels were found to be considerably worse than implied by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> reporting, he said. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said the group counted the number of `` smoggy days'' in 1987 and 1988 in 48 large urban areas and found the levels higher than the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> suggested, based on its monitoring system. For example, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, metropolitan area had 54 smoggy days, compared with 21 cited by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> during the time period; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, had 18, instead of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> figure of 10.5; and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> had nine instead of the two in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> should halt all contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until it lifts martial law and acknowledges that the anti-government demonstrations are patriotic and democratic, 60 legislators said in a statement Monday. The lawmakers from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We should suspend our policy of opening up toward the mainland until the Chinese Communists lift martial law and end any military crackdown.'' They said they will submit their statement to the Legislative Yuan -LRB- parliament -RRB- for discussion Tuesday and then relay it to the Cabinet. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-heng </PERSON>, a 35-year-old clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, began what he said would be a three-day hunger strike to protest `` Taiwanese indifference'' to demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who are demanding democratic reforms. Students at some universities in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have signed petitions supporting the demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but there have been no large rallies. People protesting the Chinese government actions rallied Monday in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. About 150 Chinese students living in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> staged a peaceful protest in front of the Chinese Embassy in the Hague. Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> advised Dutch nationals not to travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of the unrest. His warning followed the weekend cancellation of a planned state visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> and her husband Prince <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>. Hundreds of Chinese students in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> held rallies in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. About 300 demonstrators crowded into the courtyard of the Chinese consulate in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. Some burned photographs of Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Police blocked the entrance to the consulate building. There was no violence. A similar rally was held in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, where demonstrators called for the removal of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaping </PERSON>, and the lifting of martial law. The Foreign Ministry in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> told Australians planning trips to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to wait until the situation becomes clear. The Taiwanese legislators said the Nationalist government should offer to open direct trade and shipping links with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cancels the crackdown and accepts the protests as patriotic and democratic. The Nationalists fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 when they lost the civil war to the Communists. The island's government has refused to have any direct contacts with the mainland authorities. But in the past two years it has followed a flexible policy that allows Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits and trade through third countries. Legislator <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-wen </PERSON>, who initiated the statement to the government, said a military crackdown could set back democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by 20 years and `` we would miss a good opportunity to reunite peacefully.'' The Nationalists say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, considered a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> province by both the Nationalists and Communists, should be reunited under a democratic system. Martial law was lifted in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1987 after it had been in force for 38 years.

<HEAD>1973 Bias Case Against Navy Goes To Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Testimony began Monday on a federal lawsuit filed in 1973 alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> discriminated against black civilian workers in promotions at <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> is hearing the non-jury trial, which may involve up to 450 witnesses and 4,000 exhibits in the case that became a class-action suit after it was filed. Attorneys for both sides estimated the trial may take up to 12 weeks. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said if it is not over by the end of June, he will have to recess it until September because of other court business. The lawsuit was filed by six blacks in 1973 after their complaints were rejected by their bosses. One of the six workers has died since the lawsuit was filed. Ten years after the case went to court, it was declared a class action, with the outcome potentially affecting 1,200 to 1,700 blacks who work or have worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rework </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>. To win, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> must prove there was a sweeping pattern of sometimes subtle personnel decisions that promoted white workers ahead of more qualified blacks. `` We think the promotion process is a largely subjective procedure. When you have that kind of subjective decision-making, discrimination can enter the process,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, one of the lawyers with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has denied any discrimination and also has defended its system for evaluating and promoting civilian workers. If <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> decides the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has discriminated, another trial would be needed to determine which employees were treated unfairly and how they should be compensated. The plaintiffs in a subsequent lawsuit could seek back pay and promotions, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` It's a big case, and when you litigate against the federal government, they have a lot of resources,'' he said. A variety of reasons are behind the 15-year delay since the original 1974 trial date. A major issue has been the changing nature of how civil rights employment laws apply to the federal government. That resulted in years of delay until the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> clarified the application of the law, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. In addition, the two sides haggled for years over what information they were required to give each other. Government attorneys `` aggressively litigated'' the case, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. And for several years, only one federal judge was available in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and he was required to put criminal cases ahead of civil actions.

<TEXT>
 A crime hot line that won a volunteerism award from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just a month ago is on the verge of closing its doors for lack of contributions. `` We happen to be one of those thousand points of light that the president is talking about that is now about to flicker out,'' said <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who runs the Drop-A-Dime service from an office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section. `` It's an operation where when the money comes in it's just about spent. ... We need serious money.'' Drop-A-Dime has been taking anonymous tips about drugs and other criminal activity since 1983. According to police, one in 12 anonymous tips from Drop-A-Dime results in arrests. Last year, the organization received more than 2,000 tips about drug activity, gangs and weapons. In February, <PERSON> Drop-A-Dime </PERSON> passed on a tip about a high school student carrying a gun at school. The tip led to the arrest of an 18-year-old carrying a loaded 9mm handgun. `` We ca n't afford to lose an orgnization like <PERSON> Drop-A-Dime </PERSON>,'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said. `` Policing in this country will never be effective without groups like that. The information we have gotten from the group has been very fruitful, and I fully support <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Drop-A-Dime </PERSON>'s original $ 700 annual budget has jumped to $ 120,000 as the operation has become more sophisticated, but it was down to its last dime by the end of March. Now its organizers are dialing for dollars trying to make it through the last two months of the fiscal year. The tip line, known officially as Drop-A-Dime - Report Crime, <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, handles between 300 and 600 calls per week. In April, <PERSON> Drop-A-Dime </PERSON> received a citation signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The award was for volunteer action since Drop-A-Dime has only two salaried employees, including <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, and uses about 10 <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> volunteers for much of its work. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> says she will have to decide by the end of this month whether to hang up the service for good. `` Since April, I've been paying the small bills out of my own pocket,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. The organization relies largely on private donations from banks and private corporations for its annual budget. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said some donors apparently gave to other projects this year. `` Some have given us less this year, and others nothing at all. I guess some have chosen other issues, like homelessness or AIDS,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also chips in $ 20,000 each year and this year provided an emergency infusion of $ 3,000 as cash dwindled. Next year's $ 20,000 installment will not come until late summer or early fall. The Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, a co-founder of Drop-A-Dime as well as a minister and assistant clerk magistrate, said he wrote Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> asking him to support a proposal requiring police to allocate some assets confiscated in drug-related arrests to groups such as Drop-A-Dime. `` If Drop-A-Dime has to turn off its telephones because this city's public officials failed to support, then I am forced seriously to question whether the ` war on drugs' is a reality,'' he wrote.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Monday her government was not strong enough to risk allowing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return _ dead or alive. She has refused to let the ailing, 71-year-old deposed president return from Hawaiian exile to die in his homeland and has ruled out burying him here. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained in critical condition Monday in a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital after suffering renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure last week. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said on Monday that the country is recovering from 20 years of abusive rule by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, but the recovery is still too fragile to risk allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come home even in death, she said. `` Let's say a person has been ill for 20 years and now, after three years, he is slowly recovering,'' she told reporters. `` Just because he is growing stronger does not mean you are going to expose him to infection.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> recalled how anti-Marcos groups exploited the 1983 assassination of her own husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was slain at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport moments after returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to challenge <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> The killing stirred such outrage it led to the popular uprising that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in 1986 and forced him into exile. `` I appealed for peaceful demonstrations,'' she said. `` I appealed to them not to engage in violence. Will all of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers do the same thing We can not allow anyone to create trouble or we will be fighting again. We can not allow these things.'' The president conferred on the issue Monday with her <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and later officials said the ban on the former president remained.

<HEAD>11 Arrested in Los Angeles Strike, `Reform' Contract Reached in Boston</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A teachers' strike in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> went into a second week Monday with 11 arrests and a break in talks, while negotiators in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> agreed on a contract school officials called a landmark in educational reform. The arrests were the most in one day during the walkout that has crippled education in the nation's second-largest school district. They occurred after a rally at which more than 10,000 teachers hoisted picket signs and cheered wildly when <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called school board members `` desperate, despicable people.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> accused board members of lying when they say the district can not afford to meet teachers' demands for a 26 percent raise over three years, including 10 percent in the first year. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> tentatively agreed on 7 percent pay increases for teachers for each of three years despite warnings from officials that the city can not afford it. The contract, which requires ratification by the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the union, comes at a time when <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has proposed tax increases and spending cuts to balance the state budget. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he did not believe money would be available to support the contract, but he supported provisions aimed at decentralizing school management. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, president of the 6,000-member teachers union, said the contract would give teachers greater control over the schools, would reduce the power of seniority and would hold teachers more responsible for the performance of their students. In a joint statement, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> called the pact a `` landmark.'' Union and school officials noted, however, that it was modeled after teachers' contracts in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which gave teachers a greater stake in how school systems are run. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, school district police arrested 11 people for investigation of roadway obstruction and trespassing during a sit-in outside district headquarters. Ten teachers, including two union vice presidents, were arrested along with a 17-year-old, said district spokeswoman <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. School board President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> emphasized after the breakdown in talks that the district had boosted its offer of a 21.5 percent pay raise over three years to a 24 percent raise over three years, contingent on extra state funding. Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said he did not know why talks collapsed Sunday night. `` I am led to the conclusion that the union, and its officials particularly, were looking for any reason to break it off,'' he said. Education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians went on strike May 15. The district claimed a small gain in student attendance Monday, following a week of losses. There were 293,482 students in class, up 34,362 from Friday. The district has more than 550,000 students.

<TEXT>
 Three senators want President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to give top priority to blocking a return to power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the communist group blamed for more than a million deaths during its 1973-78 rule. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., sent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a letter that also urged rejection of a proposal for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms aid to non-communist guerrillas in The weekend letter, obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to settle the debate between two groups of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislators and experts. Both agree the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> should be stopped from returning to power and the argument is whether the various proposals would help or hinder this. `` We urge you to make unconditional <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and support for a diplomatic settlement your top priorities, rather than a new program of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lethal assistance,'' the senators declared. The other side favors arms aid for the non-communist Cambodian factions to strengthen their hand in future power-sharing negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is under study. White House reaction to the senators' letter was not immediately available. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy for settlement of the decade-old war includes safeguards against future <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> domination, along with self-determination for the people and total withdrawal of the Vietnamese military forces that invaded in 1978. The three senators voiced concern that Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the West's choice to head a future <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> state, `` remains allied with the murderous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' They added that `` any military assistance at this time simply would reinforce <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and discourage him from attempting to reach a diplomatic settlement which excludes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We do not need to remind you of the genocide committed by the Khmner Rouge ... nor do we need to remind you that the incredible brutality of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> continues today in the refugee camps its forces control in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and inparts of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' the letter said. But <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s backers have argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> can be controlled more effectively as part of an alliance. The senators also said any military aid provided <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s and other non-communist <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> groups `` invariably would fall into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' and would also increase civil strife.

 Israelis lit hundreds of bonfires Monday night to celebrate an ancient Hebrew victory over the Roman occupiers of the Holy Land. The bonfires of the Lag Ba-Omer holiday, which ends at sundown Tuesday, commemorate the fires lit by the soldiers of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Kochba </PERSON> who led Jews in a rebellion against the Romans between 135 A.D. and 138 A.D.

Another legend says <PERSON> Akiva </PERSON>'s disciples died fighting the Romans. Israeli children often make bows and arrows during the holiday to re-enact the battle.

 `` The Blessing,'' the new play at the off-Broadway American Place Theater, conveys the message that mothers should not object if a daughter becomes a lesbian. But in the telling, playwright <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Coss </PERSON> has made her story long, unpleasant, tedious, inconsistent and boring. <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> plays a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> woman in a spacious <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> old-age home who has periods of confusion, but most of the time complains loudly that she wants to live with her daughter. The photographer daughter, played by <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>, experiences guilt but realizes she'd have to hire full-time caretakers for her mother. She patiently accepts her mother's abuse during weekly visits. The daughter's supportive lawyer roommate-lover, <PERSON> Nan </PERSON>, is played by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, who was the original brash <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> in `` A Chorus Line.'' The playwright has the mother proclaiming aspects of her own personality, some of them news to everybody else on stage.

 More than 100 military leaders said Monday they will not order their men to confront or suppress the masses of people who seized control of the capital to demand democratic reform. Student leaders on Tuesday considered ending their 10-day occupation of Tiananmen Square. Soldiers clashed briefly Monday night with residents 15 miles from the square, but no shooting was reported. Other troops withdrew from streets in southern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, ending standoffs with local residents who have surrounded their convoys and blocked their movement. Students who have guided the tumultuous pro-democracy movement over the past month expressed concern that many <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students were leaving and that half their numbers were now students from outside the city. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student leader <PERSON> Gua </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON> said some leaders want to pull out because of the increasingly squalid conditions and the lack of clear-cut results from the occupation. Others argued they should stay until they achieve victory in their struggle with the government, stressing that the students still have the strong support of city residents. About 45,000 people were on the 100-acre square Tuesday morning. A soldier from the western province of <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION> praised the students' `` revolutionary, patriotic, democratic movement'' in a speech over loudspeakers. A mother was seen weeping in the arms of her daughter, pleading with her to come home. The promise by the military not to attack protesters represented a serious blow to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and other hardliners who have tried to quell the huge demonstrations. Sources said members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, began gathering signatures needed to convene a special session on the legality of martial law, indicating a further erosion of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s support In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities were jamming its broadcasts, apparently trying to cut off one of the demonstrators' main sources of information. It was the first reported case of jamming since before diplomatic relations were restored in 1979. Soldiers withdrew from streets in southern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to end standoffs with residents who had surrounded military convoys for the last three days. Army trucks and armored vehicles remained deployed elsewhere in western and southern parts of the city, but the mood was generally relaxed. State television quoted an officer as saying he was told to withdraw because of the widespread opposition to martial law. Residents and soldiers clashed briefly in one area when the soldiers tried to move to a nearby army storage facility. People surrounding the trucks tried to block their path and a battle with rocks and bricks began. An unconfirmed report said a soldier was killed, and one report said 15 residents were injured. A Chinese journalist said about 2,000 soldiers participated in the clash. The confrontation, which ended at about 1 a.m. Tuesday, occurred 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where tens of thousands of students have held round-the-clock vigils in defiance of martial law. Citizens have set up barricades throughout the city to keep soldiers from moving on the students. What caused the clash was not clear. Witnesses said soldiers hit people with sticks and belts but did not open fire. The witneses said some soldiers pushed through throngs of residents trying to block their way but that military vehicles did not advance. There were new signs of internal political struggle. The letter from military leaders, which was sent to the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was drafted by seven prominent military figures, a source at the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said The seven include former Defense Minister <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> and former army Chief of Staff <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dezhi </PERSON>. `` As old soldiers we have the following demands,'' the letter said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> belongs to the people. It can not confront the people, even more so it can not suppress the people and it will never shoot the people. `` To keep the situation from worsening, the army can not enter the city.'' The letter was signed by 100 other officers, said another source. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s inability to enforce martial law indicated an intense power struggle. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> emerged as a hardliner during the protests and appeared to have won a power struggle with Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was more sympathetic to the students' demands Chinese sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has resigned in protest, but no official statement has been made and his whereabouts and status remain unclear. The students began leading the protests on April 15 to demand talks with the government on bringing democratic reforms and ending official profiteering. But now the students _ bolstered by widespread support their movement has won from the populace _ are pressing for the resignations of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. The protests reached a zenith last week during the historic visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose social reforms are admired by reform-minded Chinese. Students began a hunger strike May 13, two days before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival. The populace embraced the students' cause and poured into the streets, resulting in crowds estimated at more than 1 million. Under martial law, the city government banned marches, strikes, class boycotts, the spreading of rumors and any criticism of leaders. The bans were widely ignored. Foreign reporters were told they could not conduct interviews, take pictures or make tapes or videos on the streets, in work places and at several other locations.

 A record promoter pleaded guilty Monday to three charges involving payola, and admitted giving cocaine to a <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> radio employee to win air time for songs by <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> and other artists. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to a misdemeanor payola charge for sending the cocaine in a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> envelope to the radio station program director. He also pleaded guilty to two felony charges of filing a false corporate tax return and obstructing a grand jury investigation. <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said he sent less than a gram of cocaine to the <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> program director to encourage the broadcasts of records by <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Branigan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> was the first person convicted under amended 1960 payola statutes, which outlaw the exchange of gifts for radio time, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavin </PERSON>. Three counts of tax violations against <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON>, were dismissed last week. Judge <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON> agreed with a defense motion that the couple was the victim of vindictive prosecution, and labeled the government's prosecution `` reprehensible.'' As part of a plea agreement, other counts in a 175-count indictment filed against <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> will be dismissed. But <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> must testify before any federal grand juries or trial juries. Defense attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> has not been subpoenaed to testify, and refused to say if <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> would testify against his ex-boss, record promoter <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Isgro </PERSON>. The plea agreement also allows <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> to withdraw his guilty pleas if Ms. <PERSON> Rymer </PERSON> sentences him to more than nine years in prison and a $ 265,000 fine at his sentencing set for July 31. The government agreed not to use <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>'s testimony against him in any future prosecutions unless he has perjured himself or unless he withdraws from the plea agreement.

 The city Board of Supervisors on Monday unanimously approved the nation's first law allowing live-in lovers to register their partnerships publicly. The law, which also is intended to extend health benefits to `` domestic partners'' of city workers, was opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> but hailed by homosexual couples, who can not legally marry, and heterosexuals lovers who do n't want to wed. The law, which passed on a 10-0 vote with one supervisor absent, requires a routine second vote May 30 before going to Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who has promised to sign it. The supervisors also voted 10-0 to direct the mayor to form a task force to examine how health benefits could be extended to domestic partners of city employees. A few other cities have adopted policies extending health benefits to live-in lovers of municipal employees. But <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> would be the first to allow any non-married couples in the county to register their relationships like traditional couples file marriage licenses. The `` Declaration of Domestic Partnership'' form would be filed with the county clerk for a $ 35 fee. `` I hope that other cities around the country ... will be looking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of the way people live,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>, author of the measure and a leader of the city's politically powerful gay community <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> played down worries by <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> that people from other cities might swarm to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to get their relationships legitimized. He emphasized that the law's benefits would apply only to partners of city workers, but urged that its spirit be adopted in all spheres. `` My hope is that people will go to their unions, they'll go to their employers, they'll go wherever in society people are given some sort of benefits, and be able now to say, ` This is the person I love' and be dealt with fairly,'' he said. In addition to health benefits, live-in lovers of the 25,000 city workers would be entitled to bereavement leave and hospital visitation rights. `` This is long overdue,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was the lover of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Milk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s first gay supervisor, who was assassinated in 1978. `` Our relationships are just as valid as non-gay relationships.'' The law, which defines domestic partners as any `` two people who have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed relationship,'' is not binding on private businesses. But proponents say the city's policy could lead to changes in many areas. `` This is only the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Coles </PERSON>, a lawyer who helped draft the law and worked on similar measures adopted in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> also has such a law. Private employers, though, remain skeptical. `` My impression is that companies are not eager to stretch benefits that far,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morten </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> worked against a similar plan vetoed by then-Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> in 1982. The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesolek </PERSON> of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> recently called the law `` a frontal assault on marriage and the family as we know it.'' Deacon <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of the Archdiocese said he was not surprised by the vote. `` I think our hope would be that they might reconsider,'' he said. The church is opposed to the `` pseudo-marriage'' provision of the legislation, although it supports the extension of civil rights benefits and health coverage, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> added. Another clergyman said the law would have a positive impact on the AIDS crisis. `` We need to support gay couples in stable relationships, not promiscuous sex,'' said Episcopal priest <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromey </PERSON>. Some of the city's employees worry their health-care premiums could rise if the cost of insuring domestic partners, including AIDS patients, drains city funds. Health and insurance officials say the newly eligible people will pay their own way with monthly premiums of about $ 150. In <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, 7.5 percent of the city's 1,450 employees have sought coverage for domestic partners under its health plan. Eighty-five percent of those couples are heterosexual.

<HEAD>Government In China Mainly A Party Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Among the byzantine maneuverings of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political system one thing is clear _ power is strictly a party affair The main premise in Chinese politics is that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decides and the government does. Decisions are generally made by consensus among party leaders. The legislature, or <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has little pull, and direct elections as known in the West are practically non-existent. The decision-making process is made murkier by the role of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> holds only one official post, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and has withdrawn from an active day-to-day role in running the country. But there has been no question that when critical matters arise, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s word is final. That ultimate authority may now be on the line as opposition grows to the imposition of martial law, believed done on <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s orders, to put down student-led unrest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The general course of the nation is adjusted about every five years when the 47 million-member party convenes its national congress of about 2,000 delegates. The congress, however, merely reflects decisions made by the 175-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which meets in full session at least once a year, and the 17-member Politburo, the nucleus of party power. At the core of this nucleus is the five-member Standing Committee of the Politburo. At <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s bidding, the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is now balanced with two advocates of reform _ party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON> _ two more conservative politicians _ Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> _ and one fence-sitter _ <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s executive wing is the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, led by the premier and three vice premiers and including 41 ministers. All are party members and the ranking officials, such as <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and the vice premiers, are Politburo members. Despite promises to separate party and government functions, the party still has a decisive say in a broad spectrum of policy areas. This is even more the case with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a body of almost 3,000 which meets for about two weeks once a year to vote on legislature and formally appoint members of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It also fills the largely ceremonial post of president, or head of state, now held by retired Gen. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent years has tried to shed its image as a rubber-stamp body by allowing more debate and seeking more say in shaping legislature. The congress, or more exactly its 163-member Standing Committee, which is responsible for its day-to-day operations, has managed to alter or delay some controversial bills. But senior leadership in the congress, called the `` highest organ of state power,'' is again dominated by the party, and all important legislation emerges from policies set by the party. Under the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are people's congresses at various district and provincial levels. Citizens have a direct vote for the lowest-level county congresses, although the candidates must generally be approved by the local party offices. The local congresses, consulting with the party, appoint delegates to provincial-level congresses who in turn nominate delegates for the national congress.

 Two brothers who ran with spy <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> went on trial Monday in the slaying of the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer killed in the line of duty, and a defense lawyer conceded their involvement. Pellets from a shotgun carried by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> struck <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Jake </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, causing him to bleed to death, <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, told jurors. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement officer who helped track the two suspects for 20 hours through deep snow. <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said he would n't challenge much of the prosecution's evidence, thus avoiding lengthy technical testimony from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> experts, but contested circumstances that would warrant the death penalty under state law <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> suggested the defense would try to show that the <ORGANIZATION> Pratts </ORGANIZATION> fired in self-defense at pursuers, and that <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was acting as a volunteer, not as a law enforcement officer in the manhunt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and his brother <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Sandpoint </LOCATION>, are charged with first-degree murder and 16 other felony counts stemming from an abortive Jan. 11 burglary. The Pratts gained notoriety in 1982, when their testimony helped send escaped spy <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> back to federal prison. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, whose sale of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> satellite information to the Soviets was chronicled in the book `` The Falcon and the Snowman,'' had escaped from prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and taken refuge in northern <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Kootenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury that the Pratts were the two black-clad figures who burst into a tavern owner's home on Jan. 11, intent on robbery. They briefly took a hostage from among the nine people in the home, fired shots at a pursuing sheriff's deputy, and shot it out with <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> and a deputy when cornered in a ravine the evening of Jan. 12, <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said `` If they thought they were master criminals, they were kidding themselves,'' <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said of the robbery that netted little of value. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, reserved his opening statement until after <LOCATION> Bonner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has presented his case. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he intends to seek the death penalty if the Pratts are convicted of murder. <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> asked jurors to `` use your common sense'' when deciding whether the shootout was a continuation of the burglary and robbery of the night before, or a separate series of crimes. If the jurors find that <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was shot as part of a robbery or in his capacity as a law-enforcement officer, they could find the <ORGANIZATION> Pratts </ORGANIZATION> guilty of first-degree murder, which is punishable by death.

 <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, who has spent more than four months sealed in a cave, learned Monday evening that her isolation experiment was almost over. She heard a human voice, laughed and said it was like an alarm clock. Minutes after Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> was notified on a computer screen that the experiment would end Tuesday, she heard another person's voice for the first time in four months and nine days `` <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON>, I'm your God talking to you,'' experiment coordinator <PERSON> Maurizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> said over an intercom. The 27-year-old Italian woman looked at a video camera trained on her, laughed and said: `` I did n't think you would find me down here.'' Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> woman has been living 30 feet underground since Jan. 13 without sunlight, clocks or other ways of measuring time. On May 4, she guessed it was March 7, though she said she might be two weeks off. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> broke the news first by typing it in Italian over a computer connected to Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s. `` <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON>, a real adventure does n't stop. It never ends,'' he wrote. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> frowned and watched the screen. `` You have lived 130 days in temporary isolation,'' <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> wrote. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> watched the screen, stone-faced. `` And now, the adventure continues,'' <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> wrote. `` You are returning on your trip to eternity.'' Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> continued watching the computer screen, expressionless. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON>, who once spent six months isolated in a cave, explained to the 40 reporters clustered around two TV screens that she was having trouble believing what she was reading. Finally, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> typed in a reply. `` How come?'' she wrote, an uncertain smile on her face. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> assured her he was telling the truth _ the experiment was over. `` Are you really serious?'' Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> wrote that the end of the isolation experiment meant the end of daily, boring mental and physical tests. With that, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> laughed and clapped her hands, and <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> talked to her over the intercom. After several verbal exchanges with the various Italian researchers, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> remarked that `` the feeling she had was like when the alarm clock goes off on Monday morning,'' interpreter <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraschini </PERSON> said. The isolation set a duration record for women. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> universities cooperated with <PERSON> Montalbini </PERSON> and other researchers from his and Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Ancona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The experiment in 30-foot-deep Lost Cave in the hills of west <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> simulated some of the effects of interplanetary space travel. In the absence of clocks and sunlight, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s sleep-wake cycle has been altered radically. She tends to stay awake 20 to 25 hours and sleep about 10 hours. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>'s menstrual cycle has n't helped her guess at the passage of time because it stopped in the absence of light days and dark nights, researcher <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvagno </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON>, an interior decorator, has coped with the isolation by livening up her 10-foot-square Plexiglas living area with colorful figures cut out of construction paper and glued to the plastic walls. She also reads, plays solitaire and keeps in shape with calisthenics and judo moves. Monday morning, eight hours before she was scheduled to find out she was coming out Tuesday, Miss <PERSON> Follini </PERSON> appeared to be cutting out figures for another poster. Occasionally, researchers summon her to perform computerized tests of mental power and concentration. She also monitors her temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and lung capacity. For the first three months, she was grouchy, but she has become more cheerful in the past month, researchers said.

 Americans would accept an array of encroachments on their lives to help clean up the environment, such as a ban on aerosol cans and mandatory household recycling, a poll has found.

Three-quarters of the respondents said laws against pollution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are too weak, and majorities favored urgent government action, no matter what the cost, to protect the nation's drinking water Large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at all major oil facilities and at oil - and coal-burning power plants, even if those measures would raise the price of oil, gasoline and electricity

 <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> is like a wedding, and each spring this historic city revels in a two-week honeymoon with the performing arts. Like any good wedding, this year's 13th edition of <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> boasts something old, something new, something borrowed and, if not blues, at least plenty of hot jazz. `` The mix of the festival is provocative without being one-sided from an aesthetic point of view,'' says festival general manager <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Redden </PERSON>. `` But if we are n't provocative, if we are n't challenging every year, the festival will lose its audience. The <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> curtain rises Friday, May 26, at noon with a round of speeches on the steps of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. Sixteen days and 111 performances later, <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> closes with a thundering fireworks display over <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION>. This season, the old includes productions of <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>'s opera, `` La Straniera,'' and sold-out performances of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s popular `` The Marriage of <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>,'' the latter directed by festival founder and artistic director <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON>. Among the new productions is <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s music theater work entitled `` Empty Places,'' in which 10,000 images will be juxtaposed to music on more than a dozen moveable screens at the <ORGANIZATION> Gaillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>. The something borrowed is a return engagement of the popular Colla Family Marionettes from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> who performed at the festival years ago. The hand-carved puppets, similar to those <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> enjoyed as a child, return in two new performances. The jazz lineup includes, among other performers, The <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quartet </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> Trio. With ticket sales running 30 percent ahead of last season _ tickets for `` The Marriage of Figaro'' sold out two days after the box office opened in March _ <PERSON> Redden </PERSON> predicts another box-office record for <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>. `` I hope it reflects on the festival generally,'' he said. `` Certainly, I think people are learning to trust what we do. `` We do have a very eclectic offering. At the same time we're doing an 18th-century and a 19th-century opera, we're also doing an absolutely brand-new 20th-century opera with <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. With several major productions scheduled to go on the boards at <LOCATION> Gaillard </LOCATION>, a structural engineer was brought in to make sure the grid above the stage could support the weight of the numerous heavy sets. While there was no problem with the stage, problems were found with the traditional release of helium-filled balloons during the festival's opening ceremonies. The multicolored balloons will not float skyward this year because of concerns sea turtles mistake deflated balloons for jelly fish and try to eat them. Instead, <PERSON> Redden </PERSON> said the festival is working on a way to drop oxygen-filled balloons onto the crowd from above. Other highlights of the festival include: _ Academy award-winning actress <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckart </PERSON> and Tony-winner <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> in the Lee Blessing play, `` Eleemosynary,'' the story of three generations of women and their attempts to communicate with one another. _ `` Dangerous Games,'' a dance theater production with music by <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazzolla </PERSON> and choreography by <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>. _ Dance performances by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Trisha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Other dance offerings include performances by a company known as <ORGANIZATION> ISO </ORGANIZATION> which combines dance, acrobatics and new vaudeville. _ The festival's popular chamber music series _ some featuring musicians who will perform on the festival's new $ 65,000 Steinway piano _ as well as a performance of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Requiem'' and a concert of French music entitled, `` After the Fall of the Bastille.''

<HEAD>East German and Polish Dispute Still Frays `Frontier of Friendship'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SWINOUJSCIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German claims to channel waters off this lucrative Polish port have frayed the `` frontier of friendship'' that separates the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc neighbors. Officials on both sides say a solution is near, but the two countries still carefully stake out their turf on the wide beach west of the port and border guards in towers atop the dunes keep watch over a rusty barbed-wire fence; signs warn strollers. But even marking buoys have not prevented a fierce squabble over sovereignty of the channel, which winds back and forth from the high seas to the port in order to avoid sandbars and shallows. The port of <LOCATION> Swinoujscie </LOCATION> straddles the narrow opening to a bay that leads to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest port, <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, 40 miles to the south on the Odra -LRB- Oder in German -RRB- <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The conflict erupted in 1985 after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> extended its territorial waters by 12 miles and started to enforce its claim to parts of the channel approach to <LOCATION> Swinoujscie </LOCATION> that had been under Polish administration. Negotiations have been going at least since October 1987. While both sides say an agreement is near, concerns over the issue still run strong on the Polish side. East German coast guard cutters have closed in on ships that allegedly strayed out of Polish waters, warning them over bullhorns they were violating East German territory, said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabowski </PERSON>, a department director at the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were facing the problem that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said we were operating on waters they claim do n't belong to us, so the issue must be settled. It was a show -LRB- of authority -RRB- from their side to the ships,'' he said. But he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the past year. The dispute arose at about the time <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> made public plans to open a duty-free zone in <LOCATION> Swinoujscie-Szczecin </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was investing heavily to build up its <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port at <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION> 80 miles to the west. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebnicki </PERSON> of the Maritime Office that handles shipping complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected, and <PERSON> Boleslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolowicz </PERSON>, chairman of the Certa fish cooperative, said it was a problem for deep-sea fishing companies. Talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last June when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> met <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, in the former German city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. A government spokesman at that time said an agreement was near. Ten months later the problem lingers, though in April the East German and Polish foreign ministers said a bilateral agreement will soon be signed that satisfies both sides. `` We here in the Western territories of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are especially sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Timen </PERSON>, an editor at the Szczecin-based weekly newspaper <PERSON> Morze </PERSON> i Ziemia -LRB- Sea and Earth -RRB-. <PERSON> Timen </PERSON>, who has written extensively on the dispute, said Polish authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the conflict in a national and international context. `` Everyone was talking about it, but articles did n't appear _ although you could sneak certain problems into professional or factory publications,'' he said. But Polish underground newspapers from the area reported extensively on the dispute and said that Polish vessels at one point were being stopped and inspected by East Germans. Just after World War II, the area around Swinoujscie-Szczecin, previously German, was turned over to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The German towns of <LOCATION> Swinemuende </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> became Swinoujscie and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Resident Germans were forced to leave, while Polish refugees were moved in after having been expelled by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from what before the war had been the eastern part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. As relations between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> improved in the 1970s, Poles and East Germans only had to show national identity cards to cross the border. Poles flocked to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to shop at its better stocked stores. But after the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in 1980-81, East Germans required Poles to use passports and issued Poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation. Now the majority of Germans in the restaurants and on the beaches are tourists from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, only a two-hour drive away, who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them, among other things, to eat a first-rate dinner for the equivalent of only about $ 10.

 Producer-director-writer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who's gone a few rounds with entertainment's movers and shakers, smiled at the opportunity presented to him in his new CBS series about <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, `` The Famous Teddy Z. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s last show, the critically acclaimed `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' was summarily dumped by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. He does n't use the word revenge, but he says he does expect to take a few shots in his new series, premiering in the fall. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryer </PERSON> -LRB- `` Pretty in Pink'' -RRB- stars as a mail-room clerk at a big talent agency who suddenly finds himself representing the agency's biggest star. `` It's a Cinderella story,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` A kid gets an enormously lucky break, and we show how he deals with it. His naivete and inborn honesty seem to work for him in a business where there's no naivete and little inborn honesty. `` It's a fun little way for me to get even with some people the public thinks are wonderful and that we know are monsters.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was the creator of `` WKRP in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>,'' which ran on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1978-82, the short-lived `` Easy Street'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986-87, and the `` Police Academy'' movie series. He also wrote and directed `` Rustler's Rhapsody,'' a send-up of singing cowboy movies, and `` Burglar.'' `` After ` Burglar,' I realized I could do better work with a freer hand in television and that I would n't be pigeon-holed as I was in films,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` You have more people telling you what to do in films than you do in television. I'd like to do more movies, but what I'd like to do are terrific movies.'' `` Frank's Place,'' which made its debut in September 1987, was one of the most critically acclaimed series of that season. But that was the year of the `` dramedy,'' a hybrid between comedy and drama, and neither CBS nor the audience knew what to do with it. The sophisticated show was given an 8 o'clock -LRB- Eastern -RRB- time period when it should have been on no earlier than 9, then it was bounced around the schedule and taken off the air with the promise of a return. It never did. Other `` dramedies'' got similar treatment. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> sporadically aired `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' then dropped it, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> canceled `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s newest offering has gotten a better time slot _ 9:30 on Monday, sandwiched between the successful `` Murphy Brown'' and `` Designing Women.'' `` I could n't believe it when they put ` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place' in at 8 o'clock,'' he said. `` They also put ` WKRP' in at 8 and the only time it was a big hit was when they moved it to 9 o'clock. It's now a huge success in syndication, which proves my theory that people like the show, but that it was in the wrong time slot.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s new show is loosely based on a real incident that occurred about 30 years ago. A mailroom clerk was sent to pick up the agency's newest star and when he returned, the actor insisted he be made his agent. The erstwhile clerk soon represented the biggest names in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said `` The Famous Teddy Z'' is a fish-out-of-water story. `` He's a guy who has no idea what he is doing,'' he said. `` He lives in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, and his mother think's he must be dealing dope to make so much money. She's very suspicious of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The show is a send-up of celebrities.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> began in the advertising business in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, then came to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to go into films. `` In 1971, I raised $ 40,000 and tried to make a low-budget feature,'' he said. `` I wrote it, acted in it and never finished it so nobody knows how bad it was. `` I came out here and through two friends, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON>, met Grant Tinker. He agreed to take me on as a director trainee, but I saw that in the comedy series, the most important person was the head writer. The first thing I wrote was a ` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> Show.''' Tinker was then head of <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> were producing `` The <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> Show.'' <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> most recently produced `` Molly Dodd'' and `` Slap Maxwell.'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> created `` ALF.''

<DATELINE>COLCA CANYON, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From a condor's perch on this gorge in southern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> you could look down on 10 of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s World Trade Center towers stacked end on end. The 60-mile-long Colca Canyon formed by the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the deepest land gorge on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. This mysterious land of desert-dry moonscapes, exotic vegetation, active volcanoes and scattered pre-Columbian ruins is just now emerging from obscurity. The canyon and surrounding <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> are home to thousands of Indians, descendants of pre-Inca tribesmen who settled here 3,000 years ago. `` The whole history of Peruvian man is summarized in this startling landscape, which until only a few years ago was incommunicado with the rest of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>,'' wrote the Peruvian novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> in the foreword to the recently published `` Discovering The <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' one of the few books on the region. Terraced fields painstakingly carved from the slopes still yield corn and potatoes, the Indians' traditional staples. Ancient irrigation canals keep the land productive. Some farms and hamlets rest precariously on canyon ledges, giving the appearance of defying gravity or tempting fate. Most Indians still build their homes from adobe or rocks and rely on the wool of their alpaca herds for clothing. They share these cloud-swept highlands with Andean condors and scores of rare flora and fauna, such as giant cactuses and the guanaco, an elusive cousin of the llama. From surrounding mountain ridges, the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> plummets 14,339 feet to the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>. The World Trade Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is 1,350 feet high. The opposing lower wall descends 10,607 feet, nearly double the depth of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Grand Canyon. Spanish conquistadors reached the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> in the mid-1500s. They built churches and towns atop Indian villages, and then left, said <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Romana </PERSON>, one of the authors of `` Discovering The <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.'' Americans <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shippee </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> led an expedition into <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> and published an article in the January, 1934, issue of National Geographic, calling it `` a lost valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>.'' It was a brief interlude in the obscurity of the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION>, whose wonders stayed forgotten until a gravel road was forged in the mid-1970s, linking it with <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>, 115 miles south. <ORGANIZATION> Arequipa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s second largest city, is 545 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. `` To the surprise of Peruvians and foreigners alike, this important setting, full of history and culture, appeared to the world,'' <PERSON> Romana </PERSON> said in an interview. The road brought change to the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' traditional self-sufficient lifestyle, tourists and spreading fame. The Guinness book recorded the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION>'s depth for the first time in the mid-1980s, <PERSON> Romana </PERSON> said. The road now carries travelers on a rugged five-hour journey in the shadow of the Andes' majestic spine, across the barren and cold altiplano and skirting volcanic cones. The canyon rim offers a bird's eye view of walls plunging thousands of feet to the rushing <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and of condors gliding on thermal winds over farms and villages. The most dramatic places are several days farther by foot and mule and are seen by just a hearty handful of the 10,000 to 15,000 tourists who reach the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> yearly, according to <LOCATION> Romana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arequipa </ORGANIZATION> guide, said some visitors are discouraged because they can not easily reach the deepest zone. The arduous journey by road, a shortage of lodgings and generally unsafe conditions signal some of the major problems facing Peruvian tourism. In the last several years <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has been hit by spreading social and economic chaos, fueled by its worst recession of the century. Tourism officials say the country does not have the money to invest substantially in tourism infrastructure or even protect what already exists. But officials say the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> so far seems to have been spared from a recent upsurge in highway banditry and the bloody guerrilla insurgency plaguing many other areas of the country. <PERSON> Romana </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Colca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to preserve the zone, said the arrival of the modern world has not yet had a serious impact on the <LOCATION> Colca </LOCATION> or its people.

<HEAD>Missiles Going, Troops Staying?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It seems only logical, just plain common sense: when diplomats strike a deal to eliminate some weapons, the soldiers who have been manning them wo n't have to do so any more. So, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under an arms control treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the American troops assigned to the missile units ought to be coming home. Right, said Rep. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Wrong, said the Pentagon. When <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> advanced his proposition the other day, he said he was left feeling like the skunk at the garden party. It turned out the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was n't planning on pulling any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> just because of the missile treaty. The missile personnel would just stay put and get new assignments. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a Republican who prides himself on a hawkish record on defense legislation, said the military is playing `` kind of a shell game.'' When he first raised the manpower question, he was told about 25,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are on assignments that will be eliminated by the INF treaty. This meant the assignments would go, not the manpower. After the congressman said he had in mind recalling them from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, there was some delay followed by a new, reduced <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> estimate of the number involved _ more like 5,000. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said the real count probably is about 16,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel on European assignments that will be obsolete under the INF treaty. In any event, he was told, most of them were supposed to be doing something else anyhow. They had been diverted from other assignments to missile duty, all because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was so stingy with manpower. Now they can get back to whatever it was the services wanted them doing in the first place. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may decide otherwise. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., are sponsoring a legislation to have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel assigned to the intermediate-range missile units pulled returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when the weapons are eliminated That would n't make a big dent in the 325,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops still stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said it would at least send a message to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that they have to pay a bigger share of defense costs. `` We've got to leave the check on the table one time and let the Europeans pick it up,'' he said. But the armed services do n't want cuts. A defense official told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing last Thursday that the military is at work on `` a variety of proposed missions'' for the missile bases the treaty renders obsolete. `` We have made significant progress in the identification of new missions,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for international security policy. No specifics, he said. That's classified. Those overseas bases have remarkable staying power, since they are mission-shopping while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally has swallowed some politically unpopular cuts in domestic military bases. <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON> said there were 14,562 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> slots in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on intermediate-range missile assignments that will be eliminated by the fall of 1990. But he said only 5,685 of them are going to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the rest will be reassigned `` to requirements that could not be accomplished earlier ... and to needed enhancement of our European defense posture.'' To deal with congressional insistence that the INF missile cuts be accompanied by real cuts in personnel and costs, the current plan is to have about 8,000 slots cut in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instead of in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Those manpower reductions would show up in the rosters of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said estimates of defense savings made possible by the INF treaty range as high as $ 2 billion, but he said they'll never be realized if the personnel involved `` are squirreled away in other European posts. But the starting point assumption seems to be that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops will stay in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in about their current number, for the foreseeable future. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> says it's become a sort of entitlement program, like the domestic social programs in which the law says who'll get benefits, automatically and usually permanently. The question of sharing that defense burden is among the issues waiting for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he journeys to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> next week for the 40th anniversary <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting.

<HEAD>A New But Still Unknown Peronist to Take Argentina's Helm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON> says he believes in President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the newest heir to <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. `` He has the same thoughts as <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON> said. `` He understands the feelings and the pain of the people.'' <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON>, a 39-year-old former custodian who uses a wheelchair, is one of the 7.9 million Argentines who voted for <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the presidential election May 14 and said he is convinced that if <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is made aware of a problem, he will fix it. <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON> wants the government to refurbish a hospital that <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> opened 40 years ago but later fell into disrepair and now is closed. But <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the 58-year-old governor of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rioja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, is a new and still largely unknown face of Peronism. <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON> may have to wait for the hospital. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> still is tied to organized labor that has been the backbone of the party for 40 years but insists `` at no point did we make promises'' to anyone, except to provide `` work, work and more work.'' The new <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> will have a severe economic problem to deal with when he takes office Dec. 10 _ one of keeping the country from sliding into economic and social chaos and the policies of the old Peronism are not apt to work to that end in today's <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Argentines who did n't vote for <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> accepted his victory with resignation. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> used to say it could solve everything in two or three months,'' said <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, a lawyer. `` <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is saying it's going to take two or three years. It's good he says that because it's going to take at least that long.'' The first real insights into how <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s Peronists will government are not likely until he names his Cabinet in June and when he presents his own economic program and takes responsibility for it. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s $ 59-billion foreign debt, on which $ 3.5 billion in interest is overdue, will be a chief concern. Peronist economists selected by <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> have been assigned to a delegation of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s incumbent government for meetings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s creditors. Peronists also have become involved in government actions aimed at stabilizing the deteriorating economy, which poses perhaps the biggest threat to a smooth political transition in December. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> stresses his party is merely cooperating with <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, not co-governing. But the political risk is much the same. Politics in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for four decades has been polarized by love for or hatred of the party founded by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1946. Workers and the poor, who receive essential benefits and protections, are unswervingly loyal. `` The great contribution of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> is the incorporation of workers into the national political life,'' said <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Luder </PERSON>, a constitutional attorney and the party's 1983 presidential candidate. The middle class and the political right see it as fascist, authoritarian, corporative, corrupt, incompetent, dominated by the unions and unable to control the host of movements that gather under its banner. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has worked to dispel what he calls his party's `` black legend.'' Peronists were the victims of violence as much as anyone else, he says, reminding Argentines that the party had been banned or restricted for 25 of the past 34 years and that he was jailed for nearly five years following the military coup that ousted <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s widow, Isabel, from the presidency in March 1976 She had been her husband's vice president and succeeded him on his death in 1974. `` Peronist violence was a response to violence exercised against Peronism,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has said. `` I'm not justifying one or the other, but let's be a little more evenhanded.'' But skepticism of Peronism remains among Argentines who remember churches that were burned, newspapers that were taken over, dissidents who were harassed and industries that were nationalized by <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrielli </PERSON>, 24, a business broker, said his father took to wearing a gun in 1940s because he was n't a Peronist and felt threatened. <PERSON> Mirta </PERSON> <PERSON> Candolfi </PERSON>, 40, an employee of the state telephone company, recalls Peronists coming into her grammar school and taking down the picture of Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the father of the country, and replacing it with <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s. `` The fear of Peronism was n't invented. It stems from peoples' memories of things that happened,'' said <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, the lawyer But even critics say <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> seems to accept ideas that the party once rejected, such as selling off state-owned companies. He acts on the basis of explanation and compromise, and he actively seeks _ and receives _ public support. `` <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has an extreme ability to reach out and put his arm around his enemies,'' a diplomat said. `` He draws people in rather than pushes people away. That's his strategy. We have to wait and see what the policies will be.''

 This quiet, bone-dry ravine of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery. And with the mystery, its name. Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty. To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the Valley of the Queens. `` It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by all Egyptologists,'' said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>, field director for a continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its history. `` We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and named by tradition rather than history.'' Season after archaeological season, <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON>'s team has scoured the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000 years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> era when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses painted on. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said the first burials were princes and princesses of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died like kings. That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the 19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said it's unclear why he did or why the practice continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers. Paintings in some of the tombs show <PERSON> Hathor </PERSON>, the goddess of women and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients here, because <PERSON> Hathor </PERSON>'s realm also included the cemeteries on what is called the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> across the Nile from present-day <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>. The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began, was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs in the Valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. Many of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s greatest rulers were buried there, along with the young <PERSON> pharoah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>, whose treasure-filled tomb was discovered by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1922. That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, the Valley of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles. For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit to the Valley of the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION>. When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known. `` We could n't understand the cemetery before, because we were working tomb-by-tomb,'' <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said. `` Today, we've uncovered all the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would have looked when burials began. `` For the first time, we can write its history.'' As <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> talked, he and <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanein </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Documentation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's bedrock The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its existence. An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now. The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers of Ramses II's powerful queen <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>, is among those so deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been destroyed by natural forces. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said one source for the valley's history has been tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but with mysteries. Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen <ORGANIZATION> Isis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nefret </ORGANIZATION>, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named Duat-Iny-Pet. <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> said they might have been same person, but `` where are they?'' He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of the queens' mummies. `` This is strange,'' he said. `` Did those who came afterwards destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children. Typical of the tales <PERSON> LeBlanc </PERSON> has faced in rewriting a new history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the tomb of 9-year-old prince <PERSON> Amon-Hir-Khopshef </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Local guides tell fascinated visitors that <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' queen became so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed. The story is nonsense, <PERSON> Leblanc </PERSON> said. Early this century, the Italian excavator <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiaparelli </PERSON> found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens. It was <PERSON> Schiaparelli </PERSON>, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the prince's empty sarcophagus. Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction that it has its own tiny case.

 On April 6, 1988, Grammy-winning guitarist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> walked out of his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> recording studio and into a gunman's bullet. He believed he was going to die. `` I hit the floor, and then I prayed. ... I was ready to go to heaven,'' said <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, a born-again <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. `` And I'll bet you that bought me some time. I think that kind of faith was a real positive thing.'' <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>'s faith _ and the frantic efforts of doctors who repaired his severed carotid artery _ saved his life. Since then, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> has made an incredible recovery and returned with a new album, `` On Solid Ground,'' and an upcoming world tour. But music is not <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>'s only business these days. He's also established a fund to aid crime victims who need help and have nowhere to turn. None of it seemed possible when he was gunned down by an unknown assailant for unknown reasons in the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> 13 months ago. The bullet severed a vocal cord and caused damage to his left arm. `` The doctors told my wife, ` He'll be fine _ if he lives. He'll play,''' <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> recalled in a voice still raspy from the shooting `` I could n't see it ... In the back of my mind. I wondered if I was ever going to be as good as before.'' After seven months of rigorous therapy and medical attention, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> picked up the guitar for the first time to see for himself if the licks featured on albums by <PERSON> Steely </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> were still within him. The answer came one night in his studio, when <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> settled in to record an instrumental version of the <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> and the Dominoes classic `` Layla'' for his new album. `` That part that's on the record is one complete take all the way through. And there's that one lick in the middle of it that's just FLYING,'' said <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, his voice rising with excitement `` I was real proud, and I felt great. So that was kind of a spark, that night I did ` Layla.' It was like, ` It's back, it's back.' Confident that he could handle the guitar, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> turned his attention to Helping Innocent People -LRB- HIP -RRB-, a support group he founded to aid crime victims in need of financial or other help. `` We watch the news and we read the papers, and there's victims every day,'' <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> said. `` Most of us are jaded to it _ I was. I'd be eating my dinner and watching TV, and go on with my life.'' HIP has already started to help, recently providing $ 100 to a crime victim left hospitalized by a vicious gang beating, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> said. `` That's our dream _ to help people just when they need it,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> will contribute part of the proceeds of the world tour which begins June 31 in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, toward the fund. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> established his credentials as a premier guitarist during the 1970s. He played on 13 albums with the Crusaders, worked on three <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> albums and contributed guitar work on Steely Dan classics such as `` Kid Charlemagne'' and `` <PERSON> Josie </PERSON>.'' His fretwork was featured in more than 3,000 sessions, including appearances with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and Barbra Streisand. Along the way there were two Grammy Awards and another five Grammy nominations. But in the early part of this decade, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> put out the word he was through with session work. `` I just started realizing that I was n't looking forward to going to work in the morning. And when I realized I was n't looking forward to making my sessions, rather than continue doing them and take the money, I quit.'' Since them, <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>'s solo career has progressed steadily, peaking in 1987 with his acclaimed `` Last Nite'' album and its single, `` Minute by Minute.'' The shooting interrupted work on a follow-up album, and instantly changed his priorities. `` I'm one of the fortunate ones,'' said <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>. `` I'm going to live, and I'm going to continue to make a living and make my music. Helping Innocent People was born because we realize that. It was born out of that philosophy, to help the less fortunate out.''

 In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, three years ago the final eight games of the season were canceled after a father threatened umpire <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> with a knife. In Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a manager clubbed a rival manager with a bat and sent him to the hospital before the game even started. State Police had to be called to break up a brawl at the 1972 Little League World Series. Little League has had its share of critics over the years, but its very prosperity indicates to supporters that its benefits clearly outweigh its flaws. Most parents who have sat on wooden benches on a lazy summer afternoon and watched their own and their neighbors' kids enjoy the national pastime, however ineptly, conclude that Little League ca n't be all bad. This is especially true when a man sees his son let a ball go right by him in the outfield because he was preoccupied at the time blowing dandelion fuzz. In another game, the same father watched the same son get struck out four times by a towheaded pitcher with a fast ball you couldnt believe. His son apparently harbored no ill will toward the pitcher, however, because 10 years later he took her to the senior prom. The Little League, after a lawsuit, began allowing girls to play in 1974. One of Little League's least vocal but most severe critics is, sadly, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> himself. `` I have absolutely no animosity toward anyone working for the corporation,'' he says. `` Many of them are my dearest friends But what Little League is now is not what I envisioned it to be and I do not approve.'' <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> feels that commercialization has blurred the neighborhood focus of the program which he saw as its heart and its purpose. He feels this is most evident in the annual World Series. <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> arranged the first one, in 1947, as a rather modest `` tournament'' among all-star teams from three states to draw attention to his idea in the early postwar years. He did not foresee its becoming an international event, ballyhooed, televised and broadcast play by play to places as far away as <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. He felt, he explains, that a county championship or state would be sufficient aspiration for youngsters, `` a tournament close to home and inexpensive, financed the same way the leagues are financed, by local sponsors.'' He says he watched neighborhood volunteers replaced on his board of directors with celebrities and benefactors through the influence of national sponsors. His critics say he was behind the times, a naive innocent who did n't realize Little League's potential. His supporters say, as did one <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> father, `` All my kid wants to do is play in the World Series. All I want him to do is play baseball and have fun.'' Because of these and other philosophical and administrative differences <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> was eased out of the Little League in 1955. Without bitterness, he says, `` I decided it was time to surrender.'' He once described what he had given birth to as a Frankenstein's monster. So he left. He took with him, however, his Original Little League. It is not affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Original Little League has thrived in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> in the 34 years since <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s ouster. About 150 children, including about 25 girls, play on 12 teams in three age groups. `` I think our program is a lot better than theirs,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who played in and now directs the Original Little League. `` We do n't stress winning as much as they. We seem to have a more relaxed atmosphere at our games. If adults get overly boisterous we just tell them politely that this is for the kids. `` We play every night, Monday through Friday, and at the end of the season we play some all-star games with neighboring leagues. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> often comes down to watch the games. The kids love him, ask for his autograph. They still call him Uncle Tuck.'' The field the `` Originals'' play on is the same one <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> used to rearrange newspapers and figure out the proper distance between bases for kids. The field has been improved over the years by volunteers. It has a fence and scoreboard and dugouts and clubhouse and grandstands. On May 4, 1974 the city of <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> formally dedicated that field on Memorial Park to its honored citizen and put up a sign: The <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> Field. So Uncle Tuck still has that. Another honor came to <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> on Oct. 8, 1988. The Original Little League threw a testimonial dinner to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Last year. `` Our first season was in 1939,'' says <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, his penchant for accuracy unremitting. `` So we celebrated our 10th anniversary at the end of the 1948 season, not 1949. Count it up. Use your fingers. `` In 1948 I put out a 25-page 6-by-9 booklet with pictures of all the boys. It brought in, let's see here, $ 200.59 in contributions in excess of printing costs. This year's 50th anniversary of their <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> is a year late.'' In <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s back yard is a garage-size building which he built himself to preserve what he calls `` my display.'' If you drop by, he will show you the first Little League bat. You will see snapshots of the first three Little League teams, no different in composition than today's Polaroids that decorate refrigerators across the land. You will see handwritten batting records, done in pencil instead of ballpoint. You will see an original base. It was made of white canvas stitched together and stuffed with wood shavings by <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Laurabelle </PERSON>, the mother of his two nephews who wondered who they would play. That mother was the first of 750,000 yearly volunteers who make it all work. You will see the first Little League home plate, which <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> cut out of a piece of half-inch rubber he found in his father's basement _ and, of all things, the pocketknife he used to cut it, which, it appears, he could n't bear to throw away `` I had in mind a traveling display,'' <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> says, `` something to take around the country so Little League kids could take a look at their roots.'' Speaking of roots, you will also find in <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s display the brittle remains of the lilac bush that tripped him up in his back yard and set him to dream of a better way, a dream that became Little League. `` That lilac stump? Well,'' says <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, `` after a couple of years I went and looked and discovered it was still there. So I dug it up. `` Yeah, I guess that's one thing I saved on purpose.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ The opening of the <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> 100 years ago this month, and the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical school four years later, greatly influenced the way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trains its doctors.

 The Chief swept into the hospital lobby, handing his hat, coat and books to the waiting crowd, dispensing a cheery greeting and a wave of his hand. He led them past the outstretched arms of the 10-foot marble Christ and down the long corridor to the first ward. Gathering at a bed, spectators focused their attention on the patient. And on The Chief. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Osler </PERSON>, a showman with high forehead and the bold mustache of a pirate, was in his element. He was teaching medical students at the bedside. And he was making history. For this was <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> around the turn of the century. And <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> was among a small group of physicians who were helping change the way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trained its doctors. With the opening of the hospital in 1889 and the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical school in 1893, <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> and his colleagues became the first American medical faculty to demand a college degree from incoming students. They also put a new emphasis on research and on learning by experience. `` From the outset, <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> embodied a conception of medical education as a field of graduate study, rooted in basic science and hospital medicine, that was eventually to govern all institutions in the country,'' wrote sociologist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, `` The Social Transformation of American Medicine.'' As <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> graduates became professors and scientists all over the country and abroad, `` they took a major part in shaping the character of medical education and research in the 20th century,'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> wrote. This month marks 100 years of medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> planned to issue a $ 1 <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> stamp, and the prestigious Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> dedicated its June 2 issue to new research from <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. The Hopkins influence on medicine extends beyond medical education. In the past century, researchers there developed the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, built the first renal dialysis apparatus, crystallized insulin and made many other key contributions. The Hopkins medical school opened its doors at a time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had some good medical schools, but also many poor ones, medical historian <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in a recent interview. No national standards yet governed medical education. Just about anybody could get into a medical school somewhere, often without even a high school education. Some diploma mills conferred a degree in less than a year. Schools had to compete for access to hospitals and clinics where students could get some training with patients. Most schools could not offer much bedside experience. In general, American medical schools also lacked laboratory facilities and conducted only limited original research. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, by contrast, was leading a scientific transformation of medicine that began in the mid-19th century, fueled by advances in microscopy, chemistry and physiology. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reformers had been pressing for tougher academic standards, noted <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> medical historian <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The reformers argued that medical students needed a much better background to study medicine effectively at a time of many advances in such areas as surgery, pathology, bacteriology and biology. But some medical school professors opposed raising entrance standards. It might discourage a natural genius in the art of healing, they said. And a school that raised its requirements risked losing students to less-rigorous institutions _ no small consideration at a time when medical schools depended largely on student fees. Some of the better schools made major academic improvements during the 1870s and 1880s. And in 1874, one key reformer told the trustees in charge of establishing <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> hospital and university that they had a `` precious'' chance to set up a top-notch school of their own. `` No medical school already organized has anything like your opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Hopkins trustees had some major advantages. Rather than battling entrenched dogma and professors they could start from scratch. And rather than having to persuade a hospital to let students into wards, they could make the hospital a teaching tool from the beginning. When it came to opening the medical school, however, they also had a big problem. As trustees of the estate of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, they were in charge of what was then the largest endowment in American history. The $ 7 million <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> left upon his death in 1873 was to be used for establishing the hospital and a university. But even as the hospital opened its doors in 1889, the financial prospects for opening the medical school were shaky. Income from the railroad stock that made up the university endowment had dried up. Four wealthy, well-educated daughters of the trustees offered to raise the needed money, provided the school would admit women on equal terms as men. The trustees agreed. But by December 1892, the women had raised less than half the $ 500,000 the school needed. Other medical schools, knowing of the delay, were trying to lure the Hopkins medical faculty away. Finally, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, a member of the women's committee, offered to donate the balance _ for a price. The school would have to admit only students who had a bachelor's degree, and a reading knowledge of French and German. The trustees, swallowing hard at requirements they feared might drive away many prospective students, accepted. `` It is lucky that we got in as professors,'' <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> told a fellow faculty member. `` We could never enter as students.'' It was a relief when 18 students, including three women, showed up to form the first class.

 The medical curriculum <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> provided was marked not so much by innovation, as by combination of features that had appeared in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and scattered American schools. It started with `` a clean slate and a bunch of good ideas and good examples,'' said medical historian King. Of all the American schools that were trying to improve medical education, `` <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> went about it with the greatest enthusiasm and effectiveness.'' It was an ambitious enterprise, even apart from requiring a college degree for entry. Few other schools provided well-equipped laboratories in basic science for teachers and students. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> aimed to stress medical research rather than just the passing on of existing knowledge. The idea was `` to give the world men who can not only sail by the old charts, but who can make new and better ones for the use of others,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON>, a Civil War battlefield surgeon who became a key architect of the medical school curriculum. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> also made a policy of learning by doing, both in the laboratory and in the hospital. With <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> as their mentor at the bedside, students took medical histories of patients, performed physical examinations, conducted routine laboratory tests and followed their patients' course. As <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> put it, `` the student began with the patient, continued with the patient, ended his studies with the patient, using books and lectures as tools, means to an end.'' The school made full-time jobs out of teaching basic science, rather than using local physicians to teach part time, as most other schools did. The full-time idea, later extended to instructors of medical practice, allowed <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> to go outside the local community to lure top-notch faculty members. Eventually, the school also offered lengthy training in medical specialties to its students who had finished the four years of the regular curriculum. The result of all this was such that in 1901, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> congratulated <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> on a `` prodigious advancement of medical teaching.'' Among all the changes in the nation of the previous 25 years, <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> continued, `` there is none greater than that wrought in the development of medical teaching and research, and these men whom you, sir, summoned here have led the way.'' Who were those men? Most attention nowadays goes to the Big Four. One was <PERSON> Osler </PERSON>, who had come from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to become professor of medicine at the school and physician-in-chief at the hospital. The author of a classic medical text, <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> became one of the nation's most highly regarded physicians. Joining him was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON>, a shy and excrutiatingly meticulous surgeon. He became well-known for such innovations as the radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and his training of other surgeons. Then there was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, a genial, rotund pathology professor who became a power behind reforms in medical education and stimulated interest in medical philanthropy. Finally there was <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the gynecological surgeon, who developed and improved that art. He `` took pleasure in quick, flashy operating,'' one student wrote later. `` He'd be in and out of the abdomen almost before you knew it, all the time talking and illustrating what he was doing or about to do.'' Today, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s operating table serves as a library table, its thick glass top chipped around the edges. Of the 17 original hospital buildings, only three remain, hemmed in by the modern boxy homes of the modern hospital and medical school. The old sitting room where <PERSON> Osler </PERSON> wrote his famous textbook is now split into cubicles by blue room dividers, part of an administrative office. The scene today at <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> would astonish the Big Four. Faint rock music nudges the quiet of a white-walled laboratory as <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON>, 39, holds up a dark gray sheet of X-ray film. It shows several series of smudged black lines. During the days of the Big Four, physicians were just beginning to understand cancer as a disease of abnormal cells. Now, the smudged lines on <PERSON> Vogelstein </PERSON>'s film are helping to explain those abnormalities. They represent an analysis of colon cancer tissue, suggesting that the tumors arose after normal cells lost protection from a gene that suppresses cancer. In a room crammed with computer display terminals, <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, 36, narrates a series of ghostly images. A skull tumbles end over end, revealing its inner detail. A hip bone sways in its pelvic socket like a pendulum. A dark blue liver rotates to reveal patches of cancer that look like popcorn. <PERSON> Halsted </PERSON> needed a scalpel to peer within patients like this; radiologist <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON> uses sophisticated scanning machines and computer power. The result is three-dimensional images of the body's interior that can be rotated or manipulated, helping surgeons plan operations well in advance. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON>, 67, arose shortly after 5 a.m. one recent day at his <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> home. He drank some coffee, read the paper, picked up a medical journal article and began to dictate into a small tape recorder. It was time to catalog a new human gene. When the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical school was founded, the idea of genes was not yet generally accepted, for the work of Austrian monk <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON> in the 1860s was not yet widely known. Today, <PERSON> McKusick </PERSON> maintains a list of human genes, accessible by computer around the world. The entry he dictated before breakfast that morning was number 4,584. But while medicine has advanced greatly since <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> began, some things stay the same, notes <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical historian <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGehee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. A committee that reviewed the <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> medical curriculum recently endorsed the ideas of learning by doing, and of not only teaching medicine but also emphasizing the importance of creating new knowledge, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` It's a process of rediscovery,'' he said with a smile. `` They rediscovered all the principles that were here when the place started.''

And while other parochial schools struggle with rising tuitions and dwindling enrollments, <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> has managed to afford $ 5 million in improvements in recent years, thanks to the generosity of donors, largely alumni.

 The unusual story behind the founding of <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is captured in the Latin words engraved in stone above the columns on its classical facade: `` Deo et Patriae Pietas <PERSON> Christiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Erexit </PERSON>.'' Or, as even the most plodding of Latin scholars who ever trod the corridors of this reknowned Jesuit high school might translate: `` Built by Christian piety for God and country.'' Seventy-five years after a rich widow anonymously gave her pastor $ 500,000 to build a free school for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> boys, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> is still giving full scholarships to every student it admits. It draws the cream of the academic crop, mainly from parochial grammar schools in the five boroughs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the surrounding three-state suburbs and sometimes even farther afield. `` Everyone thinks I'm crazy to come into the city,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzetti </PERSON>, 14, a freshman who spends three hours a day traveling back and forth from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` My friends back home think I live here,'' says <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, 14, a freshman who rises at 5:30 a.m. to commute with his brother, a sophomore, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The journey can take up to two hours each way, but I do n't have any regrets You can do a lot of homework on the train _ or you can just sleep.'' For <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taveras </PERSON>, 17, a senior who chose <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> over the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, the trip to school is a 30-minute subway ride from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. `` I love it here,'' <PERSON> Taveras </PERSON> says. `` When you come from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, it's really challenging to grow up in a different kind of world. This school is a meeting ground for people from so many different backgrounds.'' Today's 501 Regis students are getting their free education _ valued by school officials at over $ 24,000 _ thanks not only to the generosity of the original benefactor and her family who over the years gave millions to keep the school running, but its 7,500 alumni who in recent years have become major benefactors in their own right. About half the $ 3.3 million budget comes from interest on the school's investments. The rest is raised each year from alumni, foundations and other sources. `` Each year the costs go up at least $ 200,000,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, <PERSON> S.J. </PERSON>, the president since 1980. `` That's not going to end.' But while other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools struggle with rising tuitions and contracting enrollments, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> has been able to pour $ 5 million in recent years into expanding science labs and other major renovations of its building on East 84th Street, two blocks from Central Park. The top faculty salaries will hover near $ 40,000 this fall. Last year's seniors scored an average of 1,273 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 369 points above the national average. Many graduates attend select colleges, including 84 who went on to <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> colleges in the past four years alone. More than a third of the students come from families with incomes below $ 30,000 a year, and 40 percent are the children of immigrants from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and three dozen other countries. `` It's still very much an immigrants' school,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hevern </PERSON>, <PERSON> S.J. </PERSON>, the school psychologist. The school, largely white for decades, now has a 28 percent minority enrollment, including 60 Hispanic students -LRB- 12 percent -RRB-, 51 Asian -LRB- 10 percent -RRB- and 28 black -LRB- 6 percent -RRB-. Unlike many parochial schools, especially in big cities, it does not admit non-Catholics. Each fall, on the first Saturday in November, about 900 students take a standardized admissions test. Students also are judged on their elementary school grades, activities and, for the finalists, an interview before the 130 scholarship winners are chosen shortly before Christmas. In 1978 nearly 1,300 students took the entrance test. The number fell to a low of 770 in 1987 before rebounding. Most of those admitted score in the top 5 percent on standardized tests _ a common cutoff for the gifted. Regis officials, casting a worried eye on the dwindling pool, talk openly of the possibility of admitting girls some day, as all Jesuit colleges and some 10 Jesuit high schools already have done.

 `` There's no comparable opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> girls in the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, the headmaster. `` If the demographics ever became really horrendous, that's one way to broaden the pool.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> will be succeeded as headmaster this summer by the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntz </PERSON>, who has been headmaster of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Prep in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuntz </PERSON>, a 1966 <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> graduate, will be only the second alumnus ever to run the school. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> says he does n't think <PERSON> Regis </PERSON>' boys-only status could withstand a legal challenge. `` I think someone would crack that tomorrow and we'd have to take in girls if they got a good lawyer.'' The school's two top administrators are two of only a dozen Jesuits left on the 50-member staff. A quarter-century ago, more than half the faculty were Jesuit priests or `` scholastics'' _ young Jesuits halfway through the 13-year preparation process leading to ordination. Not a few of them were alumni. In fact, a Regis yearbook marking the 50th anniversary in 1964 noted that almost 10 percent of its alumni were priests. But few Regians opt for the priesthood these days. Many of the Jesuits on the faculty are nearing retirement, and their replacements are not in sight. It has only one scholastic this semester `` and we're not sure we'll get a replacement when he leaves,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the assistant headmaster. Other things have changed at the school. There was a time, says <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakinship </PERSON>, chairman of the science department, when a Regis student was just a student. `` Now he's taking care of the younger brothers and sisters, cooking the meals, doing the wash while the mother works. In my advanced placement physics class, two-thirds of the guys had jobs.'' No longer do students flunk out in droves in the sort of educational triage that once characterized many Jesuit schools. Latin, long the backbone of the curriculum, became optional four years ago. While that raised the hackles of some alumni, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> says, `` we're trying to get needy students in here. We're bringing in kids who very often are the first people in their family to complete high school. They know no reason to study Latin.'' While it is no longer producing legions of priests, <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> does inculcate in its students the value of community service. Seniors are required to spend Tuesday mornings out as volunteer tutors in grammar schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods, or working in hospitals or nursing homes. Most seniors are freed from all classes during the last trimester to devote full time to such pursuits, or to work on job internships. Its alumni include several university presidents, including <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> -LRB- 1942 -RRB- of <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> -LRB- 1948 -RRB- of <LOCATION> Fordham </LOCATION>, as well as banking executives, corporate chieftains and judges _ although rival <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> boasts <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. The alumni rolls are also thick with lawyers who first honed their oratorical skills in the classrooms of <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> and its <ORGANIZATION> Hearn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a perennial state debating champion. `` We still produce more lawyers than anything else,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> says. `` If you teach here for a while you understand that it is not an accident. Our kids love to argue.'' But the school's best-known graduate is Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, the AIDS researcher and director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases whom President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called one of his personal heroes. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, a 1958 graduate, remembers fondly his four years commuting as a straphanger from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to the upper <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where he encountered `` an academic excellence that really was unmatched in all of the educational experiences I've had since then.'' <PERSON> Regis </PERSON> is now run by a board that includes both lay and Jesuit members. Its leaders say it will retain that Jesuit character, even as the numbers of priests on its staff dwindle. <PERSON> Mazzetti </PERSON>, the freshman from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, said his parents have been pleasantly surprised at how few demands the school makes for money to pay for extracurriculars or anything else. `` At my old school, they always asked for money for every little thing,'' he says. But an older student who overheard the remark chimed in knowingly, `` Never being asked for money? Give me a break. Wait until you graduate.''

 Outdoorsman and writer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>, a conservationist with a sense of humor, is still spouting the one-liners that have endeared him so long to so many anglers. `` I prefer any kind of fishing to any kind of work,'' the 78-year-old <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> likes to say. And: _ `` Fishermen are born honest, but they get over it.'' _ `` Some wise guy once defined a fishing line as a piece of string with a worm on one end and a damn fool on the other. This is a silly definition, of course, for many fishermen use flies instead of worms.'' _ `` Fish is brain food. People who eat fish have large, well-developed brains. People with large, well-developed brains do n't fish. It's that simple.'' Beneath the mischievous grin, however, is a serious concern about what could lie ahead unless Americans start paying more attention to the world around them. `` Thirty-five years ago, we did n't have waste products of nuclear plants,'' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says. `` We did n't have a lot of the poisons that are poisoning the atmosphere. We did n't know that spray cans could destroy our ozone layer.'' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> never imagined things would become as bad as they have. `` I thought something would be done about it, measures would be taken,'' he says. `` Unfortunately, it did n't work out that way.'' The bearded, hoary-headed author of the `` Exit Laughing'' column in <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stream magazine, occasionally mistaken in the past for another avid outdoorsman, the late <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, is doing what he can to increase public awareness. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> is the author of six volumes of humor and a 1985 anthology entitled `` Hunting and Fishing from A to <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>.'' He also is creator of the more-or-less imaginary Madison Avenue <PERSON> Rod </PERSON>, Gun, <ORGANIZATION> Bloody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labrador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retriever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose motto is `` Keep your powder, your trout flies and your martinis dry.'' `` It's implicit in everything he does, the respect for the outdoors, the love for it,'' says <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stream's managing editor That zeal is perhaps best exemplified in the conservation awards program <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> founded in 1954 with corporate backing. His aim was, and still is, to give conservation-conscious folks `` a slap on the back.'' His Chevron Conservation Awards Program, believed to be the oldest privately supported program of its kind in the country, has recognized 663 individuals and 101 organizations over the years. The 1989 finalists were honored May 17 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C. Each year, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> helps whittle down the list of up to 150 nominees. Some of them, he acknowledges, fit the stereotypical image of the conservationist. `` Little old lady in tennis shoes? They exist and they're charming people, usually,'' he says, chuckling His all-time favorite finalist is a 70-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> game warden who was honored in the late'50s. The man's wife, who nominated her husband for the award, thanked <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> profusely following the ceremony. `` This little old lady came up to me and said, ` Mr. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>, I want to thank you for being involved in this and to tell you what a wonderful thing it was for me,''' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says. `` I said, ` Well, I should think it would be wonderful to have all these people here to honor your husband.' `` She looked sort of surprised. She said, ` Oh, no, it is n't that We've been married 52 years and this is the first time we've ever stayed at a hotel.' <PERSON> Zern </PERSON>'s passion for the outdoors was nurtured by his father, who headed <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> during the 1910s. The elder <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> often took his young son on inspection trips. `` I would see what the mine drainage had done to the stream,'' he recalls. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> caught his first trout at age 5. The next year, his family moved from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. Since then, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> has fished and hunted on five continents. Occasionally, sometimes by accident and sometimes not, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> repeats himself in his `` Exit Laughing'' column, which he began in 1958. It never goes unnoticed. `` I always get three or four letters and I hae the same answer to all of them,'' he says. `` I say, ` Dear Mr. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, Thank you for your letter of such and such a date. The last time I heard the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>, they played the <ORGANIZATION> Brahms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> and I understand they've done it several times before. Sincerely yours.''' So just where does he get his ideas? `` I wish I had one,'' he says. `` I've got a piece due the day after tomorrow. It was a lot easier when I was younger and smart-aleckier than I am now.'' He also suffers now from Parkinson's disease, which causes his hands to tremble and consequently prevents him from shifting from a manual typewriter to an electric typewriter or computer. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> is at his home in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, only about half the time. The rest of the time he's on the road. His favorite sport, and writing topic, is fishing. Like many serious anglers, he tosses his catch back into the water. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> does n't feel the least bit sorry for the uninitiated. `` I'm rather glad everybody does n't like fishing or the good fishing places would be so overpopulated,'' he says. `` So I'd never knowingly write anything that would encourage anybody to go fishing. You can always build more bowling alleys or tennis courts. You ca n't build more trout streams.'' His sentiments are shared by his program's awardees. Among the 11 citizen volunteers honored this year were a <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, couple who have developed a school curriculum on marine and wetlands resources, and a <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> man who has led a campaign to establish a national park in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Ten professional conservationists also received $ 1,000 and a bronze plaque, including a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> biologist from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who is working to save the threatened Piping Plover, a shore bird. The five group finalists included the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which is rehabilitating local waterways so fish can migrate upstream. The 30 to 40 students are raising money for a new hatchery to replace one that failed to meet earthquake standards. <PERSON> Zern </PERSON> says he has no real way of knowing whether the awards program or any of his other efforts have had, or will have, a significant effect. `` We do n't really know how many souls are saved,'' he says, `` no matter how tough the sermon.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ One of the managers of a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> bar, himself a recovering alcoholic, decided adults needed a place to go to dance and party without being exposed to booze, like the non-alcoholic clubs for teen-agers. So one night a week the <ORGANIZATION> Night </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VIP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION> becomes Club Soda, where the drinks are no stronger than the name implies.

 The dance music pulses through the art deco nightclub with its mirrored walls as bartenders hurriedly stir, shake and blend exotic drinks. The adult crowd at Club Soda is partying this Friday night, but they are all sober. There is no alcohol in the drinks. `` It's a major nightclub. It has everything but the booze,'' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>, one of the managers of <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION>, a Friday night non-alcoholic alternative for adults who want to party without getting drunk. `` There are people out there that just ca n't drink and they have no where to go.'' There are many nightclubs offering dancing and a club ambiance without alcohol for teen-agers, but a boozeless bar for adults is unusual, says <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>'s partner, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlay </PERSON>. `` We could pack them in with kids, but at the same time, that's not what we were looking for,'' Rowlay says Except for Friday nights, <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION> is actually the Night Life <ORGANIZATION> VIP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION>, a full-service bar. And the decision to ban booze each Friday night, typically a busy night for bars, was something personal for <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic. `` I'm recovering and I've met through my past two years out there a different breed of people that enjoy life without the sauce,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. `` I'm just tired of reading, ` Just say no to drugs and say no to booze.' You've got to do something. Anybody can say that; it's time we show people how to live. I feel real good about it.'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> credits Night Life owners <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStazio </PERSON>, his employers for a number of years, with giving him the chance to try the no-booze bar. It's an idea that Night Life beverage manager <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szmajlo </PERSON> endorses. `` You've got people that maybe should n't be drinking, that do n't want to drink and are off the sauce, who want to come out and have that same atmosphere, a party night, and not get drunk,'' <PERSON> Szmajlo </PERSON> says Does the lack of alcohol mean a dull crowd? Not according to Club Soda's two managers. `` It's like ` Is there life without drinking?' Yeah, there sure is,'' <PERSON> Rowlay </PERSON> says. `` The important thing is people who do n't drink are no different from people that do, I mean in terms of dullness. Because you have some people who do n't drink who are dull and you have some people who do drink who are dull.'' The Club Soda drink menu runs the gamut from the ever-popular <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON>, ginger ale with a dash of grenadine, to more exotic items such as the Lemon Spritzer, <PERSON> Pineburst </PERSON> and a host of frozen coladas, as well a mineral water, cappucino and expresso coffees. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrozinski </PERSON>, head bartender at <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION>, says the fancy drinks, at $ 3.50 a pop, are big sellers. `` There's not much call for non-alcoholic beer so we discontinued it.'' he said. `` The help has been very supportive of this and it's tough to find bartenders that will work without getting the tips that they're accustomed to in a real bar,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. The club, which opened Feb. 27, averages 130 to 150 people a night, <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. Most non-drinkers are discovering the club by word-of-mouth although the club purchased a few ads in the local newspaper. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Killiany </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, heard about the club in an alcoholism recovery program in which she participates. `` I do n't miss not having drinks, not at all,'' she says. `` I like it here a lot. The mirrors and the non-alcoholic drink. Hang around, you'll see, it's a gas. It's worth the drive.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Corriveau </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, is becoming a regular. `` There's not too many places you can dance without alcohol being around and we just started to avoid those places,'' he says. `` We're recovering from that alcohol experience and being around those kinds of bars is not good.'' There is a doorman at Club Soda, not to check ID's but to check for boozers and potential troublemakers. The doorman does not admit anyone who has been drinking. `` Some people may come in for a goof, but that's on them,'' <PERSON> Perugini </PERSON> says. `` They're the ones who paid the five bucks to come in and walk right out.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's something of a cross between `` <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>'s Believe It or Not'' and `` 60 Minutes,'' which may have inspired its name Soviet television's rapid-fire news show `` 600 Seconds,'' which unabashedly seeks out the sensational and often tweaks the establishment, has become immensely popular since it went on the air. Before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power, such a program would have been unthinkable in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A lost bull roams a busy city street. Prostitutes woo foreign customers. A holiday bombing rips off a man's legs. These and other eye-opening images are flashing across Soviet television screens as glasnost, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for openness, goes video Traditionally, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has used state-run television as it did other media _ to reach the masses with propaganda, rather than programs about things that directly affect their lives or were just plain fun. The airwaves are still full of dull documentaries on subjects such as the grain harvest. The leadership still commands unlimited time, and news shows spend a lot of time reporting lists of government leaders seeing each other off on trips. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a more lively TV personality than his predecessors, and frequently turns to television to make speeches and broadcast his street-side talks with people. For the first time this winter, parliamentary candidates debated each other on television. Western music videos are shown routinely, `` space bridges'' bring the uncensored views of Western studio audiences into Soviet living rooms, and an occasional foreign commercial or film gives Soviets a glimpse of Western lifestyles. One trailblazing program, which featured the offbeat stories about the bull, the prostitutes and the bombing, is `` 600 Seconds,'' a fast-paced live show on <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> television that has become a smash hit since its premiere in December 1987. One avid fan of 30-year-old anchorman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Nezorov </PERSON> said the program `` shows the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people what they were torn away from all their lives, things that we learned to close our eyes to.'' Six days a week, 15 million people in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other regions can switch on their TV sets to catch up on the latest sensations from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. `` 600 Seconds,'' the news magazine show `` Fifth Wheel,'' the debate program `` Public Opinion'' and the music discussion program `` Musical Boxing Ring'' make <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> television among the most progressive in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, reinforcing the reputation of the city built by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON> as a window on the West. `` 600 Seconds'' is like a cross between `` <LOCATION> Ripley </LOCATION>'s Believe It or Not'' and `` 60 Minutes.'' Leningraders have nicknamed the show, `` Our City Scandal-Monger.'' At 10 p.m., a rock music introduction is followed by 10 minutes of news reports read live by a studio announcer, and videotaped reports presented rapid-fire in a down-to-earth style. A digital clock flashes periodically onto the screen to tick down the remaining seconds. Everything about the show sets it apart from ordinary broadcasts, which are presented in formal language in detail, and are visually dull. The show's popularity is evident to the staff. About 200 calls and dozens of letters a day pour into the tiny, dingy room in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s TV center where two harried producers and <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON> work under a crumbling portrait of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. Ironically, no portrait of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose glasnost policy made the program possible, hangs on the wall. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>'s irreverence surfaces in every broadcast. He relishes stirring up the town with what he calls `` sensations.'' The program consists largely of crime reports, but also has a heavy dose of the bizarre, such as a story about the city's dirtiest toilet. In a recent broadcast, `` 600 Seconds'' took on one of the city's biggest department stores, accusing its employees of selling highly sought Finnish clothing under the table The store demanded a retraction, but <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON> told viewers later that police had investigated and that `` no excuses can be made.'' The program has stopped reporting about dogs, says producer <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shishkin </PERSON>, because the staff was swamped with calls for days by people offering to adopt a canine after one broadcast reported the dog's owner had been killed in a car accident. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>, the show's co-creator and main anchor, races around this city of 4.9 million people all day to gather material for his Monday-through-Saturday broadcast, relying heavily on tips from the public and police. He has become a celebrity without any of the perks that would go along with such status in the West _ no secretary, no private office, no chauffeur-driven limousine and a salary of only $ 475 a month. Adoring fans place flowers on his car and beg for autographs. The Soviet press has praised his pioneering style, and colleagues say he has an uncanny sense of what will excite the public. Journalism students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are studying his program as a model of how news should be reported on television. But <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON> rejects the label journalist. He is a former horse trainer and TV scriptwriter, and bristles when the word journalist is mentioned. Most Soviet journalists, he said, could not come up with the stories he does, and he does n't agree with the Western notion that journalists should be objective and not sensationalize the news. He openly acknowledges that cooperatives, the fledgling private businesses spawned by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, are a target. `` Whenever we have the opportunity to nail them, we do,'' he says. The public turns to `` 600 Seconds'' to fight the Soviet bureaucracy. On one recent afternoon, a caller asked the program to prod city authorities to clean up garbage piling up outside his apartment window. `` 600 Seconds'' and other <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> TV programs have helped lift the veil from subjects such as homelessness, rape, prostitution, murder and robbery, and taken aim at a particularly touchy subject, privileges of the Soviet elite. One episode of `` Fifth Wheel,'' for instance, complained that elaborate government homes were being well maintained next to a childrens hospital that was a shambles. But there are still forbidden themes. <PERSON> Nevzorov </PERSON>'s boss, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurkov </PERSON>, said reports on unconstitutional or illegal events are barred unless they are accompanied by critical commentary. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, who is fighting to reform Soviet TV, said reforms can be difficult. `` I also have my bosses. We have our minister. He has his deputies ... And it is not always possible to overcome psychologically these traditions.''

 While much of Soviet television is looking more Western, the man who reads the news to millions every night prefers to do things the old-fashioned way. `` Hello, comrades,'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> says as he peers through thick bifocals to begin Vremya, the nightly news on state-controlled television. He has uttered those same words since Vremya first went on the air on Jan. 1, 1968, and became a main news source for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 285 million people. While other Soviet TV programs and the press are tapping glasnost, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, to air sensations about crime, history, or life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> has remained almost as dull as it was 21 years ago. When the superpowers agreed last March that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would travel to the country he had called an `` evil empire,'' a major announcement worldwide, Soviets had to sit through two hours of a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speech about farming and a story about domestic ethnic strife before learning the news from <LOCATION> Vremya </LOCATION>, which is Russian for time. Vremya still dwells on long-winded reports about the Soviet economy, often featuring tractors plowing farm fields and therefore dubbed `` tractor news.'' nd in static pictures that make Western producers cringe, cameras often fix on <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> and other announcers reading lengthy government statements. Vremya has its high points, however. When an earthquake killed thousands on Dec. 7 in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, Vremya aired a dramatic report from the scene within hours and kept on top of the story for weeks. <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON>, 57, read the news during the `` period of stagnation,'' the conservative rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, and has continued through the glasnost years. Interviewed in Vremya's tiny studio, <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> compared the program, then and now. `` Earlier it was good,'' he said through gritted teeth, indicating some discomfort with that evaluation. Switching to his full baritone voice, he added: `` Now it is also good.'' Other TV programs borrow the style of American broadcasts. <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> concedes he watches the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, but says he is sticking to his old-fashioned, formal style. `` We like not to rush, so it comes from the soul,'' he says. Trained as an actor, he believes anchormen should express their opinions through intonation and gestures. But <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> is part of a vanishing breed. In five to 10 years, he predicts, multitalented professionals of a `` higher level intellectually'' will replace <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION>'s theatrically trained announcers. A new man in charge of Vremya described the ideal anchorman. `` He should be a little bit of a journalist, a little bit of an actor, a little bit of a politician,'' says <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Producers are spicing up Vremya with graphics, foreign video plucked off communications satellites, and shorter, more interesting and timely reports. <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON> says Vremya lags behind other programs because it was born before glasnost, when `` there was a big difference between politics and real life,'' and `` because it has much official and government information.'' But, he adds, `` Tractor news is really a tradition that we must abandon. For decades, the impression was formed that economic information must occupy the top place.'' Pressure for change is coming from many directions. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda said in 1986 the program was dull, and TV officials agree it still is. `` It must be more dynamic, more informative, more visual,'' says <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurkov </PERSON>, a top official of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> television, popular for its Western-style programs. <PERSON> Sagalayev </PERSON>, who gained a reputation as a reformer when he produced the live news and entertainment show <PERSON> Vzglyad </PERSON>, agrees and he hopes to make Vremya more appealing. `` News should be what interests millions of viewers, and not a small group of people,'' he says.

 <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON>'s earlier work for the producers of `` Empty Nest'' almost prevented her from getting a role in the new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy. The show, about a recently widowed pediatrician who suddenly finds himself living alone, was created by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who also created `` Soap'' and `` The Golden Girls.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, the self-absorbed daughter of the pediatrician, played by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, and sister of a policewoman, played by <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> <PERSON> McNichol </PERSON>. `` They auditioned hundreds of actresses,'' she says. `` Everybody I knew went in for that role. They could n't find what they were looking for.'' It would seem that <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> would have had an edge because she had played <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefkowitz </PERSON> in `` Soap'' for the producers, <PERSON> Witt-Thomas-Harris </PERSON>. But, she says, `` They did n't think I was right for the part at first because of the work I'd done in ` Soap.' The characters were different. They did n't want the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Jewish, fast-talking, tough Mafia princess I played in ` Soap.' I'd played the same kind of character in the movie ` I Ought To Be in Pictures.' `` So I asked to read. When I read I made sure that none of that was showing. And they saw it and cast me.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> says she has `` a real affinity'' for the writing of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I understand her rhythm,'' she says. `` I understand her language.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> also claims an affinity with her character in `` Empty Nest.'' `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, in my mind, is always on her way to therapy or coming from therapy,'' she says. `` She's usually in a self-absorbed state of mind. For me, the character is rooted in PMS, pre-menstrual syndrome. `` My favorite line is when <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> comes bounding down the stairs and says, ` My greatest fear has happened. I'm falling in love.' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> says, ` My greatest fear is that there is no such thing as PMS and this is who I really am.' Every woman in the audience howled for 10 minutes. That's who <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> is and who I am on my worst days.'' She disagrees with descriptions of <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> as neurotic. `` She's just terribly self-involved,'' she says `` Everything has to revolve around her. If there's a disaster somewhere, her only thought is how does it affect her. She regularly takes her emotional temperature.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> grew up in a show business family. Her mother is actress-director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and her stepfather is producer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Feury </PERSON>. Last summer she worked in `` Boy's Life,'' a movie made on location in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> directed by her mother and produced by her stepfather. `` It was very interesting,'' she says. `` It was kind of like being 14 and told to clean up your room. That's the downside. The upside is that she and I are very close friends and very admiring of each other as actresses and artists. `` I know my work is safe with her because she will only let me do good work. But when she's directing we have to go back to a child-parent relationship. It pushes all my buttons when she tells me how to fix my hair and how to dress. I try not to call her Mom on the set, but when I'm tired and cranky it slips out.'' She'd worked for her mother once before, on a TV movie called `` A Matter of Sex.'' The movie, which also starred <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, was about sexual discrimination in the workplace. She did n't begin acting until she was 19 because her mother did n't want her to be a child actor. She was a college film student briefly, then quit to pursue her acting career. `` I'd like to direct someday,'' she says, `` but I'll leave filmmaking for later in life. Acting is creative and a release from your emotions. That's fun. Directing is more comfortable and puts you in charge. As an actor you have to be open and vulnerable. As director you get to be an adult doing a grown-up job.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> studied at the Actor's Studio and made her professional debut in a production for <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> called `` The Great Cherub Knitwear Strike.'' Next, she did a small role on the TV series `` Welcome Back, Kotter.'' <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> won a <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> in 1980 for her Broadway role in `` I Ought To Be In Pictures.'' She reprised her role in the movie version. Her only other series was `` Soap,'' on which she played the daughter of a gangster and the wife of <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wass </PERSON> -RRB-. `` I was spoiled and mean, a real pain,'' she says. `` Then I turned nice. It was ` The Taming of the Shrew,' or the Jew. I became sweet and loving and there was no place for my character to go, so they killed me off.'' Her film `` Child's Play'' is just out and `` Bloodhounds of Broadway'' is due in September. Another movie, a thriller called `` Backfire,'' is coming up on Showtime. She is starting a new movie called `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Roxie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>,'' which also stars <ORGANIZATION> Winona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>.

 On one side of the stage stand the Jets, on the other side the <ORGANIZATION> Sharks </ORGANIZATION>. The rival gangs from `` West Side Story'' huddle around microphones and watch conductor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemignani </PERSON> on a small podium in the middle of a vast wood-paneled room filled with musicians. It's a Sunday morning and the cast and orchestra of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' are in <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>' Studio A on West 44th Street. The singers look at <PERSON> Gemignani </PERSON>. The conducter, wearing headphones, glances at a man standing over a control panel in a soundproof booth near the stage. Take after take is recorded until <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON> is satisfied. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, an RCA Records producer, is the man who must capture the sound of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' a celebration of some of the biggest musical hits by the famous director and choreographer. Besides a suite of dances from `` West Side Story,'' the show includes numbers from `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` The King and I,'' `` Gypsy,'' `` Peter Pan'' and others. The final result, released in May on two records or two cassettes or two compact discs, is one of the most lavish original cast recordings ever made. It includes more than 120 minutes of music and a 62-page booklet with extensive notes on each of the musicals included in the show. `` Cast albums are very demanding,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, who has been in the recording business since 1972 when he was hired by cast album guru <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. `` They require a great deal of advance preparation and a lot of study. If you're going to record the <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> ` Seventh Symphony,' you do n't have to sit there in advance and decide whether you're going to take it up a key or whether you're going to leave out the third movement. `` But in the case of a Broadway show, you have a theatrical work that's designed for the stage, and how does it translate to a record when you have nothing to go by except what you're hearing,'' he says. `` Frequently you have to change the reality of what is happening musically to re-create more accurately the memory in the listener.'' Before the taping sessions, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> was n't sure how `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' would work on record. It presented special problems. `` Most of this music is familiar, and most of it has been recorded before,'' he recalls. `` For example, you do n't want to have just another recording of ` West Side Story.' Plus there's a lot of dance music and music with no vocals in the show. So what do you do with it?'' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> decided to record not just the music, but the feel of the stage production. He brought in the cast to tape a lot of what he calls `` crowd material,'' not just the singing. In the case of the `` West Side Story'' segment, that meant having 30 or 40 or 50 people up on stage making fight or dance hall sounds for the `` Mambo'' number or the fight sequence. `` I think without that, we would have ended up with another small orchestra recording of music from ` West Side Story,''' he says. `` We wanted to make it feel like you were in the theater.'' Many of the composers and lyricists represented in `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' including <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jule </PERSON> <PERSON> Styne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnick </PERSON>, came to the February recording sessions after having pre-production conferences with <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, most Broadway musicals were recorded in one day, usually the company's day off. Some still are, but `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' took three days, spread over two weeks, to complete. For one reason, it was twice as long as a regular cast recording. It has a large cast _ 62 performers _ and a large orchestra _ 42 musicians plus two players added for the `` Fiddler on the Roof'' segment. For another, technical advances have allowed for more material to be placed on a record, tape or compact disc. `` In the old days, there was a limitation as to how much music you could put on a record without having the recording suffer technically,'' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> says. `` If there were 60 minutes worth of recordable music in a show, producers had to make some hard decisions as what to keep and what not to keep because they could n't get more than 22 or 24 minutes on a side.'' Today, compact discs can handle up to 74 or 75 minutes of material without much difficulty. More of a show can be put on a single CD than could ever fit on a record. `` Now, we say that anything worth recording, we do record,'' <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> says. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> jumped to RCA in 1974 when <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> did. He also became a producer of classical recordings, supervising albums by such orchestras as the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> conducted by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> conducted by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON>. But he also assisted <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> on some of the best cast recordings ever made, including `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>.'' His first solo cast recording as a producer was `` Starting Here, Starting Now,'' a tiny off-Broadway musical revue by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> took over its Broadway cast album production. In the last two years, he has done `` Anything Goes,'' `` Legs Diamond'' and `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' for which he won a Grammy. And RCA has dominated the cast album market since, also recording such Broadway shows as `` Chess'' and `` Sarafina!'' during the same time period. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> did n't do those recordings. They were produced by their own composers. `` I'm a strong believer in not doing what you do n't think you can do well,'' he says.

 Millions of Christians in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, faced with Moslem and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> fundamentalism, feel they are treading the narrow lip of a volcano. `` Many believe they have no future in this area,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, General-Secretary of the Cyprus-based <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have a climate of despair and hopelessness. ... Christians fear the future.'' An estimated 12 million to 14 million Christians live in the region, gathered in minority pockets among 120 million Moslems and 4 million Jews. `` As Christians, the biggest challenge we face is the rising militant fundamentalism of Islam and the militant fundamentalism of Judaism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON>, assistant professor of theology at the <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION> in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Moslem persecution of the followers of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> dates from the Crusades, when they were viewed as fifth columnists for the invading Europeans who came to recover the Holy Land. That suspicion lingers. `` Fundamentalists ought to understand that pluralism in the Arab world is a necessity of life,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliya </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` If not, believe me, extremism breeds only opposite extremism.'' In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> see their fight in a 14-year-old civil war as another chapter in a centuries-old struggle for survival against Islam. The Maronites, the only Christians to have held political power in the modern Arab world, claim that <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Shiite Moslems want to create an Islamic state modeled on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Their fight to hold onto their traditional privileges is the taproot of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. `` They're the only <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> community with a distinct political history,'' said Professor <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Salibi </PERSON>, who teaches history at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. `` They fear being overwhelmed. ... If the system is democratized they would be outvoted and they ca n't carry the day.'' Maronite extremism is the starkest Christian reaction to the growth of both Islamic and Jewish fundamentalism in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Christians increasingly believe that if they do not assert their own beliefs they might be subsumed by fundamentalist zeal. `` In addition to sharing with everyone else the wars, the economic problems, the Great Power challenges, ... Christians are caught between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the one hand and Islam on the other,'' the Council of Churches' <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> said. But their leaders fear that an aggressive response could trigger their own destruction. The tension pushes thousands to emigrate. The Maronites, once slightly more than 50 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s population, have dwindled to about 30 percent Christians who remain in the region worry about the loss of their special identity. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON>, a Christian mother living in predominately Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, says she sends her four children as often as she can to the Christian sector. `` I do n't want them to end up marrying Moslems,'' she said. Moslems see the Maronites as warring to keep their lockhold on the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s presidency and other centers of power reserved for them since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s laws, all citizens are guaranteed equal civil rights. But its creation as a state for Jews effectively marginalized Christians, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leaders say. The political factor is heightened because most Christians in the Holy Land are Palestinians, who fundamentalist Jewish groups seek to expel from the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 war. In the Islamic belief, Christians and Jews are considered harbingers of the true faith and are protected as fellow believers in the Old Testament. But there is a deep fear `` of fundamentalists overthrowing existing regimes and establishing societies based on Sharia -LRB- Islamic law -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>. These laws include banning pork, veiling women, cutting off the hands of convicted thieves and stoning adulteresses. Only about 180,000 Christians, mostly Armenians, remain in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands left after the 1979 Islamic revolution instituted <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>. `` You ca n't study Armenian or the Bible there,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a 15-year-old whose family moved to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> so he could enroll in the Armenian school. `` There are lots of extra lessons _ Arabic, the <LOCATION> Koran </LOCATION>, Persian _ which I wo n't need in the future,'' he said. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is locked in a civil war because Christians in its south loath the Islamic rules voted in by the northern Moslems. Moslem clerics call such fears baseless.

 <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual guide of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> ` s <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists, said Christians should be guided by the Biblical verse: `` Render unto <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> what is <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s and unto God what is God's.'' `` There's no conflict between Christianity and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> when Islam demands the implementation of <ORGANIZATION> Sharia </ORGANIZATION>,'' he added. `` What's the difference between implementing the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> order in a Christian area and implementing the Marxist or the French or any other system in a Christian area?'' The problem, Christians say, is that a religious state would intervene. They noted, for example, that fundamentalist Moslem militias forced the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> to alter its courses of study. The Koran, Islam's holy book, was dropped from a cultural studies course after the fundamentalists objected its use as one text among many. They also objected to Christians teaching about Islam. In <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the Moslem-Christian strain starts with the census. Militant Christian Copts claim they number 12 million. The government sets the number at 3 million. The true figure is believed to be around 7 million. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalist underground occasionally vents its anger on the Copts, who trace their beginnings to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> in the year 50. The Moslem militants who assassinated President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in 1981 were accused of robbing rich Coptic jewellers for funds. Violence erupted in the Egyptian fundamentalist strongholds of <LOCATION> Minya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Assiut </LOCATION> in 1987 after the fundamentalists accused Copts of spraying crosses on Moslems' clothing. Copts do attain influential positions in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s government. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, and the ministers of emigration and international cooperation are Copts. Their co-religionists have reached high posts in the judiciary and the army. But none has ever been defense minister or commander-in-chief. They also face some legal restrictions. For example, a Coptic man can marry a Moslem woman only if he converts to Islam. `` Copts always have to do things by the back door,'' said one man who produces and distributes Bible-study videos. `` Copts feel a certain insecurity,'' said an Egyptian who would identify himself only by his first name, <PERSON> Henein </PERSON>. `` They do n't have easy access to superior positions.'' The covert discrimination often tips the scales for Christians deciding to emigrate. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has a secular government but bans Christians from government posts. Christians there said the historical animosity between the two communities has ebbed, but many high school students emigrate, leaving behind an increasingly elderly community. Fewer than 10,000 Christians remain in the old city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, according to church statistics. Some fear it might shrink to the point of virtual extinction. `` Christianity might be represented by monuments, buildings and stones rather than by people,'' said the Most Rev. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafity </PERSON>, Anglican bishop of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Most Western Christians `` do n't realize there's a living Christian community in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ramy </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, a publisher and writer in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` When they come here and see Christians they're slightly surprised.'' In many Arab countries, Christians try to keep a low profile to avoid trouble. In <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coptic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenouda </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, recently blocked an attempt to form a Coptic political party. `` Those who want peace and national unity must mesh with their Moslem brothers,'' he said. `` Establishing a Christian party will create negative reactions.''

 Moslems recognize <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a prophet, but the Crusades in the Middle Ages planted suspicions among them that Christians were allied with those who wanted to subvert Islam. Those suspicions are rekindled today by a new kind of Crusader, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> evangelists such as Americans <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. They preach that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fulfills Biblical prophecies predicting the arrival of a new Messiah and seek to convert Moslems. `` The Crusaders came out of the conviction that we were not Christian enough,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Habib </PERSON>, General Secretary of the Cyprus-based <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. Crusader castles dot the modern states of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, symbols that Christianity, although born in the Holy Land, was later a colonizer. Now the Christian fundamentalists are `` projecting an image of Christianity of political and economic power. It's the image of a new crusade, this time allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> said. The fundamentalist groups have opened the so-called <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has its capital, to spread their teachings. A glossy tract published by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> church says: `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is coming to rule _ from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> has a television station in an Israeli-held sector of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has been destroyed twice in bombing attacks. The station's administrative manager, who agreed to be interviewed only on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a personal statement and the station tries to avoid politics Almost 70 percent of its programming ranges from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> football to `` Magnum P.I.,'' he said. But he noted that the rest are `` programs to inspire people in their faith.'' Pro-Iranian Moslem militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would like to see these off the air, he said. Evangelical groups say they work in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> because the region's Christians, isolated in minority pockets around the Arab world, are not forceful enough. Seeking converts `` is what the Gospel calls them to do among their own people,'' said a missionary with the Assembly of God who did not want his name used because it might limit his ability to travel in the region. `` I wish every Coptic priest, every <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest would do it,'' he added.

 These are the five main Christian groups of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 ORIENTAL ORTHODOX CHURCHES _ Founded in <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>'s early years, these are independent churches linked to specific nations or ethnic groups. The Coptic Orthodox Church, believed founded by <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> in the year 50, is the largest in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with about 7 million followers, mostly in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The others are the 2-million member <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian Orthodox Church.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCHES _ Also known as Greek Orthodox, these are self-governing and differ from the Oriental Orthodox churches on doctrinal decisions handed down before the year 800. The largest is the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of <LOCATION> Antioch </LOCATION> and All the East, with about 1.3 million followers, mostly in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Others include the the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Church of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION>, represented by about a dozen monks at the famous shrine where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 CATHOLICS _ They consist of seven branches. All but the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Christian sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, broke from branches of the Orthodox churches. The Maronites claim to have 1 million members in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and 6.7 million outside the region. The others range in membership from 30,000 to 300,000 and include the <ORGANIZATION> Chaldean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriarchate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babylon </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Christian community in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriarchate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION>, which celebrates its liturgy in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' language of Aramaic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 ASSYRIAN CHURCH OF THE EAST _ Its largest group, 250,000 members, is in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The church long been pilloried by others Christians, allegedly for following the teachings of Nestorius, an excommunicated 5th century patriarch of Constantinople.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROTESTANTS _ Now numbering about 100,000 members, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches were established in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the early 19th century by missionaries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> evangelistic groups, such as those led by the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, are active in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 If there's a deep black hole in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has been in it. But now, as some of its more advanced neighbors might be on the verge of falling in, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> may be coming out. The light at the top offers hope for the poorest country on the continent but it's still only a glimmer. This is one in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic, social and political turbulence that has turned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into a continent in crisis.

<TEXT>
 A remarkable economic turnaround and a newfound political stability are giving hope to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country that perhaps most needs it. But despite <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s visions of a brighter future, its present remains bleak: _ Of every 10 workers, two ca n't find jobs and one has turned to the illegal cocaine business _ One of every 10 newborns does n't survive infancy _ the worst rate in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> _ Of every 1,000 Bolivians, 14 die each year That's nearly double the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> average. The new leadership that will grapple with the country's grave problems wo n't be known until at least Aug. 4, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes to choose a new president. In a general election May 7, all candidates fell short of the absolute majority needed for direct election, so the legislature must pick from the top three finishers: <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, the former dictator <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>. All three have pledged, however, to stick with an economic program that transformed <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most chaotic nation into what some are calling a Third World model. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has had 76 governments since independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1825 _ half of them de facto military governments and the other half democratically elected. From 1978 to 1982, its 6.9 million people _ many of them descendants of an Indian culture that predated Inca conquests in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> by several centuries _ saw eight changes of government. They included three bloody military coups. Democracy was re-established in 1982, but the government of then-President <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON> proved unable to reverse an economic tailspin and an inflation rate that soared to an inconceivable rate of 23,000 percent a year. A 10-million peso note shrank in value to $ 5, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> confessed to not a penny in reserves. When President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> was elected to replace <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuazo </PERSON> in 1985, he declared simply but dramatically: `` <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is dying on us.'' His government prescribed a drastic cure: a 95-percent currency devaluation, an end to subsidized prices and a 10-fold increase in the price of gasoline, and the layoff of 35,000 state tin miners and other government employees. While public spending was slashed, an effective new tax system brought in additional revenues. The new program was put to an immediate test when world market prices for tin and oil, the country's main exports, plunged drastically. The plan nonetheless took hold. Inflation dropped and leveled off at about 10 percent a year _ among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s lowest rates. In 1987 and 1988, the country enjoyed modest but steady economic growth for the first time in many years. Once-scarce foreign investment is picking up, as is foreign aid. Some factories and new homes and office buildings are going up. With new tax revenues, the government is paving streets and painting public buildings. `` <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is a country that has made a complete turnaround,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It has reversed the trend toward economic collapse and established the base for recovery.'' <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said he expects the recovery to continue no matter which of the three candidates is chosen president, since each is committed to the program. `` I'm very optimistic.'' <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, said the Bolivian program `` represents a very important example for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other countries that are passing through a similar situation.'' While such countries as nearby <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> try to entangle themselves from foreign debt, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, because of its poverty, is under less pressure from foreign creditors. Unlike other debtor countries, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> owes most of its $ 4.2-billion foreign debt to governments or international assistance agencies, which have been more willing to reschedule payment. Commercial lenders have virtually written off the $ 700 million <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> owes them, and has allowed the government to buy half of it back at 11 percent of its face value.

 With economic stability has come political steadiness. When <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> hands over power in August, he'll be the first elected president to finish out his full term in 25 years. But the social cost of the program has been excruciating, nevertheless, and the benefits so far have not reached many of the jobless or the 2 million peasant farmers who know only of subsistence. Unemployment rose to a staggering 25 percent _ and still remains above 20 percent. Without government subsidies, prices for many basic goods soared to levels similar to those of industrialized countries, while wages remained at Third World levels. The minimum legal wage is equivalent to $ 1.50 a day. In a wrenching upheaval, thousands of ex-miners were forced to abandon the homes on the windy high plains. Among them were Indians whose ancestors had lived there for millenia. About 75 percent of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s people are of Quechua or Aymaya Indian ancestry and about half the population lives in the countryside. Many moved into the swollen shantytowns on the fringes of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> and other major cities. Others descended into the tropical lowlands and began growing coca, the raw material for cocaine. Of a national work force of about 3 million, an estimated 300,000 make their livelihood in some aspect of the cocaine industry _ growing, processing or smuggling. The business brings in $ 200 million to $ 300 million a year _ equal to about half all legal export earnings. Indeed, the drug profits helped cushion the impact of the government belt-tightening policies. Some say the country must now be gently weaned from the illicit activity. `` A complete curtailment of cocaine without viable alternatives could be devastating to the national economy,'' said a Maryknoll priest, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. He works with addicted and abandoned children in the city of <LOCATION> Cochabamba </LOCATION>, the gateway to the country's principal coca-growing area, the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION> The government, as well as all three top presidential candidates, oppose forced eradication of coca farms by burning or spraying with herbicides, as is being tried in other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries. Instead they favor a U.S.-financed plan, now in its third year, to persuade coca farmers to switch to other crops and to leave the now-overpopulated <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION>. But they also contend that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other wealthy cocaine-importing countries must put up more money for the program _ some $ 300 million to $ 500 million over a three-year period. `` The big problem is getting the developed world to cooperate,'' said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s conservative Revolutionary Nationalist Movement. `` They seem to prefer to have somebody they can blame the drug problem on rather than finding a solution.'' `` If you give us the resources, we have the will,'' he added in a conversation with foreign reporters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends about $ 55 million a year on drug interdiction and crop-switching programs in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. It provides more than $ 100 million a year in aid to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. In all, foreign aid from the industrialized world and international lending agencies is expected to total $ 365 million in loans and donations this year. Government officials recognize that the assistance is vital to health programs and development projects aimed at bettering life in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest country. Authorities agree that the country's most desperate need is more and better-paying jobs. They expect that to result from the economic growth the country now is enjoying but acknowledge that the process is a gradual one. Among the new private investors are several foreign mining and petroluem companies. But the country sees a need to reduce its heavy reliance on mineral production by promoting non-traditional exports such as soya, lumber, fruit, flowers and alpaca wool. In 1992, a natural gas sales contract with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> that provides more than half of the country's export earnings will expire. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has begun negotiating with another neighbor, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, to sell them gas but the arrangements will take several more years.

 Here are some facts and figures on <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE LAND _ <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is landlocked in the heart of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and is roughly the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> combined. It is is divided into three distinct geographical regions: the highlands, the mountainous valley regions and sub-tropical lowlands. Major cities such as <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Potosi </PERSON> are part of the Andes mountain range. The lowlands include the vast savannas and impenetrable jungles of the <LOCATION> Beni </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pando </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> departments, which are traversed by thousands of miles of rivers that feed into the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE PEOPLE _ <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 6.9 population is largely made up of people of <LOCATION> Quechua </LOCATION> and Aymara Indian origin. Although Spanish is the official language, Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken in rural areas and in major cities. In the tropical regions, <LOCATION> Guarani </LOCATION> and other native languages are also spoken. The population is largely Roman Catholic, although Indian farmers maintain a mixture of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Indian beliefs that include worship of a goddess of the earth. The last two decades have seen a significant migration of Quechua and Aymara farmers to the lowland regions, including areas that produce sugar cane, coffee and coca leaf, which is processed into cocaine.
</TEXT>

 THE HISTORY _ Aymara and other Indian cultures, which predate by several centuries the Inca conquest of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, established an elaborate system of government and built the city of <LOCATION> Tiwanacu </LOCATION> with its vast irrigated fields and elaborate stone and ceramic figures. The <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> conquered the highlands and some of the lowland regions of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in the 13th century. The Spanish conquerors took over in 1538. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, which is named after its liberator <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON>, became independent from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1825 and separated itself from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. In a series of wars over the next century, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> lost its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, part of its <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and some of its southern territory to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>.

 THE ECONOMY _ <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has a free market economy that has begun to see stability. In 1985, tough austerity measures were used to control hyper-inflation, which had soared to 23,000 percent. Inflation has plunged to 15 percent and the government estimates that the economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 1989. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> seeks foreign investors interested in mining, petroleum exploration and agriculture. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is still heavily dependent, however, on cocaine trafficking, which brings in an estimated $ 200 million to $ 300 million a year and provides a livelihood to 300,000 Bolivians. Natural gas, which earned $ 214 million in exports last year, has supplanted minerals as the main source of export earnings, which totalled $ 600.5 million in 1988. Mineral exports amounted to $ 196 million in 1988.

 THE CULTURE _ <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has a rich and dynamic culture rooted in its Indian heritage. Aymara and Quechua Indians make exquisite weavings and outfits and have elaborate rituals and festivals that date to pre-Colombian times. The rich cultural diversity is manifest during carnival in the mining city of <LOCATION> Oruro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poder </LOCATION> in La Paz when thousands of dancers wearing elaborate masks and outfits pay homage to patron saints. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> also has a rich musical and visual arts tradition.

 <PERSON> Heinz-Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Distel </PERSON>, leathery hands gripping an iron shipwheel, guides his 1,200-ton live-in barge downriver in a family tradition nearly as old as the medieval castles looming on both sides of the mighty <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I was born on the water, and I do n't really have any desire to leave it. This is in my blood,'' says <PERSON> Distel </PERSON>, part of a breed of fiercely independent West Germans who work and live on family-owned transport barges. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Helga </PERSON>, are the sole owners, operators and residents of the <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON> <PERSON> Monheim </PERSON>, a workhorse barge that's nearly the length of a football field and has most of the comforts of a conventional home. The 52-year-old <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> is a man of few words. Ensconsed high up in the pilot house next to his multi-band radio, he keeps his vision firmly fixed on the fast-running river and steers a steady course through central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Twin diesel engines throb powerfully below, propelling the vessel at a good clip past famous old castles like the picturesque <LOCATION> Marksburg </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Koblenz </LOCATION>. The Drachenfels, a mountain where the legendary Germanic hero <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> slew a dragon, appears in the distance as the <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON> <PERSON> Monheim </PERSON> glides north. <PERSON> Helga </PERSON>, <PERSON> Distel </PERSON>'s 47-year-old wife and sole crewmember, carries a tray with vegetable soup, wurst and pudding up the outside iron staircase to her husband from their living quarters on the rear deck. She ducks quickly into the pilot house, helped out by a strong Rhine wind blowing across the port side. Another barge comes into view on the starboard side, and Mrs. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> waves enthusiastically to the people on board. `` We know them and a lot of other people who work on the river,'' she said. `` Sometimes we'll put into port with friends and have a little party. But it could be a month or more before we're ever with them again. It's just another work day for the Distels, who consented to take an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter on board for the day on the stretch in central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Distels are still enraptured by the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s landscape even though it is a normal part of their daily lives. But this is clearly not the life for anyone. `` It is not what most people would call an easy life _ we're under way 14 hours a day, sometimes 10 days straight, and we're never sure when we might be able to take a day off,'' said Mrs. But the Distels say as long as they're willing to work long hours, they can make a pretty good living. And it's not every family that has the chance to cut across the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> week after week, visiting historic cities like <LOCATION> Basel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Heidelberg </LOCATION>, and crossing into <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> as well. `` I really enjoy doing this, and I would n't trade it for anything else in the world,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON>, who paints Rhine landscape pictures when she's not busy with chores. Fewer and fewer families are able to afford running a barge business because of skyrocketing costs and stiff competition from powerful shipping companies and the railroad. Some 2,000 family-owned, live-in barges were registered in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1980, but the figure has dropped to about 1,300. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> is a member of one of the most venerable West German families still operating barges, tracing his forebearers' river-working roots back to the 16th century <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> was born on a barge, and spent most of his life on river boats owned by his grandfather and father. `` I went to a special boarding school for kids in shipping families until I was 17,'' <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> said while on the three-day run from <LOCATION> Ludwigshafen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> with a load of liquid fertilizer. The Distels' 19-year-old daughter, who has chosen a career in marketing and lives on land, also attended such a school. During his own school years, <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> would join his family on their boat during holidays and vacation time. `` I've never felt at home on land. So when I finished school I came to my real home _ the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> does a lot of the strenuous mechanical work on his 40-year-old <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON> <PERSON> Monheim </PERSON> _ named after a <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town near <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. And he oversaw the mammoth job a few years ago of replacing the original engines for smaller but more efficient ones. Like other barge families, the Distels own a thoroughly modernized vessel loaded with domestic conveniences. They even have a car strapped onto the deck for use when they go into port. Their living quarters consist of a carpeted living room, a complete kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and washing machine, and a large bedroom. Book cases line the walls of the living room, where there is a sofa and easy chairs, a caged parakeet they call `` Peterle'' and a color television set. Most of the Distels' travels are on the Rhine, but their contracts with various companies take them up and down other rivers as well, such as the Neckar and Mosel. They reach <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> and other places via a web of canals leading off the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>. Living on the river also has its dangerous side, and families can face financial ruin from running aground and other accidents. But Mrs. <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> says they've been fortunate and attributes that to her husband's navigational skill and understanding of the river. `` I could never work for anyone else, because you lose your independence,'' <PERSON> Distel </PERSON> said. `` I'd much rather be my own man. And I know where I belong _ on the river.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Fifty years ago on June 6, a group of neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a scaled-down field in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. They called it the Little League. Today more than 2.5 million young boys and girls play on 140,000 Little League baseball teams in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 33 foreign countries. But despite its immense popularity, the organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the Little League turned out.

 When you drive south on Route 15 in north-central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, just as you top the crest of <ORGANIZATION> Bald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> pull over and cast your gaze to the valley below. If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of Little League baseball, you are looking at it. The <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, its very name a poem, winds down from the green <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> hills through a town of 40,000 souls who live in clapboard houses with porch swings and shade trees, a timeless scene off a postcard labeled `` America.'' Move closer. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag large enough to cover a small infield draws your eye to the north bank of the river. It flies proudly in front of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields, the international headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this year Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6, 1939, have grandchildren playing in the league today. Still, a half-century seems a relatively brief span for any activity, however appealing, to attain such astonishing growth and earn such a solid place in the national culture. A Little League ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities, villages and suburbs across the land. A three-team league of 30 <ORGANIZATION> Williamsport </ORGANIZATION> boys in 1939 was the seedbed for what <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today calls the largest sports organization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on 140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 33 foreign countries. If all the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaguers </ORGANIZATION> joined hands the line would stretch from the Susquehanna to the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. `` Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,'' says <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, who founded the league while working as a clerk in a lumber yard. `` All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhood program. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.'' At 79, <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> still lives in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>. He is a man with an incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save receipts. `` It is n't that I enjoy saving things,'' he once explained to his daughter who complained about the clutter. `` It's just that I ca n't bear to throw anything away.'' He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for the first Little League season came to $ 174.63, that the collection taken up at the first game netted $ 1.42, that the first boy-sized catcher's mask, ordered from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and which he still has, cost $ 1.67, the first dozen balls $ 2. The first year's deficit was $ 36.72, which <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> made up out of his own pocket as he did every year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black. Now Little League, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has assets of more than $ 10 million and a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges each of those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $ 14 each year and earns millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the Little League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> designed. The business of Little League is unquestionably big league. <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>'s memory of how it all began is vivid. One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two nephews, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehron </PERSON>, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at 1108 <LOCATION> Isabella </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Running </LOCATION> backward, he tripped over the jagged stumps of a cut-down lilac <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and bruised his ankle. His left ankle. `` I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing, `` rubbing my ankle. `` I said to the boys, ` How would you like to play on a regular team with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you can really swing?' `` One of them said, ` Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _ ` who would we play?' `` I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.'' <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and went to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers played softball. `` I used folded newspapers for bases, threw the ball to various positions and had the boys run the bases. We tried different distances between the bases until I found what I thought would be right for them, and paced it off. It came close enough to 60 feet that I rounded it off to that.'' Through the winter <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> worked out the details, rules, age limits and the like, which have remained essentially unchanged. He called on 57 merchants before he found the first sponsor, <ORGANIZATION> Lycoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION>. The next spring Little League was born. `` When <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> passed out the uniforms, the day before the first game, it was one of the proudest days of my life,'' recalls <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>. `` It meant it was really going to happen. Some of the guys put them on right there on the field. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Reader </PERSON> wore his to bed that night.'' <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>, who now lives in nearby <LOCATION> Montoursville </LOCATION>, hit .462 that year to become Little League's first batting champion. When Korea won the Little League World Series 1984, you can credit <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON> in part. <PERSON> Bair </PERSON> and other Little League graduates in the armed services spread Little League all across the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bair </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, now manages a <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> team in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON> recalls that late in June of the first year some fans berated the umpire until he walked off the field. `` It was the first indication,'' said <PERSON> Stotz </PERSON>, `` of the problems overzealous fans can cause.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizzo </PERSON> began as a Little League umpire in 1941 and, at 78, is still at it, conducting the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s umpiring school in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>. `` I've seen some ugly things when the parents get too excited,'' he says. `` The kids walk off the field arm-in-arm, but I know of mothers who would' t speak to each other for a month It gets worse than that. When an umpire named <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Berryhill </PERSON> called a game in <LOCATION> Waynesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on account of darkness, an irate mother hit him over the head with an umbrella.

 `` Wabbit Twouble,'' `` Bugs Bunny Classics,'' `` The Best of Bugs Bunny and Friends'' -LRB- MGM-UA Home Video -RRB- The fine print on the videocassette jacket of `` Bugs Bunny Classics'' says `` pre -'50s cartoons To cartoon buffs, that says it all. These are the great ones, the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Looney Tunes-Merrie Melodies classics that will keep you in stitches with clever lines, biting satire and unrivaled cartoon artwork Like Trix, they are definitely not just for kids. Of the three collections, top honors go to `` Bugs Bunny Classics.'' It includes `` Racketeer Rabbit,'' which parodies movie tough guys <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorre </PERSON>. `` Hare Trigger,'' an early Bugs-Yosemite <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> duel, is high on the hilarity list, as is `` Haredevil Hare,'' in which Bugs defends the honor of Earth against a little Martian with high-top sneakers named Commander X-2. The title `` The Best of Bugs Bunny & amp; Friends,'' is a considerable exaggeration. It includes the wonderful `` Tweetie Pie,'' a 1947 incarnation of that not-so-innocent `` wittle bird.'' But two of the seven cartoons contain racial stereotypes of an African hunter and American Indian that were offensive then and remain so today. As the name implies, `` Wabbit Twouble'' is 54 minutes worth of Bugs outwitting <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fudd </PERSON>. Especially funny is `` The <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hare </LOCATION>,'' in which an aging Bugs -LRB- `` dern this lumbago!'' -RRB- is still too much for hapless <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>. But `` Wabbit Twouble'' also illustrates the built-in problem Bugs' creators had: creating a comic foil smart enough to spar with the Wascally Wabbit. Over time, <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> was just too stupid to remain interesting or funny. Others, such as <PERSON> Yosemite </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> came along, but in his recent autobiography, voice impressionist <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yosemite </PERSON> was pretty tough on his vocal chords. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Memories of Me'' -LRB- CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated PG-13 -RRB- `` Memories of Me'' is almost a completely forgettable movie until its final third, when there's _ finally _ some action to the drama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years of estrangement. `` Memories'' is <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s first outing as a director and it shows in the movie's pacing. Much of the beginning is plodding and self-consciously slow. Poignant moments when young Dr. <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Polin </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> -RRB- reflects on his callous father hang relentlessly on dead air. Crystal co-wrote the film and created a girlfriend -LRB- <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> -RRB- for himself, whose role in the melodrama-comedy is vague. At times, her only purpose seems to be to admire Crystal's rear end or his sexual prowess! The plot finally gets going when <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>, after suffering a mild heart attack, treks from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to resolve the decades of paternal indifference. Once he's there, <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> learns his dad, <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> the King of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> Extras -LRB- Alan King -RRB-, has a terminal illness. They try to win <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> a speaking part in a movie and validate his oft-repeated claim, `` I am an actor.'' In the process, <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> comes to love his curmudgeonly dad, who returns the favor by softening enough to tell <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> he loves him, too, and that in his role as father he was simply miscast. It gets a bit cornball after this, but the ending is far more compelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slow start. _ By <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` In a Sentimental Mood'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Those </PERSON> who remember Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> as `` The Night Tripper'' who brought a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy. Nor would his usual concoctions of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> blues, rock and honky-tonk lead one to associate him with such Tin Pan Alley standards as `` More Than You Know'' or `` Accentuate the Positive.'' Even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of classic old songs. But as an accomplished session player, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a.k.a. Mac Rebennack, is nothing if not versatile. So when he turns his keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental ballads such as `` Candy'' and `` My Buddy,'' he knows how to create the right mood. Yet it's clear this is not the doctor's specialty. An inner sleeve note credits <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> for inspiration; the fact is, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> does it better. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s seen-it-all-and-then-some vocal style works much better on the bluesy `` Black Night'' and on `` <PERSON> Makin </PERSON>' Whoopee,'' the sassy duet with <PERSON> Rickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> that leads off the album. Teaming those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record, and it would be great to hear more from them. The other highlights are the instrumental title cut -LRB- a Duke Ellington number -RRB- and a rollicking rendition of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Love for Sale,'' both featuring Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s piano playing, his true forte _ By <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Kings of Boogie'' -LRB- GNP Crescendo -RRB- _ <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> In an age of `` classic'' soft drinks and candy bars, perhaps <PERSON> Savoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title `` Kings of Boogie.'' But as a souvenir of the coronation, this effort is pretty stale. There's plenty of boogie music here, but you've heard it all before. On any given night, there probably are hundreds of bands in bars across the country playing this type of music with more inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on `` Kings of Boogie.'' As always, bandleader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is impeccable on guitar. The rhythm section is solid and vocalist <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> can growl with the best of them. The trouble is the material: It's tired, cliched and forgettable. Oh yeah. The album's liner notes, gushing about the band's `` integrity,'' seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking `` Official Savoy Brown Merchandise. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` A Night to Remember'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> That is <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>'s name on the new album, `` A Night to Remember.'' And yes, it sure sounds like her. But for all we know, it could be <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>. Or <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>. Or <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. Fill in your own choice. Once delightfully distinctive, <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>'s taken a distressing step backward into the sea of `` wanna-bes'' with this record. The need for hits has made her music generic. The <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> on the `` She's So Unusual'' album was a joy to know. She was a tough, independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes not afraid, as the song says, to have fun. Not many artists have the guts to defend masturbation on their first album. Where did that <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> go? On the first three songs of this new record, <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> defines herself through men. There's the man she craves so much she'll drive all night to sleep with him; the man she craves so much she feels `` primitive'' urges; the man she craves so much she ca n't bear to spend that first night without him. The narrator could be anybody. Although <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON> shares songwriting credit on seven of this record's tunes, all are written at least in part by professional song doctors _ people such as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> who are brought in for artists desperate for hits. Some of the songs are good; these people did n't get their track record by chance. `` I Drove All Night,'' in particular, builds nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>. `` A Night to Remember'' is another catchy tune. However, both are weighted down by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements. Some songs are too gimmicky. `` Insecurious'' and `` Like a Cat'' are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper. None of the tunes, though, really sound like <PERSON> Lauper </PERSON>'s. Remember, this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her first starring role in a movie, `` Vibes,'' was a disaster. This record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist who's lost her confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big investment. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

The 28-year-old <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> is co-starring with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brolin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roundtree </PERSON> in the Western `` Bad Jim,'' produced by <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>'s new 21st <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The movie has been shooting in the desert plains and arroyos northwest of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, and so far young <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> has drawn high marks from his co-stars and director, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>. `` I think he's got a lot of his father in him,'' <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> said. `` He's never really acted before, he's never wanted to act before. He's a race driver. Imagine carrying the load of being the King's son I think he carries it very well.'' The resemblance is hard to fathom. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s face is long and thin, compared to his father's square-jawed look, and his hair is light brown, while <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>'s was dark. Their height is the same, but the son is slender and wiry. The greatest similarity is in the voices. Both crackle with no-nonsense authority. One recent afternoon before shooting began, <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> sat down before a frontier saloon amid a clutter of ramshackle movie sets called Cow Town and submitted to a rare interview. `` Submitted'' is an apt word, since <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> does not easily reveal himself. That is natural after a childhood in which his mother, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreckels </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, strove mightily to keep him out of public view. `` I am a private person,'' he admitted, crediting `` a little help from my wife.'' She is <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarro </PERSON>, and they have a daughter, <PERSON> Kayley </PERSON>, 3, and a son, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 7 months. But how is he going to cope with the publicity spotlight that's generated as a movie actor? `` Real simple,'' he said, `` just as if I'm a rolling billboard out there in the desert. I'll play it the same way. It's the same as in racing: It's all advertising and product.'' He is sponsored by <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheels </ORGANIZATION> in his racing career. Does he enjoy interviews? A rare grin: `` Please do n't put me on a spot like that. Yes and no. It depends.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> was born in 1960, three months after his father died of a heart attack at the conclusion of `` The Misfits.'' The boy spent his first 13 years on the 22-acre Gable ranch in the middle of <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION>. The property has since been subdivided into luxury estates, and the Gable house is now occupied by indicted junk-bond king <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. `` I went back there once and it made me sick,'' he said. `` I drove up the driveway to my old house and was so appalled at what had been done to it that I turned around and drove away.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> protected her son from the press and other intruders, sending him to private schools _ <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prep </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` She did n't like the way people handled interviews, and she wanted to protect me,'' <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> recalled. `` She was afraid of possible kidnapping. She always told me that my father told her, ` One actor in the family is enough.''' <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> spent a year at <ORGANIZATION> Aiglon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Villars </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, then graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. His fields of study included `` art, ceramics, a lot of science, art history.'' Nothing related to the entertainment business. During his college years, <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> became engrossed in motor cross racing, much to his mother's distress -LRB- she died in 1983 -RRB-. He has jolted through the grueling <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> race for almost 24 hours straight. Twice he has had serious accidents in races; one required seven hours of surgery. After four years of motor cross he switched to class-A trucks. What's so great about racing? `` I just love it, the excitement of it,'' he said. `` There's nothing like racing across the desert They used to cross the desert in covered wagons back in the 1800s. We're just modern-day cowboys in full-sized pickups now. It's pretty much the same thing; we just go a little faster and a little harder. `` Fear? I have no fear. I have more fear when I get on a horse.'' Two years ago friends saw him in television interviews about his racing and suggested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> could make it as an actor. He studied for two years in acting school _ `` a lot of improvisation, a lot of classroom work, a lot of work on my feet, with other actors or solo pieces, the basic things you learn in acting school.'' <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> submitted a script that <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> did n't like, then he was sold on `` Bad Jim.'' Now <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> would like to do more acting _ `` especially action and adventure films; I'm not very much into romance or any of that.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> first became aware of his famed father at a home screening of `` Gone With the Wind.'' `` I was 2 years old, and I could n't sit through the whole movie at that point in my life,'' he recalled. `` I was kind of rambunctious at that age.'' On another occasion he threw a glass of punch at the screen when he saw his father kissing another woman. `` I really did n't know my father,'' he remarked. `` I used to love to hear my mother tell stories about him. I was very lucky that I was able to see my father on film _ what he looked like, acting, talking, moving. I did n't really know much about my dad except the stories I've heard.'' <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> has n't seen his father's 66 films, but he hopes to see them all some day. His favorites are: `` The Misfits,'' `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' `` Test Pilot'' -LRB- his very favorite -RRB-, `` Mogambo,'' `` Gone With the Wind'' -LRB- `` of course'' -RRB-, `` Mutiny on the Bounty'' and `` Soldier of Fortune.'' He was asked for a capsule portrait of the man who was called King. His reply: `` He was a very rugged, outgoing man. He was very social and generous to people, but he also had a very private life. He loved hunting. He loved fishing. He loved fast cars. He loved motorcycles and horses.'' That might also sound like a picture of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. ` Uh-huh,'' he admitted. `` It might run in the blood.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Little Opera Fills the Bowery With Mozart and Puccini</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Stage doors sometimes stick, and smoke effects have gone up in flames. Costumes are homemade or hand-me-downs, and actors race out the theater's back door, through a parking lot and past derelicts on the street to make front stage entrances. It's all part of high opera in a distinctly low-brow area called the Bowery, one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s dingier spots. With a 24-hour car park on one side, a transient hotel and punk-rock club on the other, the narrow, four-story Amato Opera Theatre fills the Bowery with strains of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>. This everyman's opera company is the creation of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, who fell in love with opera as a youngster shortly after emigrating with his family from <PERSON> Minori </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the Amato theater's unprepossessing style is no cover for amateurish ways. Since <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> launched his opera theater 41 years ago, 65 alumni have graduated to the Metropolitan Opera, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and other companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` He was a beacon for me. There was a place I could go at a very young age and learn,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON>, a lead tenor at the Met. He went to <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> when he was 19 after being rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. After three years with the <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juilliard </PERSON> accepted him. `` The learning techniques of how to act were really from <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>,'' the 39-year-old <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> recalled in a recent interview. `` How to stand, how to really look at another singer and how to not lose the audience when you do that, or how not to sing directly to the side, into the wings. `` It was only when I sang on an international level that I realized how good <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> was. He really could take somebody from scratch and teach you stuff which a lot of directors ca n't do.'' Attracted by that reputation, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>'s amateur casts of hundreds trek over after office hours from throughout the city for a chance to learn opera's heroic and obscure roles, staging and later to perform full-length operas before tiny audiences. The converted storehouse seats about 100; folding chairs are set up for sellouts. At the <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, only the scenic designer and musicians are paid; the Amatos receive rent for the building. An annual grant from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4,000, ticket sales at $ 12 each, a handful of contract performances and contributions keep the shows running. Last year's annual budget was the highest ever, $ 100,000. The season usually includes five productions of about 10 performances each. `` People do n't really do it for money,'' said 24-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiman </PERSON>, who made his debut in March as the lead in `` The Marriage of <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, a short whirlwind of energy, controls almost every aspect of his company. He chooses the operas, stages the productions, directs the actors, changes the scenery, conducts the orchestra. He's the master of ceremonies, announcing winners of raffles for <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> T-shirts and videotaped operas. During a performance of `` Faust'' several years ago, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> even put down the baton to extinguish a fire when a smoke effect went awry. `` My theory is that to have good theater, one man has to be in charge. When you have a stage director, a music director, a scenic director and a costume director _ too much friction, too much time wasted. I experienced it many, many years ago. That's why I decided to do everything myself. `` I used to be a singer. I still sing once in a while, in an emergency,'' said the 68-year-old <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, who toured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with regional opera companies as a tenor. `` Opera in those days was very bad, badly put together, and I always realized the lack of good theater in it. So when I had a chance to, I started teaching to earn some extra income. I realized how much I could give to it.'' Dubbed the `` two-penny opera'' in one newspaper account of the theater's history, the <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> seems to pride itself on making the most of less. His wife, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, helps wherever needed, from sewing costumes to singing last-minute roles. Props are inventive. Dry oatmeal was used once for snow, but discontinued when hordes of mice invaded. Sets are reused, carefully patched up so age does n't show The orchestra pit is literally that: a cramped, cellar-like area mostly under the stage with barely enough space for one upright piano and the usual accompaniment of 10 musicians. The concession stand is a small table in the back of the room, where <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>'s sister-in-law sells coffee and homemade rum balls and cookies When scenes call for front stage entrances, actors must race out the theater's back door, through the parking lot, past a varying assortment of vagrants, alcoholics and drug addicts and in through the theater's front door. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> moved his theater to the Bowery 29 years ago. `` Instead of having dope addicts, we had wine addicts,'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said. But there's been no trouble, and sometimes he invites his neighbors of the street in for a show. `` I say if you dress clean I'll let you come in, and they do. You'd be surprised the knowledge -LRB- of opera -RRB- some of them have, it's incredible,'' he said The contrast between the art form and the neighborhood is often startling. `` We're always running around with our costumes on. The bums, they stare at you and sometimes they think they have had too much to drink,'' <PERSON> Freiman </PERSON> said. `` Usually when you wear your costume no one says anything because it's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' But during one opera, which required tie and tails, several men asked <PERSON> Freiman </PERSON> for money because they thought he was rich. `` It was weird,'' <PERSON> Shicoff </PERSON> recalled. `` I would sing a performance down there and I would feel on top of the world and you would walk outside and somebody's laying in the gutter. It's a very strange dichotomy of emotions.'' Despite its humble stature, the <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> sometimes attracts opera critics from such publications as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, especially when it puts on operas not often performed elsewhere. The generally favorable reviews are plastered throughout the theater. `` Unlike some large opera companies, which dazzle the spectator initially but then sputter, the <LOCATION> Amato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s production pulls the listener in very gradually, gaining momentum as it progresses,'' wrote the Times' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> in a review of <PERSON> Offenbach </PERSON>'s `` Tales of Hoffman'' in 1986. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> used to have more grandiose aspirations than his spot on the Bowery. `` Years ago, I believe I had an ambition to get to the Metropolitan,'' he said. `` But not for the past 20 years, because I know I could do more here to help the young artists get ahead and learn the trade.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Reggae's Got Soul and Toots Hibbert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past decade, but <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> `` Toots'' <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> just keeps playing. <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON>, who has been making music since the early 1960s before the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his first LP since 1981, `` Toots in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>,' a collection of soul standards. His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been likened to the late <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, one of soul's greatest singers. The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, `` I've Got Dreams to Remember,'' and `` Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the rhythm' n' blues hit, `` Knock on Wood,'' and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s `` Love and Happiness.'' `` I always listened to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> said. `` We are related somewhat.'' Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist <PERSON> Teenie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, who helped write `` Love and Happiness,'' and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horns </ORGANIZATION>. Many of soul's greatest artists, including <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, recorded in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The idea for making an album there often had been suggested to <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON>, and the singer finally contacted <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> to express his interest. `` I'm not just a reggae singer,'' <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> explained. `` I can sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my style.'' Thanks to young artists such as <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON> and Maxi Priest, reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s. Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular are still around. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>, the music's most celebrated artist, died of cancer in 1980. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>'s onetime bandmate and a major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON>, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film, `` The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success. In the early'60s, <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> formed a ska trio, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION>,'' with <PERSON> Raleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON>. They quickly became one of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s most popular acts, with Prince <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> producing and <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> leading the way on a series of local hits, `` Pain in My Belly,'' `` Little Flea'' and `` Dog War.'' The group renamed itself the <ORGANIZATION> Maytals </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and won that year's Jamaican Festival Song competition with `` Bam, Bam. <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its name in a 1968 song, `` Do the Reggay.'' `` We were just playing around,'' <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> recalled. `` We used to have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not looking so great, ` She's like a streggae.' That word was there and one morning I said, ` Let's do the ` reggae.' I did n't think that the name would last.'' Under the production of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kong </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Maytals </ORGANIZATION> entered their peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae standards: `` Funky Kingston,'' `` 54-46 That's My Number'' and `` Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in `` The Harder They Come.'' But <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> was anxious to experiment with other forms of music, covering the rock' n' roll oldie `` <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louie </PERSON>,'' and a surprisingly danceable version of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>'s `` Take Me Home, Country Roads.'' <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> was surprised himself when he learned who performed the original song. `` When I listened to it first I thought it was <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and I always liked <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' sound,'' he said. `` I have a country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice anytime.'' Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>'s active support for Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> led to an assasination attempt in 1976 Priest and `` Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the late black nationalist leader, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ziggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>'s latest album has several political songs. But <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON>, who broke up with the <ORGANIZATION> Maytals </ORGANIZATION> in the early'80s, prefers to concentrate on personal matters. `` I do n't write about politics,'' the singer noted. `` I write about naturality, about real things that happen to real people.'' One of <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON>'s most popular songs is `` Love Is Gon na to Let Me Down,'' a heartfelt ballad. `` It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said. `` It can mean anybody, male or female. ` Everytime I see your face, something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love lets you down, love also never dies.'' He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a member of the Rastafarian religious sect. `` Reggae Got Soul'' is a better way of expressing <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON>'s philosophy. `` I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can sing it,'' he said. `` Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the music that carries love and good principles with it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Dying Son and a Difficult Book</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With 80 pages of his first novel completed, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> received some tragic news: His 3-year-old son, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, was dying of cancer. Feeling a `` huge rage at the injustice of it,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> divided time between the hospital and the typewriter, throwing himself into his work. The book he had started was hardly a sentimental love story. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> wanted to write about the troubles of a seemingly `` normal'' middle-class English family and decided to use the teen-age son's discovery of an affair between his father and sister as the central plot <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> had originally conceived a low-key approach but changed his mind after learning of his son's illness. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> died in January at age 5. `` It actually proved to be the perfect vehicle in a way to release my feelings, because it pushed me closer to the edge,'' explained <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, whose book is called `` The War Zone'' -LRB- $ 16.95, Doubleday -RRB-. `` I wanted to write a book which would explore incest without being too disturbing. The more I researched, the more I realized it's a very destructive process. I do n't think anybody could come out of it without being damaged. `` My son's illness allowed me do it head on, to try and take it all the way. I hope it's dangerous but in a responsible way. I hope it challenges what you think and feel, but at the same time feels true.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s wife was pregnant when the writer developed the idea for `` The War Zone.'' With <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> about to become a father, he became curious about the relationships between parents and children. `` I was very fascinated by friends and their fathers, and friends and their daughters and what seemed to be an electric spark. I would watch the daughters with their fathers, flirting with them and their friends. I wondered what it would be like to have a teen-age daughter.'' The book's narrator, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, is an alienated teen-ager enraged with his father and sister and cynical about the world in general. The 34-year-old <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> drew on his own disenchantment. `` I think it definitely comes out of something I felt at his age and now. He certainly does experience disillusionment. He's horrified by what his father is doing What interested me in <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s character was that whole area of exclusion All of us feel excluded at some time.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, born in 1955, grew up in the English town of <LOCATION> Bexley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>. His childhood had little of the trauma suffered by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> learned that several people from his supposedly quiet hometown eventually committed suicide. `` I do feel disillusioned in a sense. It's very hard to maintain in life the excitement you had at 12, 13 or 14. Why ca n't it be as wonderful as it seems to promise at that age? I suppose that's partly what the book's about. He did have a sister and remembered the shifting alliances when confronting their parents. `` We used to side against them at times. At other times you sort of chop each other to get out of something. Certainly, as a kid all of us have played our father against our mother,'' the author said. `` It seems to me the passions within the family are extraordinary to start with. The family is the environment in which you tend to develop your relationship skills, if you like. The book takes it one step further. He insisted, however, that the family portrayed in `` The War Zone'' was purely fictional. `` Both my parents read the book and are somewhat stunned by it. But at least they do n't recognize themselves in it. Obviously, one is influenced by one's childhood, but I did work hard in recreating something fictional from my own experiences and friends I had spoken to.'' Film, not writing, was <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s first love. The author wrote the screenplays for `` Ordeal by Innocence'' and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeg </PERSON>'s `` Insignificance,'' and sees similarities between the written word and moving pictures `` I was fascinated by visual language,'' he said. `` I do n't see it as a division. To me, it's all about using the language that's available The camera can be used emotionally, like <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorcese </PERSON>'s ` Mean Streets.' `` When I write I think in terms of the emotion I'd want if it were in a film, and than translate and get it onto the page.'' He was struggling financially while writing `` The War Zone,'' but was too distressed about his son to notice. `` I had a huge overdraft, a huge mortgage and was really kind of feeling worried financially,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said. `` But once he was ill the financial problems did n't matter, they became completely irrelevant. It does n't mean anything like seeing your son dying from cancer.''

 <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>'s life has had as many turmoils as a country music song lyric. She's had five marriages; her daughter, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, had meningitis as an infant; she's had medical and painkiller-dependency problems; her house burned; 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned in another fire; and she filed for bankruptcy last fall. A settlement was made in March, the bankruptcy is withdrawn and she's able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11. But <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> is n't trying to change her image as the country queen of hurt and lonely. `` It's often said I spoke for the wronged woman,'' she says. Her current single, `` Thank the Cowboy for the Ride,'' is cheerful. She is healthy and has been happily married, since 1978, to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, who manages her career. They met 22 years ago, when he was writing songs for her with record producer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON>, who gave her the stage name <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> to go with her middle name <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>. She was born <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>. `` I think that's one reason our marriage has been good and lasted,'' <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> says. `` We were buddies first. We worked well together. We could talk. `` When <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> and I got married, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherrill </PERSON> said, ` There will be no more sad songs written.' He was right.'' But she can still sing sad songs. `` I remember how I felt when I wrote the song or what was happening in my life when I first heard it and recorded it. I could n't get the feeling across to them -LRB- the audience -RRB- if I did n't go back and put myself in that position.'' She and <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> wrote only one song on her new album, `` When a Girl Becomes a Wife,'' for her youngest daughter, <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON>, who was married in March in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. Her older daughters are <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, who was married last year. <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON>'s new album, `` Next to You,'' her 51st for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, does contain some heartbroken and wronged-woman songs, such as `` You Left Memories Layin' -LRB- All Over the Place -RRB-'' and `` Liar's Roses.'' `` A sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life that has happened. You can feel part of that song,'' she said. She was interviewed while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for her first appearance at the Bottom Line. <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> is on a national tour these days. She tours 11 months a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and takes off three weeks in December. `` I've got a beautiful house in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and I live on a bus.'' The blond singer seems to glow with health. `` It feels good to feel good,'' she said. `` I have n't had any problems since surgery 2 -LCB- years ago. I had one operation and formed adhesions, which caused the rest of the operations. I'm one of those people who form scar tissue.'' About filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, protection against creditors, <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> said she and her husband had money in the development of two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shopping centers. The first sold and all went well. When the second sold, she said, the money was dispersed to the other partners and her bank credit was n't paid off. `` They sent a federal marshal to our house. They were going to take everything we had and we did n't owe the money,'' she said. `` I think they thought we would n't want my name dragged through fighting that. Whether they dragged my name through mud or not, we had to do it. They wanted $ 1.2 million. If you do n't owe it, why pay it? We'd worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody take it. We made a settlement of $ 450,000 in November and did n't get the paperwork done until March 9 We paid them and they're out of our life now.'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said three bankers were indicted in the case. `` We could n't explain this while we were in litigation,'' <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> said. `` I had to just say, yes, I'd filed for bankruptcy. It was horrible to have to go through it. You do n't think people will do that to you. It's over with. That's all that matters now.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, her husband's brother, and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who wrote `` Mamas, Do n't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,'' wrote the current single, `` Thank the Cowboy for the Ride.'' `` It's a cute little song,'' <PERSON> Wynette </PERSON> said. `` It starts, ` He was pushing 7 and I was barely 5, when he rode up on his broomstick horse and said, `` You want a ride?'' It goes on, ` He's almost 67; I admit to 39.' When I've done it on stage, old and young people love it.'' Her favorite song written with her husband is `` Till I Can Make It on My Own.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and I had just divorced. The song said exactly what I was living.'' She and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> worked together after the divorce but stopped that several years ago. `` He's happy. I'm happy. Our daughter is happy. We had magic years ago. To try and go back and recapture that would probably be a mistake. It's probably best we leave it like it is.''

<HEAD>Wildlife Experts Draft Conservation Blueprint For the 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ask <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> about his work, and he'll talk about marketing, the hard sell, tough choices and money _ just what you might expect from a sales executive or investment counselor <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON>, however, is a wildlife biologist and vice president for science of the World Wildlife Fund. He's talking about marketing conservation in countries where people struggle to find their next meal. He's deciding how to get the most from a limited pool of conservation dollars. His approach is a sign of a new discipline among conservationists as they try to sharpen the conservation blueprint for the 1990s. `` I think we've got the potential to find the resources to make conservation work,'' he said. `` We really have to make good conservation an element of good development.'' Other conservationists are thinking along similar lines. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> issued a report titled, `` The Crucial Decade: The 1990s and The Global Environmental Challenge.'' `` If efforts to save species and biological diversity are to succeed, a more coordinated, systematic and aggressive international effort is needed,'' the report said. `` The 1990s will be the crucial decade for action on these pressing concerns.'' Without a major effort, it said, `` irreparable damage will be done to the world's environment, and the problems will prove increasingly intractable, expensive and dominated by crises.'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> is trying to save endangered animals. Saving animals means saving habitat. The most carefully protected animals can not survive if they have no place to live. So much has been said about the loss of habitat that the mere recitation of statistics has lost its force. Each year, about 42,000 square miles of tropical forest are lost _ almost enough to cover the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It's anybody's guess how many plant and animal species are disappearing. In a report titled `` Biodiversity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> biologist E.O. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> tweaked the numbers and came up with this: Species are being lost 1,000 to 10,000 times as fast as they were before human beings arrived on the scene. `` By the turn of the century, much of the remaining tropical forest is going to be in isolated parks surrounded by development,'' said <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON>. `` There will be very few places where natural evolutionary processes continue, where traditional people continue to live traditional lifestyles.'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> and his colleagues have established three lines of attack to try to limit the damage: _ They've identified 10 `` threatened hot spots,'' small forested regions in immediate danger The hot spots cover two-tenths of 1 percent of the Earth's surface but harbor 27 percent of all tropical forest plant species. _ They've targeted 13 countries as `` megadiversity countries,'' for their unusually rich animal and plant life These countries contain at least 60 percent of the world's plant and animal species. _ And they've identified what they call major wilderness areas, the few places still mostly undisturbed where, if steps are taken soon, evolution can continue and traditional people can survive The `` threatened hot spots'' idea came from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the World Wildlife Fund. Without emergency aid, the 10 `` hot spots'' are likely to lose 90 percent of their forest cover within the next decade. That would mean losing almost 7 percent of the Earth's 5 million to 30 million plant and animal species. Apart from <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, the threatened hot spots are in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s are in the <LOCATION> Choco </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, the uplands of western <LOCATION> Amazonia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s are in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the eastern Himalayas. Many of the species in these areas have already been lost or will soon be lost, even if the areas are left untouched from now on, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. The rule of thumb is that for half of the species to survive, the remaining forest must cover at least 10 percent of its original range. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> says that is hardly ever the case. <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> developed the concept of megadiversity countries. `` As a marketing device, it's tremendously valuable,'' he said. It can be used in the megadiversity countries to excite the public about conservation. `` It's a source of national pride,'' he said. `` It tells them, in terms of natural resources, ` we're pretty special.' It's an effective way of selling conservation to them _ and to foundations.'' Because these countries contain at least 60 percent and perhaps even 80 percent of the world's species, they ought to get 60 percent or 70 percent of conservation funds, <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> has proposed. The countries are <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON>, whose research specialty is primates, said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> contain two-thirds of the world's primate species `` If we are n't successful in saving primate species in these countries, we're going to lose a major portion of the species,'' he said. `` We're not writing off the rest of the world. We're saying do something in every country on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But strategically, when we do our planning, these countries should get a major chunk of the interest, a major chunk of the investment.'' There is some good news in this story: <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> and company have identified five major wilderness areas that have a good chance of survival. `` These areas are not under immediate threat,'' he said. It wo n't require a large investment to save them. `` You just have to point out to the countries that this is something you should invest in for the future,'' he said. They are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, parts of upper <LOCATION> Amazonia </LOCATION>, and in a region that cuts across southern <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION>. The other bit of good news is that the <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> has served as manager of a task force on biodiversity, takes conservation seriously. The bank's mission traditionally has been to foster development in poor countries, which often put it in conflict with environmentalists. It made an important change in 1986 with the adoption of a wildlands policy. `` Wildlands can often contribute significantly to economic development,'' the bank said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is therefore to seek a balance between preserving the environmental values of the world's more important remaining wildlands and converting some of them to more intensive, shorter term use.'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> said conservationists should do two things to try to save remaining forests. The first is to expand the number and size of protected areas. But that has its limitations. `` They are expensive and will compose, at best, only five to 10 percent of the world's land area,'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> said. The second tactic is to encourage profitable use of the forests that does n't destroy them. Researchers recently found, for example, that harvesting latex, fruit and wood from a managed forest was three times as profitable as cutting it down to produce pulpwood or raise crops or cattle, <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> said. `` Development inevitably comes back to depending on natural resources,'' he said, `` and if you do n't use natural resources wisely, your development efforts and your global economy are eventually going to go down the tube.''

<HEAD>Microscopic Motors Tested at University of Utah Laboratory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB KUESTERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Microscopic motors the width of several human hairs are running at high speed at a university laboratory, where researchers believe they can drive tiny saws and drills or dispense medicine inside the human body. The devices, called wobble motors, have a tiny hair-like rod inside the wall of a shaft that runs on electrostatic force instead of the electromagnetic force used by regular motors. One wobble motor that has a diameter of 560 microns has made some 6 billion revolutions, said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Engineering Design. A micron is one millionth of a meter; a human hair is 80 microns thick; tests have started on a wobble motor 200 microns in diameter. Other labs have produced micro-electromechanical systems -LRB- MEMS -RRB- of about 100 microns, but the university's wobble motors are the first to operate for sustained periods _ more than three lifespans of car engines, said <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. The device is called a wobble motor because the armature wobbles slightly as it rolls around the inside of the motor. Since it rolls, instead of sliding as a normal armature turns, friction is greatly reduced, making it unnecessary to solve the problem of lubrication, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. Speeds of more than 120,000 wobbles per minute have been achieved by the motor, he said, and the researchers expect speeds of up to 500,000 wobbles per minute in the near future. The rotation produces high torque, which could be harnessed to tiny saws, knives, claws or other devices to grip, cut, twist or do other work in a controlled fashion. `` We've used it with a micro drill _ using a 0.002-inch bit,'' <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. The wobble motor marks a significant advance in the race with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and with several other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research institutions in developing MEMS, said <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. The potential of such devices is enormous, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. They could be used to operate tiny pumps that would dispense medication within the body. `` They could be put on the end of catheters,'' for removing deposits in arteries, `` and they can be used to make other small machines,'' he said. With their ability to go from full speed to zero in thousandths of a second, they also can be used to direct light beams. They have applications in scientific instruments, measuring devices, sensors, manipulation of biological materials, artificial limbs, display terminals, filters and in computer memory. Most of the MEMS are manufactured in the same way that ultra-thin circuits are etched in the production of computer microcircuit chips. The university's wobble motors are manufactured by a number of techniques, including extrusion of the motor under pressure. This microinjection molding is done at pressures up to 20,000 pounds per square inch. The technique offers the possibility of producing wobble motors resembling hair-thin spaghetti, cutting off as much as one needs. The university's project has been financed by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Work began six years ago at the university as an outgrowth of research on the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> artificial arm and the Utah-MIT dextrous hand, a robotic limb built to mimic the human hand. In addition to micromotors, the researchers also are developing microscopic actuators, sensors and other micro-system components.

<HEAD>Study Confirms Anti-Aging Effect on Skin, Finds Lower Doses Do Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The largest and longest study yet on the anti-aging effects of Retin-A confirms that the acne cream does smooth wrinkles, but reducing doses apparently reduces its effectiveness, researchers say. `` There is no question that the more you use, the more you improve,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` In those people who used the strongest doses, what we saw was a decrease in fine wrinkling, in roughness and in uneven coloring.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> found a year ago that Retin-A _ a synthetic form of Vitamin A known as tretinoin, long used to treat acne _ dramatically reduced the ravages of aging and sun damage in a short-term study of about 30 people. Since then, nationwide studies have been under way on how well it works and whether it is safe. The federal government has yet to approve it for this use, but it's available by prescription from physicians. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued a strong statement condemning indiscriminate use of Retin-A to treat wrinkles. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said there is no conclusive evidence the drug reduces wrinkles. `` Long-term animal studies and well-controlled clinical trials involving larger numbers of patients in various age groups are needed to assess the risks and benefits,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> study used a high dose of the drug and patients suffered significant known side effects of Retin-A, peeling, burning, redness and overall irritation of the skin. A six-month study of more than 300 patients last year at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> used lower and varying doses of the drug to learn whether side effects could be eased while still getting the positive anti-aging effects, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. Divided into four groups, the 300-plus patients used daily doses of Retin-A ranging from the highest tretinoin concentration of 0.05, to a moderate dose of 0.01, to a weak dose of 0.001, to a zero-dose in the placebo group. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> study used concentrations twice as high, at 0.10 strength. Nearly 90 percent of patients using the 0.05 dose showed at least some improvement, with half showing moderate to strong improvement, said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. Those using lower doses showed some effects of the Retin-A, but the results were much weaker and `` questionable,'' he said. The patients in the study were from 50 to 70 years old and were chosen because they showed moderate, not severe, signs of sun-damaged skin: mostly fine, but also some coarse wrinkling, also blotchy coloring and rough texture. All of these factors were visibly and statistically rated, as were the side effects. In addition, the length and depth of wrinkles were measured in plastic impressions, and skin biopsies were analyzed microscopically. Patients used the Retin-A daily, along with sunscreens and moisturizers. `` The biggest improvement was in the skin pigment, in evening out the skin's color and getting rid of blotches and brown spots,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` The next biggest improvment was in fine wrinkling _ the cross-hatches below the eye and in the crow's - After that, we saw improvement in texture _ in smoothing out rough skin.'' There was also some improvement in deeper, coarser wrinkles in some patients, but since that problem was not prevalent in most of the patients, it was difficult to measure that impact scientifically, he said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> also said the side effects of Retin-A were less than expected. `` Most people had mild to moderate side effects _ mostly peeling and some redness. By and large, the side effects were tolerated well. Usually, the effects would last a few days, then go away, then come back for a few days. After a few months, the skin seems to get used to the drug. Only three or four people had constant irritation, but nobody had any serious problems.'' So what is the best dosage of Retin-A to halt the ravages of time? `` I know this will sound like a cop-out,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> answered. `` But that is something that has to be determined between the patient and the doctor. People react differently to the stuff. The doctor has to assess your skin type. He will know when the irritation is too much, and if you are using enough to get good results. That is why Retin-A will remain a prescription drug for some time.''

On the first flight, a crystalline `` wafer'' of poor-quality gallium arsenide, heated and then evaporated in space, is expected to yield several thousand atomic layers of a much higher quality gallium arsenide. He said the materials have to potential to make semiconductors and superconductors that perform five or 10 times faster than current technology yet use up to 10 percent less power.

<NOTE>New Study Suggests Northwest Hit By `Recent' Quakes</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Studies of hearths and discarded seashells at old Indian sites suggest huge earthquakes struck the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> in the last 300 to 400 years, far more recently than previously believed, geologists say. Geologists Rick Minor and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> presented papers May 9 to a Geological Society of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> convention which correlate sudden, dramatic changes in land levels to disruptions of Indian communities. Previous evidence suggested the last major quake was 3,000 or more years ago, but <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and Minor said carbon dating of hearth sites and layers of shellfish eaten by coast dwellers show periods where habitation abruptly ended. These periods can be correlated to evidence of dramatic drops in land levels followed by a tsunami, a giant wave associated with large earthquakes, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. Scientists caution that carbon dating is imprecise and that the evidence, while intriguing, is circumstantial. Minor said Indian folklore contains no reference to the giant quakes, he speculated that diseases introduced by European settlers may have wiped out the tribes and their ancient oral traditions by the time ethnographers began studying the tribes in the early 1900s.

<NOTE>Scientists Track Genetic Trail to Bristlecone, The `Proto-Pine'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientists are learning to track the evolution of a species through genetic studies of conifers dating back to the oldest living plant _ the bristlecone pine. The bristlecone pine, which can live up to 4,000 years in rocky, cold terrain, is the oldest on earth and a common ancestor to all modern pine species, the scientists said they determined. `` With genetic techniques, we were able to figure out with a high degree of confidence which pine species evolved from which,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, an assistant professor of forest science. The bristlecone pine probably has been around for most of the 130 million years that pine trees are evident in the fossil record, and some alive today sprouted about 2,000 B.C., the scientists said. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a plant geneticist, is trying to engineer useful traits into the genetic makeup of conifers, like the pine. Eventually, it may be possible to create trees that grow faster, taller and more resistant to insects and disease.

<HEAD>Seattle Organization Introduces Modern Health Technology To Third
World</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A baby's birthweight is one of the first details of a new life that parents share with relatives. But in some Third World countries, that important detail often tells whether a newborn will live or die. And often that weight goes unknown because the baby is born at home and few birth attendants have accurate scales. The Program for Appropriate Technology in Health has developed a portable weighing mechanism, Birthweigh, that can be provided cheaply to poor countries. The scale has no numbers; it shows a square of blue if the baby is heavy enough _ over 2.5 kilos, or about 5.5 pounds _ to survive without special medical attention, and a yellow one if it is n't. <PERSON> Birthweigh </PERSON> is one of several health devices PATH has developed since it was established in 1976 as the Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology. The non-profit organizations, today known just as PATH, have sponsored more than 500 health programs in more than 30 nations, world, including birth control, immunization campaigns, and information for people who ca n't read. Family planning work led PIACT to realize that birth control was just a small part of what was needed to improve the lives of the Third World poor. This led to the creation of PATH in 1980. Birth control is still what PATH does most. It started condom production in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, prepared materials for vasectomy programs in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, and provided `` Copper-T'' interuterine devices to <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> women. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which provides 40 percent of PATH's funds, prohibits it from using money for abortion or abortion-related work. Other funds come from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Population Fund -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNFPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, private foundations, and foreign aid from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and other countries. The organization's annual budget is about $ 15 million. Few American babies die of diarrhea, but in poor countries that's not the case. PATH launched the sale in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and other countries of an inexpensive rehydration tablet that prevents babies from dehydrating to death.

 An unusually large surge in income tax payments helped produce a record $ 41.45 billion government budget surplus in April, three times the surplus posted in April 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The April surplus was fattened by a $ 68.53 billion bonanza in individual income tax receipts, up from the $ 53.33 billion collected in April 1988. It was the largest monthly surplus on record, surpassing the previous high of $ 38.9 billion posted in April 1987 and far ahead of last April's $ 13.77 billion surplus, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

 Policymakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in March voted to hold interest rates steady unless the slowing of economic growth proved inadequate to restrain inflation, according to minutes of the meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, noting early signs of a slackening in economic growth, voted 11-1 at its March 28 meeting to leave rates unchanged initially, it was disclosed Friday. But most members felt monetary policy `` should be adjusted more readily and promptly toward greater restraint than toward ease,'' the minutes said.

 The Fair Credit Reporting Act, enacted in 1971, gives Americans the right to know what's in their credit file and to challenge whatever information they believe to be inaccurate. If you're denied credit, you're entitled to know what's in your file within 30 days of receiving a rejection letter. That notice will contain the name and location of the credit-reporting bureau contacted in evaluating your file. At any other time, you can write to or visit the credit bureau to inspect your file for a nominal fee, usually between $ 5 and $ 10. The <ORGANIZATION> FCRA </ORGANIZATION> requires the bureau to help you if there's something in your file you do n't understand. The <ORGANIZATION> FCRA </ORGANIZATION> also allows access to your credit file by those authorized in writing, such as lenders to whom you are applying for credit, potential employers or insurers. Every time someone requests a copy of your report, it's noted as an `` inquiry'' on your credit file. You can dispute information in your file by providing evidence to prove an error or by insisting on an investigation. You can also submit statements to your file explaining why negative credit remarks were accumulated. Negative information can remain on your report for up to seven years, while bankruptcies are reported for 10 years.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, once intent on rushing to the rescue of savings and loan depositors, have paused to wage an ardent battle over a seemingly arcane accounting question. Should the savings and loan bailout be on-budget or off-budget? One side _ composed principally of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats _ wants to include bailout spending in the budget but give it a special exemption from the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, to avoid the law's automatic spending cuts in the overall budget. The other side _ the Republican administration _ is arguing for an off-budget plan that would borrow $ 50 billion for the bailout without counting it toward the deficit. A third variation _ pushed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats _ includes the spending in the budget but loads all of it into the 1989 fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That indirectly evades Gramm-Rudman because the deadlines that could have triggered spending cuts for this year already have expired. The terminology of the debate is obscure and the arguments confusing to nearly everyone but a government accountant. Occasionally the debaters throw in a jibe about dishonest accounting or the breakdown of budget discipline. To the taxpayer, it does n't seem to matter that much. All of the sides, after all, simply are proposing different ways of getting around the Gramm-Rudman law and no matter what plan is eventually adopted, the public ends up picking up most of the tab, upwards of $ 300 billion over 30 years. But to the debaters, it matters a lot. Congressional Democrats think their position is important enough to risk being blamed for delaying <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation and allowing the crisis to get worse. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is threatening to recommend a veto of any bill with on-budget financing, inviting Democrats to tag the administration with a similar obstructionist label. Publicly, the arguments run something like this. Democrats: Our plan is cheaper. It allows the government to borrow at a lower cost. And, it's more honest because all of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending will show up in the deficit. Republicans: Your plan destroys any spending discipline imposed by Gramm-Rudman. If adopted, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be tempted to evade Gramm-Rudman to pay for any costly problem and that threat will scare the financial markets into driving up all interest rates, negating any savings produced by the on-budget plan. But, the ardor of both sides has very little to do those arguments and very much to do with the constant dance of politics that surrounds the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> effort to avoid getting blamed for any future tax increase and the Democratic desire to block further spending cuts. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got elected to the presidency on his `` Read my lips, no new taxes'' pledge and <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would dearly love to force him to mouth different words. The administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached a relatively easy budget accord for 1990, avoiding both taxes and painful spending cuts. But that will become more difficult and the hardball will become harder as the 1992 election draws closer. Democrats know there's an advantage to their plan beyond any savings it might produce. Even with the threat of automatic spending cuts removed, an on-budget <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L plan would embarrass <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and increase the pressure on him to abandon his tax pledge. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal would add $ 50 billion to the 1989 deficit, ballooning it within range of the all-time record of $ 221 billion set in 1986. Not an auspicious start for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The House method, approved last Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, adds only about $ 10 billion to the 1989 deficit but it inflates 1990 red ink by about $ 25 billion and the 1991 budget gap by about $ 15 billion, destroying any hope of maintaining an illusion of progress on the deficit. The maneuvering between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration has deteriorated now into a game of chicken, with each side trying to blame the other for holding up the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue and hoping in the end that neither side will be willing to scuttle the rescue over the budget question. The next hurdle is the full House. Chances are good that an on-budget plan could pass there in early June. Then comes a conference committee between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> delegation will be led by <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., an on-budget advocate Assuming the conference committee approves an on-budget plan, one last and major hurdle remains. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have to separately approve any conference legislation. And, because the bill will by necessity change the 1989 budget adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must pass the funding part of it by 60 votes. There are 55 Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, so Democrats would have to hold all of their own votes and peel off five Republicans. Thus, it will likely fall to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to save the administration from having to choose between making good on its veto threat or publicly backing down.

 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has approved a sweetened $ 1.38 billion buyout bid from <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> more than a month after <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders turned down an earlier agreement with the rival poultry producer. But <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been trying to take over <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> since October, today extended its $ 63.50-a-share offer. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s tender offer will expire on Tuesday at 5 p.m. EDT. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said it had received tenders of about 8.9 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> common stock by the close of business Friday, which was the previous deadline. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s new $ 74.81-a-share stock swap proposal to acquire Memphis-based <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> is worth a total of $ 1.38 billion at current stock prices. That is significantly higher than a $ 1.1 billion proposal turned down at a <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders meeting April 14 and higher than <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s all-cash offer, which comes to $ 1.15 billion. Under the new agreement, each of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' 18.4 million outstanding shares would be exchanged for 2.1 <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> shares. <ORGANIZATION> Conagra </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 35.62 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday, meaning <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would receive stock worth $ 74.81 per share. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 62.62 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` We're not through trying to compete for the company,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s general counsel, said in an interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sunday. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would consider its options and see how investors react to the new agreement. He also noted that litigation connected with the takeover battle continues in courts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would await the outcome of the lawsuits before deciding what it would do. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> management has consistently shunned <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s bids, although they have been higher than previous ConAgra proposals. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> first bid for Holly Farms in November. After shareholderse rejected the deal with <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> reopened bidding. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has charged the auction process was unfair, and <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said Sunday his company was trying to `` find a way that we could compete on a level playing field and compete fairly.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge last week agreed that the bidding procedures were unfair to <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, Ark.-based <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, but said there were no legal grounds to halt the auction. Under the previous <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms-ConAgra </PERSON> agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> certain of its assets if the proposed buyout fell through. However, the agreement approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board late Saturday night removed that provision, known as a `` lock-up'' agreement. The newest offer is subject to approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, which were lobbied heavily by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> before the last vote. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the company hoped to have another shareholder vote by the end of July. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the new agreement also allows <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> to terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> a fee of $ 15 million plus actual expenses if the agreement fails. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has objected to that fee agreement. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were being forced to vote for the agreement, or have millions of dollars taken away from the firm.

Eastern had signed a tentative agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> to lease the jets for $ 96.6 million over five years. Eastern has announced similar agreements with other carriers in recent weeks, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> deal was the first approved by the bankruptcy court. Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a paralyzing strike by its Machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight attendants. The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> or any of its assets, including the shuttle service. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said last week there were no `` real live offers'' to buy the entire carrier. He challenged the prospective suitors to risk at least $ 100 million of their own cash for any purchase. Two investor groups, one headed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> and the other led by former <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, have submitted formal bids. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> may try to use the state's $ 17 billion pension fund to back a buyout by the <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> or Howard group, in an effort to protect jobs provided by the airline, according to newspaper reports Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that a state investment of at least $ 50 million was being considered, given the proper guarantees against loss. At the time the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employed about 30,000 workers, including 12,000 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, meanwhile, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had provided valid reasons for its plan to sell the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington-Boston </ORGANIZATION> shuttle. Eastern already has an agreement to sell the shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million, but last week <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> gave the airline until today to consider a higher bid by <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, the attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors, said they supported a prompt sale of the shuttle. The growing likelihood of a shuttle sale, coupled with the apparent lack of sufficient buyout offers for the whole airline, bolster <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed plan to cut its size and sell another $ 1.4 billion or so in assets separately, some observers believe. Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay $ 415 million for the shuttle and $ 336 million for 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s in a total package worth $ 751 million. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expires May 27. Under their contract, the developer would receive $ 8 million from Eastern if the shuttle deal collapses. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has said it would not employ <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers if it purchased the shuttle, while <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions as representatives for employees of his shuttle. On Thursday, pilots union leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> reversed their earlier position and said 170 Eastern pilots could work for the shuttle if it is sold to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Warner Says Pact With Shareholder Clears Path for Merger with Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it settled a longstanding dispute with its largest shareholder, clearing another potential obstacle to the entertainment company's planned $ 18 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, joined <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in announcing the settlement that the companies said would permit the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to proceed `` without any delay or adjustment.'' The merger would create the world's largest media and entertainment concern, with $ 10 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Chris-Craft had entered an agreement in 1984 in which they acquired stakes in each other in what was seen as a defensive manuever by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to avoid a hostile takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> bought about 42.5 percent of Chris-Craft's broadcasting subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> bought a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> that now amounts to about 17 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> agreed to refrain from acquiring a television station or making make certain changes in control while the pact with Chris-Craft was in effect. But in the years since the pact was signed, relations soured between <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and Chris-Craft and there was some concern it could delay the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger with Time. Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> sued Chris-Craft, seeking an order that would have compelled Chris-Craft to resolve any objections to the merger. That litigation was resolved under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. Under the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it will offer to sell its shares in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> to third parties. Chris-Craft would have the right of first refusal to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> or require <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to spin off its interest in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders after the merger. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is ending its right of first refusal on the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares held by Chris-Craft as part of the agreement. `` We are delighted that despite our earlier differences, the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> WCI </ORGANIZATION> and Chris-Craft is ending on a constructive and amicable basis and in the best interests of all the shareholders and the concerned parties,'' the chairmen and chief executives of both companies, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> of Chris-Craft, said in a joint statement. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was quoted as saying `` <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> will be the premier media and entertainment company in the world, and I wish it well.'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was said to be unavailable for comment. Upon the merger, <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> will be <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, owning about 11 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock.

 Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with the drop in prices based largely on weather factors. There was precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 6 - to 10-day forecast starting Thursday calls for normal or above-normal rainfall for most areas The strong dollar also was a drag on the market. Most affected are soybeans futures.

Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s announcement over the weekend that he may allow farmer-owned grain reserves to come to market this summer and fall caused only a minor stir among corn futures traders. `` If it were not for other news it would have been a major factor on the market,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouba </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 The stock market levelled off today, pausing to test the winds at its highest levels in more than a year and a half. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which broke 2,500 on Friday for the first time since the 1987 crash, slipped back 4.03 to 2,497.07 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 724 up, 620 down and 511 unchanged. The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets today. That prompted strength in the American credit markets. Prices of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, gained as much as $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value. That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean less competition for stocks from interest-bearing securities. In addition, analysts say, they reduce the perceived chances that the economy will have to go through a recession. But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in its rally since last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038. They said some traders moved today to cash in on those gains. <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -LCB- to 33 -RCB- on conjecture that the company, which recently fended off a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, might become a target for other offers. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced a new high-power desktop personal computer, climbed 2 ~ to 86 <ORGANIZATION> Competitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 \ to 109 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .19 to 179.11.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies At Higher Level After Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with central bank intervention.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar steadied at higher levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> late Monday after central banks intervened to push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower. Gold prices fell as much as $ 6.50 an ounce in morning trading. The dollar surged in the first hour of European trading and continued to gain momentum as it broke through several important resistance points. After peaking in midday dealings, the dollar settled in a fairly narrow range before a wave of central bank intervention pushed the currency lower late in the session. With the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> reportedly intervening in concert with several major European central banks, the dollar slipped temporarily back toward the end of the day, but quickly recouped some of its losses. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, following its recent pattern, abstained from the intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it participated in a concerted effort to push the dollar lower as did the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgium </ORGANIZATION>. The British and Swiss central banks also participated, dealers said. But dealers said they expected the impact of the dollar sales to be fleeting. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, one trader attributed Monday's surge to panic-buying based on the market's perception that the Group of Seven industrialized nations can not agree on policies to stabilize currency rates. `` The market is very violent and rather irrational,'' said another trader. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.5815 late in the afternoon, compared with $ 1.5750 at midmorning and $ 1.6190 late Friday. Other dollar rates at late afternoon, compared with late rates on Friday, and with midmorning rates in parentheses included: 2.0075 -LRB- 2.0135 -RRB- West German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7925 -LRB- 1.7985 -RRB- Swiss francs, up from 1.7583; 6.7895 -LRB- 6.8140 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, up from 6.6700; 2.2640 -LRB- 2.2598 -RRB- Dutch guilders, up from 2.2210; 1,455.75 -LRB- 1,462.50 -RRB- Italian lire, up from 1,435.00; and, 1.1955 -LRB- 1.1935 -RRB- Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose despite sizeable <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.55 yen. The dollar's rise hit precious metals sharply. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 361.80 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 365.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 359.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price for gold was $ 360 compared with $ 365.25 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 6.01 to close at a bid of $ 361.21. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.07 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 5.35.

<HEAD>New Words For Old Hymns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ideology is not rigid. It is not dogma. Sooner or later it must accommodate reality, a process seldom undertaken without difficulty and controversy. That observation was made several years ago by Prof. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> in `` The American Disease,'' a book about the transformation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> capitalism, but it fits neatly with what is occurring in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Values may persist from generation to generation, but ideology must accommodate change, <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> said. Sometimes it does n't; outmoded ideology tends to linger, while people and institutions depart from it in pragmatic ways. `` Eventually, we can no longer practice what we preach, and we are not yet able to preach what we practice,'' said <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, who teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The result: An ideological schizophrenia. New practices bring forth a new ideology to justify itself, but loyalty to old ways discourages articulation. A legitimacy gap develops. The old hymns are still sung, but practices change. As the gap widens, two conflicting pressures converge, one seeking to force errant institutions back into conformity with the old theology and the other seeking more forceful expression of the new ideology. What <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the entire socialist world are experiencing is probably nothing new when viewed in this context, except perhaps in the sharpness of the convergence. How do you erect monuments to <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and ignore him too? Lodge's book, written in 1984, was an attempt to describe how the two great political ideologies of individualism and communitarianism interact in a changing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, one that casually identifies itself as capitalistic. But, as he and others have pointed out, raw individualism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been muted by the necessities of community interests, and now in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other socialist nations, individualism forces communism to evolve. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, change was anticipated and institutions erected to make change peaceful. And in a century of slow but constant change, capitalism has evolved into something vastly different from what it was. Thirty-eight years ago, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, editor of `` This Week'' magazine, wrote an article called `` Wanted: A New Name for ` Capitalism.''' He felt that in too many people's minds, especially the minds of foreigners, `` it stand for the primitive economic system of the nineteenth century.'' How, he asked, shall we describe this system _ `` imperfect, but always improving, and always capable of further improvement _ where men move forward together, working together, building together, producing always more and more and sharing together the rewards of their increased production?'' As told by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> in his social history, `` The Big Change,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> had heard various suggestions, such as `` the new capitalism'' or `` democratic capitalism,'' `` economic democracy,'' `` industrial democracy,'' `` distributism,'' `` mutualism,'' and `` productivism.'' Could there be a more descriptive name, he wondered, and so he asked his readers. He got 15,000 responses. `` Never in my whole editorial experience,'' said <PERSON> Nichol </PERSON>, `` have I touched so live a nerve.'' But, just as a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> experimenting with individualism may continue to sing the hymns of communism, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still referred to as capitalist <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The White House, in an apparent coordinated effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, today moved to try to halt the surge of the dollar's value abroad, declaring that a further rise could `` undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.'' The statement, the first time the White House has commented directly on the dollar since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office, appeared to be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in international currency markets, traders and analysts said. And it followed hectic trading in European markets, during which the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and counterpart central banks of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other European nations reportedly were making heavy sales of dollars. Selling dollars can help to drive their price down against other major currencies. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began selling off dollars `` about the time of the statement. It was calculated to have a combined impact. Unfortunately, the market is shrugging it off.'' Today's White House statement was clearly designed to invite international action to halt the dollar's rise, apparently including heavier intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks to stabilize the currency. A statement read by deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said the climbing dollar `` is a matter of concern'' that `` has also prompted questioning of the administration's commitment to the process of economic policy coordination'' among the Group of Seven major industrial democracies. It was a reference to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, who have jointly vowed to take concerted efforts to stabilize currencies through a variety of steps, including direct intervention in exchange markets by central banks and adjustments in interest rates. `` The administration remains fully committed to this process. If the dollar's recent rise against other major currencies is sustained for a prolonged period or extended, it could undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances,'' the White House statement said. `` Accordingly, we will continue our efforts to strengthen underlying policies that promote the adjustment of external imbalances as well as cooperating in exchange markets as agreed'' by the seven nations, the statement said. Although the statement appeared to represent an administration call for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks to do more to stabilize the dollar, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> refused to elaborate on it, claiming its spoke for itself. `` The president and the secretary of the treasury remain the administration's sole spokesmen on the dollar and exchange rate policy,'' he said. The dollar's surge against other major currencies has threatened to undue recent improvements in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes imported good less expensive in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, aggravating the deficit. Recent intervention by central banks _ buying and selling of dollars directly _ has failed to stem the rise of the currency. Even an increase in a key interest rate last month by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank _ a move that would usually help weaken the dollar _ failed to have much impact on the dollar's rise.

 Share prices plunged on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, amid heightened fears that European interest rates might have to rise to halt the dollar's latest surge. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 35.7 points, or 1.6 percent, lower at 2,169.0, after losing as much as 41.1 points in the afternoon. At its best, the index was up 5 points at the opening. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index closed 33.9 points lower at 1,803.6. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 19.04 points to finish at 1,233.20. Volume was moderate, with 614.4 million shares changing hands, down from Friday's 856.8 million shares. Besides the interest rate worries, dealers and analysts agreed that the market's strong advance last week, which added 69 points to the 100-share index, was based more on hope than economic fundamentals. Touching off Monday's plunge was the dollar's rise above 2 West German marks. This in turn boosted British money market interest rates, as market participants reasoned that only rate hikes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be sufficient to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's strength

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Well Above 2 Marks in Europe, Gold Falls Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar surged in hectic European trading Monday, but ended well below its session peaks as profit-taking slowed the currency's rapid advance. Heavy, repeated, central-bank intervention had little impact, dealers said. Gold prices, hurt by the strong dollar, fell more than $ 5 an ounce. The dollar pushed through the 2-West German mark level early in the European day, for the first time since December 1986. That prompted a wave of new buying that took the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency up to a session high of around 2.0190 marks. The dollar rose nearly 4 cents against the British pound and more than 3 yen. Heavy overnight intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, which some dealers estimated sold $ 1.5 billion for yen, had little impact on the dollar's strength, as did intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and European central banks later in the day, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> came in a second time in the afternoon, again with little impact, they said. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> reportedly intervened four times, with the first round apparently the heaviest, dealers said. Dealers attributed the dollar's move below its peaks to profit-taking rather than the impact of intervention. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to its highest level since August 1987. It cost $ 1.5810 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6190 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday: 2.0088 West German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7922 Swiss francs, up from 1.7583; 6.7990 French francs, up from 6.6700; 2.2640 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2210; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,435.00; and 1.1956 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose despite sizeable <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.05 yen. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 360.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 365.75. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 359.80 an ounce, compared with $ 365.25 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 6.01 to close at a bid $ 361.21 an ounce. Silver prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.14 a troy ounce from $ 5.35 Friday.

 Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as investors reacted to weather forecasts and the continued rise in the value of the dollar. There was precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas that were suffering from dryness.

Adding to the market's woes is the strength of the dollar, which analysts say is likely to curtail export of grains. Particularly affected by the rising dollar are soybean futures. Foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans has dropped with the dollar's rise, with some countries turning to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for their supplies `` The momentum in the market is on the down side,'' <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said, adding that despite the low prices, no one is coming in to buy. `` There is a real deflationary sentiment in all the markets.''

<HEAD>Brady Says Dollar Investments Against Backdrop of Unsettling Events</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Dollar-Gold Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 International turmoil that has sparked demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as a safe investment haven is a key factor in the currency's recent surge in foreign exchange, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Monday. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said massive buying that pushed the dollar to a 19-month high Monday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> had to be viewed in terms of world unrest. `` You have a million Chinese rioting in the streets,'' he said. `` You have <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in an unsettled state of affairs. You have, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, lack of clear definition of leadership really for the first time since the second World War. So it does n't surprise me that people pause for a moment and want to put their money in a country where the people have settled their leadership question.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> mainly to speak to about 750 business people and educators at the Baird-Manegold Lecture Series at the Pfister Hotel, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The dollar has soared in foreign exchange during recent weeks despite waves of dollar-selling for government central banks. The dollar on Monday traded at levels not seen since December 1986 against the West German mark and since October 1987 against the Japanese yen. The White House on Monday, in an apparent coordinated effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declaring that a further rise could `` undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.'' The statement, the first time the White House has commented directly on the dollar since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office, appeared to be tied to a late-morning selloff of dollars by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in international currency markets, traders and analysts said. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also indicated that recent jumps in inflation stemmed partly from one-time factors such as higher energy prices due to the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill and higher food prices caused by last year's drought `` The figures I look at, without energy and food, are pretty calm,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. In remarks prepared for the luncheon, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to sustain and strengthen its position as a world economic leader in the next century, the government must play a role in coordinating economic policies with major trading partners, in working to abolish barriers to free trade and in reducing the cost of capital to corporations. Efforts to coordinate economic policies with trading partners helped reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit last year by $ 34 billion to about $ 127 billion, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stated.

<HEAD>Dollar Rally Persists, Overwhelms Central Bankers Again</HEAD>

 The dollar surged Monday, smashing the 2-mark level for the first time in 2 -LCB- years and hitting a 1 -LCB- - year high vs. the yen despite repeated central-bank selling and a White House plea to depress the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency The rally eased interest rates in the credit markets and helped cause a huge drop in commodity prices. Gold in particular was hurt, falling $ 3 to a late bid of $ 364.50 a troy ounce, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported. The White House issued a statement on the dollar, its first since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office, warning that a further increase in the currency could `` undermine international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.'' The statement was in conjuction with repeated dollar-selling efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and several European central banks. The dollar eased slightly from its highest levels, but currency analysts attributed that to speculators cashing profits on the dollar's persistent rally. Currency analysts said the market perceives weakness between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its six key trading partners, known as the Group of Seven, in foreign-exchange policies, despite official statements to the contrary. Dealers said that was a key element behind the dollar's strong gains Monday. Supporting that sentiment was a story in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that said some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would prefer to rely less heavily on intervention and shift to a more flexible dollar policy. In addition, West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said in an interview with the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> he thought recent interventions have proven ineffective and that his country could live with the firmer dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> was conspiciously absent from Monday's intervention. `` The market seems to be focusing on disarray in the G-7,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a currency analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. However, some analysts contend there's little the G-7 can do right now to re-direct the dollar, unless major economic policy changes are made. `` I think they -LRB- G-7 officials -RRB- are encountering a situation not unlike the situation confronting the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They have this huge public sentiment out there that is being expressed in ways not to their liking but there's not much they can do about it.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could depress the dollar by easing credit policies, but that could undermine its inflation-fighting efforts, analysts said. High <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, in comparison to those overseas, make investments like bonds more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need to convert their currencies to dollars. Also supporting the dollar are growing inflation abroad and political uncertainty in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, analysts said. The unrest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also was having a positive effect on the dollar, they said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar soared despite sizeable <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first time the dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. It was quoted at 142.05 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and 142.05 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 139.05 Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to its highest level since August 1987. It cost $ 1.5810 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6190 late Friday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5755 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.6120. The dollar also pushed through the 2-West German mark level for the first time since December 1986. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Friday, included: 2.01175 West German marks, up from 1.9770; 1.7935 Swiss francs, up from 1.7635; 1.20125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19115; 6.8115 French francs, up from 6.6905; and 1,456.50 Italian lire, up from 1,439.00. Dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Friday: 2.0088 West German marks, up from 1.1995; 1.7922 Swiss francs, up from 1.7583; 6.7990 French francs, up from 6.6700; 2.2640 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2210; 1,455.75 Italian lire, up from 1,435.00; and 1.1956 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1911. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 363.20 a troy ounce from $ 365.70 Friday.

Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 833 up, 695 down and 486 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 185.01 million shares, down from 242.41 million Friday, when the total was inflated by program trading linked to expiring options and stock index futures. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 222.25 million shares. The dollar rose sharply in world currency markets Monday. That prompted strength in the American credit markets. Prices of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, gained as much as $ 10 for each $ 1,000 in face value. That all was seen as positive for stocks. Falling rates mean less competition for stocks from interest-bearing securities. In addition, analysts say, they reduce the perceived chances that the economy will have to go through a recession. But brokers also noted that the market has come a long way in its rally since last November, when the Dow got as low as 2,038. They said some traders moved today to cash in on those gains. Avon Products led the active list and rose 2 -RRB- to 34 | on conjecture that the company, which recently fended off a takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, might become a target for other offers <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced a new high-power desktop personal computer, climbed 3 -LRB- to 87 -LRB-. International Business Machines, faced with that competitive development, dropped 1 \ to 109 American Family fell 1 to 16. The company said it was looking for second-quarter operating earnings per share to be flat with the comparable period last year, and projected lower results for the full year than analysts had been estimating. Precious metals issues were conspicuously weak, with prices of gold and other commodities falling. <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> dropped ~ to 11 and Freeport-McMoRan Gold -LCB- to 10 -RRB-. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 4.28 billion, or 0.14 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained .42 to 179.34. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .33 to 369.09, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .74 at 321.98 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market slipped .27 to 441.78.

 Petroleum futures prices finished mostly lower in moderate trading Monday amid OPEC-related concerns. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a last-minute buying binge drove the June contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, to $ 20.93, up 33 cents from Friday's close. The June contract, which traded as low as $ 20.10 during the session, expired at the close of trading. Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later in the year were down across the board. Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for delivery in June fell 1.29 cents to 63.90 cents a gallon, while June heating oil fell 1.08 cents to 46.98 cents a gallon. Other contracts also closed the session lower. Analysts said worries about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> dominated trading in the crude market ahead of the cartel's planned June 5 meeting. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said lower crude prices reflected concerns that various members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are producing above their self-imposed output quotas. An unconfirmed report that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would increase production unilaterally if the cartel did n't agree to raise its target level sparked some early selling, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. `` The reports said that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was willing to flood the market or increase production because it wants an increase in its quota,'' he said. Another report that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> would ask for a $ 15 a barrel floor on crude prices at the June meeting also fueled selling activity, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, energy analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's just pre-meeting posturing, just a negotiating tactic,'' said <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, `` but the Saudi statement moved the market.'' Energy brokers said the continued slide in gasoline futures reflected traders' concern that the market was overbought and that product inventories remained higher than last year.

 Grain and soybean futures prices dropped sharply Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting investor reaction to wet-weather forecasts and the relentless rise in the dollar's value. On other markets, precious metals continued their slide, copper fell sharply; livestock and meat prices were mixed and energy futures were off. Grain and soybean prices dropped largely in reaction to to precipitation during the weekend in major crop areas and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 6 - to 10-day forecast starting Thursday that calls for normal or above-normal rainfall for most areas Wheat settled 6 cents to 7 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.94 \ a bushel; corn was 5 -RCB- cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.66 a bushel; oats were 7 -RCB- cents to 9 \ cents lower with July at $ 1.75 a bushel; soybeans were 25 -LCB- cents to 28 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 6.93 `` There were a lot of fund and commission sells,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` After the initial drop at the opening, trading was in a narrow range. But the sentiment was so negative, we could n't mount a rally.'' Adding to the market's woes was the strength of the dollar, which analysts say is likely to curtail export of grains. Particularly affected by the rising dollar are soybeans futures. Foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans has dropped with the dollar's rise, with some countries turning to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for their supplies `` The momentum in the market is on the down side,'' <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said, adding that despite the low prices, no one is coming in to buy. `` There is a real deflationary sentiment in all the markets.'' Gold and silver continued their slide on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` There nothing new to say about them,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They remain under pressure from the dollar.'' The dollar's increasing attractiveness has caused many investors to sell their positions in gold and silver. Gold was $ 2.90 to $ 5.40 lower with June at $ 363.70 a troy ounce; silver was 12.3 cents to 15.8 cents lower with May at $ 5.106 a troy ounce. Copper weakened on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, partly because of excessive supplies, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` Copper has been on a down trend for the past few weeks,'' he said. `` Today's close was very negative, adding another level of technical weakness to the market.'' Copper was 3.25 cents to 6.65 cents lower with May at $ 1.113 a pound. Livestock prices were mixed, and pork futures fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Frozen pork bellies prices dropped because of uncertainty over the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly report on the amount of bellies in storage. But the number, released after the close of trading, was lower than expected at 145.3 million pounds. Live hog futures rose on word of higher cash prices. Feeder cattle prices rose in the wake of sharply lower grain futures and the possibility of less expensive feed grain in the future. Live cattle prices were lower due a weak cash market. Live cattle were .28 cent to .65 cent lower with June at 70.42 a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .40 cent higher with May at 77 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .33 cent higher with June at 49.05 cents a pound; pork bellies were 1.20 cents to 1.45 cents lower with May at 34.80 cents a pound. Energy futures were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 13 cents lower to 33 cents higher with June at $ 20.93 a barrel; heating oil was 1.07 cents to 1.14 cents lower with June at 46.98 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.01 cents to 1.46 cents lower with June at 63.90 a gallon.

<HEAD>Army To Give Beretta Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it would award its next major handgun contract to the Italian arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION>, saying a congressionally ordered repeat competition had not produced a better candidate. The service, in a prepared statement, said only two gunmakers had taken advantage of the congressional order to enter 9mm guns in the new competition _ <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ruger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Southport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` The performance of the <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M9 </ORGANIZATION> pistol was significantly better than either of the competing weapons,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said in summarizing the results. `` During the testing, both of the other candidate weapons failed some of the mandatory requirements.'' Beretta's victory means the company is in line for an immediate contract option order for almost 57,000 pistols worth $ 9.9 million. That order will bring to almost 378,000 the number of pistols ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Over the next several years, however, new orders are expected to swell the orders to more than 500,000 total, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Assuming congressional leaders accept the test results, Monday's announcement would end a five-year battle over the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to turn to a foreign company for the handgun that is replacing the venerable Colt .45 pistol Testing of replacements began in 1984. Of the original eight competitors, four were eliminated _ including <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> _ and two others withdrew. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> then selected Beretta for the work in April 1985, touching off protests from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which operates a manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Armi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation, in particular, went to bat for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> and in 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> it would have to stage a new competition before awarding additional contracts. The Army grudgingly complied, issuing a request for interested bidders in May 1988. As the competition began, the prospects of another winner appeared to improve for a time because of well-publicized problems with cracking metal slides on the Beretta pistol. But Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said `` the demonstrated performance'' of the Beretta pistol during the competition `` and the failure of the two other candidates to meet the minimum performance requirements'' made its choice easy. The service refused to spell out which standards the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruger </PERSON> pistols had failed to meet. But the guns were being measured on everything from the design of the magazine and trigger guard to corrosion protection; accuracy; reliability; firing pin energy; safety mechanisms, and ability to withstand various climatic conditions.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> extended its $ 63.50 a share tender offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and then filed suit to block the company's latest deal with rival suitor <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under a new agreement announced Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, would acquire Memphis-based <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 74.81-a-share stock swap that values the company at about $ 1.38 billion. The bid tops the $ 1.1 billion <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> agreement that <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders rejected April 14 and the current all cash offer from <LOCATION> Springdale-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION>, which values <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> at about $ 1.15 billion. Tyson extended its offer until 5 p.m. Tuesday. Under the proposed ConAgra-Holly Farms agreement, each of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' 18.4 million outstanding shares would be exchanged for 2.1 <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> shares. <ORGANIZATION> Conagra </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 33.62 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Monday, down from $ 2. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 67.12 -LCB- a share, up $ 4.50. Tyson chief counsel <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said Monday that the new <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreement with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> was unfair and his company filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to block it. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the suit asks the court to block <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> from completing any merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> `` until such time as all the impediments that now keep us from now being able to compete on a fair and equal basis are eliminated.'' <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> has been rebuffing <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> takeover proposals since last October. After shareholders rejected its initial deal with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> reopened bidding for the compan by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has claimed the auction process was unfair. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge agreed that the bidding procedures were unfair to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> but said there were no legal grounds to halt the auction. In a news release Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said he was surprised that <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' proceeded with the auction process over the weekend, considering the judge's criticism of the process. `` We are considering all of our alternatives and have not made any decisions as to what we will do,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. Under the previous <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms-ConAgra </PERSON> agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> certain prize assets if the proposed buyout fell through. However, the agreement approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board late Saturday night removed that provision, known as a `` lockup'' agreement. The newest offer is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the company hoped to have another shareholder vote by the end of July. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the new agreement also allows <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> to terminate the deal if it receives a higher offer. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> a fee of $ 15 million plus actual expenses if the latest agreement falls through.

 The publishers of <ORGANIZATION> Entrepreneur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> said Monday they intend to begin publishing a magazine designed for women who are starting their own businesses. The magazine will be called Entrepreneurial Woman which will debut with an issue in June and appear once every two months starting in February. `` This is a business magazine for women,'' said <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Thain </PERSON>, publisher and president of the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based magazine concern. `` There is a great distinction between this magazine and publications like Working Woman and Savvy, which are lifestyle magazines for women who work.'' The magazine will provide practical advice on how to start a business and keep it running, much as the magazine Entrepreneur has provided. But <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> said Entrepreneurial Woman will consistently address issues of relevance to women, such as how to obtain financing and how to balance business with family responsibilities as well as stories on women role models. The first issue, for instance, has stories on cars suited to women's entreprenuerial lifestyles, the prospects for the infant-products industry and the only woman to run a record label. <PERSON> Thain </PERSON> said he is convinced there is a market for such a magazine because one in four subscribers to Entrepreneur are women and government statistics indicate four out of five new business owners are women. He said his two magazines will not carry the same stories and as a result should not dilute the original magazine's circulation. Entrepreneur has a circulation rate base of 300,000 effective in July. Entrepreneurial Woman will have a rate base of 200,000.

 A surge in the dollar and an improved outlook for inflation propelled bond prices sharply higher and drove interest rates downward Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond was up 13-16 point, or nearly $ 12 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.59 percent, the lowest closing yield since March 1988, and was down from 8.70 percent on Friday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. The dollar broke an important psychological barrier, 2 West German marks, and hit a 1 -LCB- - year high against the Japanese yen despite repeated intervention by central banks and a plea from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to depress the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency The dollar's surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodity prices, and that in turn increased bond traders' hopes that inflation would slow down and the economy would cool off, analysts said. When the economy is slow, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is less likely to tighten credit, which raises interest rates and sends bond prices lower. <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said money that had flowed out of bonds as interest rates rose was changing direction and moving back into <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities. `` People are realizng the economy is slowing down,'' he said. `` People are underinvested in bonds.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> McCarthy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a money market research firm, said he expected bond prices to continue to move higher because `` There's a lot of people who want to get on the bandwagon.'' `` We've probably seen the high -LRB- interest -RRB- rates for this business cycle,'' he said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term governments were up between 3-16 point and 5-16 point, intermediate maturities were up between -RRB- point and 13-16 point and long-term issues advanced ~ point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, jumped 6.40 to 1,154.97. In corporate trading, industrials also were higher. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained 1.86 to 314.01 In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 13-32 point. The average yield to maturity fell to 7.41 percent from 7.44 percent late Friday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, slipped to 8.60 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 8.32 percent. Yields on six-month bills dropped to 8.76 percent as the discount fell 7 basis points to 8.30 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.76 as the discount declined 9 basis points to 8.13 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 911-16 percent, up from 9 | percent on Friday

 Condominiums, shopping malls and office buildings may go on the block as the government disposes of assets from failing savings and loans, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said Monday The agency eventually could control between $ 300 billion and $ 500 billion in failing thrifts' assets and sell off between $ 50 billion and $ 100 billion in non-performing assets, such as repossessed property, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said.

Taxpayers will pay most of the cost of the bailout plan, which involves closing or merging more than 500 failed institutions. `` What the government did was hand its credit card to a bunch of institutions and said, ` Here, you can borrow on our credit' _ that's what deposit insurance is,'' he said. `` Now that the people who lent them the money want the money back, the government either pays it or the deposit insurance system fails. `` Since the government ca n't allow the deposit insurance system to fail, the taxpayers will have to pay.'' Under the plan introduced in February, 219 insolvent S & amp; Ls have been placed under <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> conservatorship and another 60 have been targeted for takeover by the agency, which will guarantee depositors' assets.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Sharply Higher, Share Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar opened sharply higher against the Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> plunged. The dollar started trading at 142.05 yen, up 1.60 yen from Monday's close of 140.45 yen. It was the highest opening since Oct. 27, 1987, when the currency opened at 142.10 yen. Traders said the currency's jump in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed its overnight gain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The dollar started remarkably higher but trading is quiet right now,'' said a trader with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Buying and selling of the currency has been mixed so far in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.'' He said speculative investors' dollar-buying has resulted in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit's recent surge. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly intervened in the market to halt the dollar's further rise. The central bank does not inform the public of its monetary activities. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 65.9 points the previous day, quickly lost 319.99 points, or 0.94 percent, to fall to 33,747.87 within the first 15 minutes of morning trading. Dealers said prices were lower almost across the board. An analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said the plunge was largely due to the yen's sharp drop. Other dealers said expectations for the possible official discount rate hike by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> also discouraged market players. Market analysts and media reports have speculated that the bank will raise the rate soon, in part to combat the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar's excessive rise against the yen The central bank has made no official announcements.

<HEAD>Technological Advances Pose Threat to Protectionism, Fed Chairman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Monday protectionism in world trade will become increasingly difficult to sustain as technological advances continue and the goods being traded get physically smaller. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, speaking at the annual dinner of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said that as technology has progressed, economic growth has shifted toward analytical advances rather than producing an increased physical volume of goods. Once-bulky radios now are powered by pocket-sized transistor packs, metal beverage cans are thinner than they once were, tiny fiber optics are being used in place of tons of copper, and new buildings use less concrete, glass and steel than they once did, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in citing a few examples. This `` marked downsizing of economic output'' has made it easier for goods and services to move across national borders _ and creates a dilemma for countries that want to restrict trade, he said. `` The extraordinary downsizing of goods will make protectionism increasingly difficult to sustain in the years ahead, in the same sense that repressive national governments will have difficulty in blocking the satellite-transmitted flow of ideas to their people,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said downsizing also could help relieve inflationary bottlenecks in the production process, as additional supplies from other world producers become more readily and quickly available to fill shortages. `` As we progress toward general downsizing of economic output, worldwide production and inventory controls become far more feasible and inflationary dislocations less likely,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He said that while a major world economic disruption could quickly bring back earlier protectionist barriers, `` technology is irreversible. The downsizing of goods will continue. `` As a consequence, the ability to suppress worldwide trade will become progressively more difficult in the decades ahead,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> cautioned that while the world trading system generally has become more open since the end of World War II, `` we also have seen some significant steps backward.'' `` We do not now have as liberal a trade and marketing environment as we will require if we are to continue to reap the benefits of specialization, downsizing and technological change,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the coordinated efforts of the seven major industrialized nations, which now hold annual economic summit meetings, should help hold back protectionism. `` This process is bound to expand and become ever more pervasive as the cross-border trade in goods and services grows as a proportion of world domestic demand,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was introduced at the dinner at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel by his predecessor as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s board.

<TEXT>
 An oil company executive said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill was the catalyst for gasoline price increases around the country that would have occurred anyway by mid-summer. With worldwide oil production down and crude oil prices up since November, gasoline prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were bound to go up, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, manager of the economic department of <LOCATION> Chevron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. Since the first of the year, retail markets had been resisting upward pressure on gasoline prices, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. However, he said, the `` massive uncertainty'' surrounding the continued flow of oil from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground March 24 in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> opened the way for price increases. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was one of several oil executives who attended a meeting of top justice officials from seven states and representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> called by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. Earlier Monday, an economist said the loss of the oil from the Exxon Valdez could not be blamed for rising gasoline prices because <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cost </ORGANIZATION> refineries kept up production despite a brief drop in crude oil shipments from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` It did not have the impact in the production of gasoline,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said his research indicated gasoline price increases were linked to rising `` refinery margins,'' or increases in the difference between the prices refineries pay for crude oil and the prices they charge for finished products. Other oil companies were invited to the meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic-Richfield </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, whose Exxon Valdez tanker caused the spill, agreed to private meetings later in the week at <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> Attorneys general from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> attended the meeting, along with top deputy attorneys general from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The meeting preceded the summer driving season, which begins this weekend. <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> was hired by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and other Western states to analyze gasoline price increases after prices shot up between mid-March and mid-April by an average of 20.1 cents in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, 16.9 cents in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and 18.6 cents in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The tanker spilled 10.9 million gallons of crude oil, and restrictions imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> curtailed shipments of Alaskan crude oil for nearly two weeks afterwards. However, <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said, despite the `` loss'' or late delivery of 546 million gallons of crude, gasoline production remained steady, with only a slight dip in the week after the accident. The economist said crude oil prices and retail gasoline prices both jumped right after the accident. Uncertainty over how the spill would affect supplies of crude oil probably was behind the increases, <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said. Crude oil prices then dropped as the international oil market adjusted to the dip in Alaskan supplies, <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said. Dealer margins, up right after the spill, also dropped, but the price of gasoline kept going up, he said. What went up, and did not come back down, were the refinery margins, <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said. In the midst of `` massive uncertainty'' over whether gasoline supplies would fall, <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> said, refineries were able to increase their margins. `` You and I see that reflected in the price we pay at the pump,'' he said. <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> told the state officials that he was unable to say whether the refinery margins, which still were going up six weeks after the spill, were justified.
